    Alexander Joseph "Lex" Luthor
   </b>
   (after 1983
   –2019; resurrected 2019) is a billionaire industrialist, inventor and scientist, as well as one of the most intelligent people in the world. He is the son of the late
   Lionel Luthor
   and the late
   Lillian Luthor
   , the older paternal half-brother of
   Lena Luthor
   and the best friend-turned-archenemy of

   Lex is a charismatic and well-known, yet controversial public figure, as well as the CEO of
   Luthor Corp.
   In the original multiverse, he was succeeded by his half-sister following his incarceration of 32 consecutive life sentences at
   Stryker's Island Penitentiary
   .
  </p>
  <p key="15d20246-367c-4bdf-b71f-2f7e7325319a">
   Later, Lex managed to escape from prison to continue his war against
   Kryptonians
   , eventually being killed by Lena.

  <p key="506d1329-b3b0-4e20-bc72-0ecd9b573f72">
   As a result, Lex became one of the few individuals whose memories of the original multiverse were left intact within a

   , where he has no criminal history. After
   Leviathan
   was defeated by the
   Superfriends
   , Lex began his final battle against the heroes, resulting in Lex imprisoning
   Supergirl
   within the
   Phantom Zone
   .
  </p>
  <p key="b67e89d1-a765-4242-bd50-1c542d98b702">
   After the battle, Lex was arrested and once again stood trial, his crimes exposed to the whole world to know. However, Lex did not go to prison, having won sympathy from the jury by using Eve and Lena's involvement in his schemes to discredit their testimony and spinning the truth in his favor.
  </p>
  <p key="4566fe63-5b75-4e1b-90e6-ef362b7eab23">
   After the trial, Lex traveled to the 31st century to lay low, where he fell in love with

   , whom he saw as his equal. Several months later, he returned to the 21st century after his Nyxly died, and is now working with the present day Nyxly to prevent her death in the future. In the end, both Lex and Nyxly were imprisoned in the Phantom Zone.

   Lex Luthor was born sometime after 1983
   in
   Metropolis
   to billionaires
   Lionel
   and
   Lillian Luthor
   . He hails from one of the city's wealthiest and most prestigious families. Since early childhood, Lex exhibited an extremely high intellect, which made his mother greatly proud of him, often referring to her son as a "genius" and being very close to him as he grew up.
  </p>
  <p key="8685bed1-a2ab-4351-b0b9-4364d8023e30">
   As a child, Lex learned to play chess from Russian grandmaster
   Anatoly Karpov
   .
   An introverted boy, Lex had a dog named
   Ignatius
   , whom he considered his closest companion. When Lex was 7 years old, Ignatius fell ill and had to be put down. Lex wanted to be present at the procedure, but Lillian felt that her son was too sentimental and forbade it, forcing him to go on a business trip with his father instead. There, the duo were accompanied by
   Elizabeth Walsh
   , a woman to whom Lionel gave all of his attention. At first, Lex swore to himself that he would loathe Elizabeth for taking his father from him when he needed him the most, but couldn't keep his promise because of how kind she was to him. On the day they put down Ignatius, Elizabeth embraced Lex and sang him a beautiful Irish song in order to comfort him. By the end of the trip, Lex wished that Elizabeth was his mother.
  </p>
  <p key="38200130-b045-49ea-9dde-c1a0fc9368b2">
   In 1997, after
   Lena
   (whom Lex figured out early on was secretly Lionel's illegitimate daughter with the woman on their business trip) was adopted into the
   Luthor family
   after her mother's death, Lex made her feel especially welcome.
   When they first met, he invited her to play a game of chess that the four-year-old girl eventually won.
   After this, they started playing chess together often, regularly leaving secret notes for each other inside chess pieces.
   Sometime later, at the age of 13, Lex read the entire biography of
   Oscar Wilde
   and began impersonating him to the point of asking for weeks to being called by the author's pseudonym, Sebastian Melmoth.
  </p>
  <p key="2170cbf4-7e57-4757-862f-325bc1746fd9">
   During their youth, Lex and Lena were very close;
   Lex affectionately referred to his sister as "The Lost Princess" like the Grand Duchess
   Anastasia Romanova
   ,
   and would always challenge Lena to succeed in her inventions.
   Despite constantly being very hard on her, Lex acknowledged Lena's potential and considered his behavior the best way to ensure that she would keep getting better.
  </p>
  <p key="6fdd869c-2f3a-43c2-8b95-f55b26023209">
   According to Lena, Lex would build anthills for days in order to make ants believe they were coming back home before setting them on fire.
   Also in their school days, both he and Lena had a Latin tutor named Ms.
   Krinick
   who, every time Lex misquoted
   Salutati
   , sent him to a corner and forced him to repeat "
   <i key="5fa410ef-6403-431c-8c0f-b52d25c4626f">
    Ego me non placebo
   </i>
   " ("I don't like myself") until his Latin improved.
  </p>
  <p key="11412918-fd57-4871-9fb1-cd213537b4e7">
   Despite being deeply loved by his mother and half-sister, Lex had a difficult relationship with his father, as Lionel was distant
   and favored Lena over him.
   Their relationship worsened when Lionel started heavily drinking, eventually becoming an alcoholic. Lex grew to hate his father because he stayed with his family, making their lives miserable.
  </p>
  <p key="9f7388cd-687f-4dd9-8da8-279c50ed1ec2">
   One day, Lena stole Lionel's prized fountain pen, a gift he received from the King of Jordan, in order to please Lex. However, Lex deemed the gesture "pathetic" since if Lena knew how brilliant she was, she didn't have to cry to gain attention. To escape their drunken father's wrath, they hid in their tree house, where Lex comforted Lena, assuring her that Lionel could not climb up. Lex promised that one day, he would have all the money in the world, which he will use build a house on the Alps for his sister in order to keep her safe.
  </p>
  <p key="f0811702-c0be-423b-b9ea-9b057591d0e2">
   Lex inherited the family company,
   Luthor Corp
   , after his father passed away, becoming the new CEO. He then hired
   Mercy
   and
   Otis Graves
   as head of the company's head of security and a member of security, respectively.
   Over time, Lex's relationship with Mercy grew deeper, to the point that she eventually became his closest confidant and frequent dinner guest. It was even strongly implied that there was a romantic connection between them.

  <p key="630ccba6-377b-465b-94aa-62345926dab8">
   At some point, Lex became partners-in-crime with
   Bruno Mannheim
   for illegal schemes related to Luthor Corp. With Lex's help, Mannheim laundered money through Luthor Corp, but he soon dumped Lex as his partner when the latter was investigated by the state. The center of the scheme were parking lots which Mannheim purchased through a subsidiary he bought from Lex. According to Lena, it was Lex's affiliation with Mannheim that sent him down the wrong path in his life.

    Jimmy Olsen

   , the young photojournalist who took the
   1st photo of Superman
   , in order to find out what he knew about the superhero.
   In spite of this, Lex and Superman would later become best friends and they initially worked together to repel the threat of alien invasions. However, Lex's methods were far crueler than Superman's, which set them at odds. Although Superman tried hard to trust his friend, defending him against the accusations of others and continuing to give him several chances to atone for his wrong deeds,
   Lex ultimately proved unable to forever deceive Superman, who eventually realized his true nature; this consequently resulted in a falling out between the pair. Shortly after this, Lex came to believe that Superman himself was the cause of alien terrorism, since his presence attracted extraterrestrials, and declared war on his former friend, becoming his greatest enemy.
   Lex's obsession with taking down the Man of Steel soon dissolved his relationship with Mercy.
  </p>
  <p key="a71ea3d4-84b7-47e3-9fd2-891ea4195ddf">
   After Lex started targeting Superman, Lena grew concerned for her brother's well-being and tried to help him, but he ignored her.
   Thus, their relationship quickly fractured as Lex kicked Lena out of Luthor Corp
   and proceeded with his plans to destroy Superman, committing unspeakable crimes. He tried first to use
   Spheerical Industries
   ' technology in order to pulverize
   <a href="Kryptonite.html" key="b4562d0f-7176-4a78-b14b-ce8b1b58a935" title="Kryptonite">
    Kryptonite

   (a mineral that he later began to study intensively) and spread it in the air.
   One of his subsequent endeavors involved triggering a fault line in
   California
   with an "earthquake machine", which was tended to by Superman.
   Another incident involved Lex creating and selling a series of battle armors he called "
   Lexosuits
   ", which Superman was not happy about.
   Lex would use the Lexosuit to even the playing field when facing the Kryptonian.
   Also, Lex wrote in his journals several possible methods to defeat Superman, one of which involved a crippling overdose of the drug of a certain
   Doctor Crane
   , while another consisted in using a sample of
   Pamela Isley/Poison Ivy
   's pheromone in an attempt to mind control his nemesis.
   Lex also had notes of his own way to do so by using
   Q-waves
   to get past Superman's invulnerable skin.
  </p>
  <p key="9842039e-8299-4b7c-9e47-7eefc70c1668">
   Over the years, Lex built many secret storage facilities around the world, where he kept arsenals of weapons that he collected to defeat Superman once-and-for-all.
   One of his hideouts was the
   Mount Norquay Bunker
   .
   He also converted his own
   cloaked mansion
   's basement into a bunker designed to protect him from any threats, only confiding in Lena of the mansion's location.

   Theorizing that Superman had hidden every weapon used against him by Lex himself or anyone of his many enemies into a "
   secret fortress

  </p>
  <p key="c735db9e-a75a-4bd7-92b7-1150a912ba9e">
   Lex went so far as to inject himself with

   After several years and various brutal encounters resulting in numerous fatalities, Lex and Superman had a final confrontation in early 2016, prior to which Lex turned Earth's yellow sun red in an attempt to de-power the Kryptonian, consequently causing destruction on a global scale.
  </p>
  <p key="f54cb699-b7ae-4ac7-b022-77d0d8e73129">
   Lex took Lena captive in his office in Metropolis while observing the results of his work from various monitors, as his half-sister tearfully told him that he didn't have to go through with his actions, Lex, quoting a sentence from
   Epicurus
   , claimed he was doing it for the entire human race, then, taking her in front of the window to listen to the citizens' cries of pain, commented that they were already cheering. When Lena angrily replied that he would kill millions of people as the world couldn't live under a red sun, Lex responded that not even Superman can and explained that humans had grown complacent and they must put faith in themselves instead of looking up to Superman. He considered it his duty to dispel the world of the notion that Superman was invincible since, by killing the Kryptonian, Lex would finally wake them up and show them what Superman really was; a false god.
  </p>
  <p key="12437b7a-fc8f-452f-88d9-d61efd471df6">
   Shocked after seeing him shoot down a
   Metropolis Police Department
   helicopter during his monologue, Lena commented in disgust that at least Superman was a good man, causing Lex to yell in anger that he wasn't and he (Lex) should be the "Man of Tomorrow" instead. Lena then asked if then was all about his ego, to which Lex answered it was for science as he wanted to see if the Kryptonian could bleed, since even gods can die. Then, a team of agents stormed into the office and Lex calmly allowed them to arrest him, telling his half-sister that one day everyone would thank him for what he had done.
  </p>
  <p key="d0533998-74f4-4c0d-939b-820a30de1499">
   Lex was somehow able to escape from them, being subsequently recaptured at his mansion after Superman managed to thwart his plans and finally defeat him.

   Two months later, he underwent a trial in which Mercy was a key witness, betraying him,
   also both James and Lena (the latter revealing she was wearing a wire when he turned the sun red) testified about his actions. Lex scribbled in Kryptonese on a sheet for the duration of said testimonies and as before reading the verdict, the judge asked him if he had any statements, he replied "Superman made me do it"; stating that he was trying to protect humanity from extinction since aliens lived among them and there would always be a "before" and an "after" Superman.
  </p>
  <p key="dccaab1e-b564-4f0d-b519-cec9d07fb694">
   After the judge condemned him to 31 consecutive life terms, she and the jury started to cough and eventually died poisoned, to which Lex pointed sarcastically that maybe 32 was better, being consequently dragged away by the guards.
  </p>
  <p key="e6f57237-fe0a-48fa-a298-1b8fb246581a">
   Lex was incarcerated for said consecutive life terms

   There he was visited by
   Eve Teschmacher
   whom he noticed amongst the crowd, calling out to him while being taken away from court, prompting him to have
   Otis
   recruit her since he recognized her as the fangirl who sent him several letters over the years. During their meeting, Lex asked her to infiltrate
   CatCo Worldwide Media

   copy of Supergirl

   Alex
   ". Relying on this, Lex convinced the copy to be "Alex" and accepted the offer of the Kaznian government to condition her in order to make her a weapon, then, after Eve recognized a soldier who had made the copy "uncomfortable", Lex ordered for him to be executed and later scolded Eve for flinching during this.

   He got close to the copy and asked her if she would like to learn how to control her strength, then having a first training session with her, and beginning to instruct, promising her to explain everything regarding her origins and sending her books and other material before departing due to his seventy-two free hours having nearly expired. Moving away, he asked Eve how the copy's existence could be possible, to which she replied revealing him about the
   Harun-El
   and her experiments with Lena. Lex complimented her and ordered her to ensure she got results with her research, then explained his plan to force a war between United States and Kaznia to foil it and become a hero in the eyes of public opinion, ordering Otis to manipulate his sister to create the
   Children of Liberty
   placing
   Ben Lockwood
   as their leader to serve as the "All-American Hero" to use as a scapegoat, while Lex came back to prison since considering it "the best alibi".

Lex decided to spend the time necessary for the cloud to clear up to tell the copy that she was one of the last Children of Krypton and that her task was to start a period of peace on Earth by bringing together all the peoples and fighting the champions of corrupt governments: Superman and Supergirl.
He also told her that Supergirl was her sister and robbed her of her place in the World.

   After a month, he took the copy to National City under the alias of "Linda Lee", in order to let her see how dissolute are the lives of the people that Supergirl protected. Lex also brought "Linda" to see
   Kara Danvers' apartment

   A few hours later, he was informed by Eve that the copy "has a conscience" and it could be a problem for their project, as she founded her while trying to approach Lena at CatCo, so, in order to strengthen her resentment towards the Americans, Lex ordered her and Otis to stage the bombardment of the house of the child that the copy saved, by an American aircraft carrier.

   However, after she discovered it, she attacked the aircraft, ignoring Lex's advice not to do it, and, after he stopped her and staged her attack at the platform to seem like an accident, he scolded her for having risked compromising all their work due to a moment of weakness, after the copy confronted him about everything he wasn't telling her, Lex simply replied she had "disappointed" him.

   Freed from prison on a mercy furlough, Lex was transported to
   his mansion

  </p>
  <p key="52e8c3db-352e-4d5e-8120-4bb02d1b5ad9">
   After he was escorted inside and handcuffed to a wheelchair by the federal agents, Lex explained that they never let him out of their sight as if they feared he would escape like a dog without a leash, to which Lena told him he would have done it, causing Lex to smile and told her he couldn't due to his condition, reminding her that he was dying. Lena replied sarcastically that she knew it, since in the past six weeks he only spoke about that during their phone calls. Lex told her that he was not accustomed to needing help, telling he considered it "weak" and "pathetic", as well that he would be saved if she tested the Harun-El on humans. After Lena firmly refused, he asked her what was the meaning of all he had done to help her have better resources to her work then, asking if everything she really wanted was "a front row seat to watching him die", to which she replied that despite everything he was her brother and she wanted to save him. They were interrupted by
   Eve Teschmacher
   , who entered the room in a panic to inform Lena about James, and was mocked by Lex who asked for a macchiato, telling her to call him "Lex" as it was easy to write.

  <p key="48a92702-72c2-47f1-a7bc-e8c53e16b31e">
   Once Lena came back from the hospital and asked him to help her work on the Harun-El in order to save James' life as well as his own, Lex commented on the irony of the two of them working together to save "Superman's pal," wondering what would their mother had think, all while staring at a painting of Lillian. While working at the Harun-El remembering the times they "worked together" as children, Lex felt sick and started coughing up blood, so Lena called a guard to bring him a glass of water but he let it fall to the floor, saying he could lick it like a dog. Before Lena could react, Lex told her that he was used to it since "he wasn't very popular in prison." He then told her that he was proud of her and her accomplishments, right before saying to get back to work as sentimentality would have killed him faster than his cancer.

  <p key="7898453d-ac7f-450c-a5f7-3cffdebaebc4">
   Lex was subsequently assaulted by an utterly indifferent government agent and, while Lena helped him by telling the agent to gave her the keys to his handcuffs, he told his sister not to blame the man as "He knows not what he does," comparing himself to
   Jesus

   Alex Danvers
   and was informed that James was about to undergo a surgical operation with a high risk of death. As she fell depressed and stated she couldn't save James anymore, Lex told her that he always knew she was his half-sister and revealed the beautiful memory he had of
   her mother
   , stating that, unlike him who was born from hate, Lena was born from love and even if the rest of their family lurked in darkness with pride, she would always fall into the light. Then he urged her to reach for James, telling her that he needed her.

  <p key="fc21a57c-66c4-49ce-bb72-300072de3294">
   After Lena left, Lex remotely cut off the backup power of the hospital during the power outage caused by
   Manchester Black
   , forcing his sister to inject James with the Harun-El in order to save his life. However, Lena realized what he had done and confronted him while he was having a cup of tea. Lex immediately admitted that he was responsible for the hospital's blackout as well as James' shooting in order to give Lena the incentive and a human test subject on which she could test the Harun-El to guarantee its safety to be used as a healing agent. When a disgusted Lena replied that she would never give him the cure, Lex, not surprised, revealed that he already had someone administer it to him.

   The FBI agent in the room then revealed himself to be Otis, thought to be dead and disguised by an image inducer, and he restrained Lena to Lex's wheelchair after the latter stood up and tore off his prison garb to reveal a sharp suit. Lex then called for Eve, who entered and shot another federal agent, revealing she was working with Lex all along. Lex revealed he had no intention of killing Lena, then ordered Otis to chloroform her and Eve to "take care of her." He then left the mansion, killing a handful of federal agents with the mansion's security systems and another group of agents with landmines hidden in the ground. Then, Lex prepared to flee by helicopter, only to be intercepted by Supergirl, whom he was happy to finally meet in person.

He then scolded Eve again for having flinched, but she reassured it was not because of the murder but for Otis, who was killed again by
   Ben Lockwood

   Afterwards, Lex transported Red Daughter to
   Shelley Island

As she regained consciousness, Red Daughter claimed that she had trusted him, prompting Lex to mock her stating that she should have been either stupid or naïve, since she had access to the Internet and thus all his personal history and should have known that defending Kaznia was not something he would have done and, especially, that he hated Kryptonians like her. Red Daughter told Lex that he should have killed her, however, he left the room stating that he had bigger plans for her.

After Lena asked him if he had tied the President in a closet, Lex stated that "puppets don't need to be tied"; then Lillian asked her children to play nicely as that was their first family reunion in years, stating her murderous son having duped the Earth to think he was a hero was something completely normal for the Luthor family, suggesting they had a cup of tea while Lex explained that everything he had done was for all of them, in order to have their family's name rehabilitated and take their proper place in history by revolutionizing energy worldwide using aliens as batteries with his last discovery. When Lena stated how vile his plan was, Lex quoted responded that he "doesn't see why men shouldn't be cruel as nature", to which Lillian noted that he should not quote

   A few moments later,
   Harbinger
   started to hear voices in her head telling her to prevent Luthor from taking the
   Book of Destiny
   so she went to the ship's library only to find the man already holding the item and opening a
   breach
   stating that "No Man Should Be Able to Fly" before to disappear in it. As the Monitor entered the room, he told Harbinger that was all part of his plan. Then, Lex went to

   Unimpressed, Clark said he wasn't Lex, to which he replied no matter the universe, Superman would always be his enemy as the Book of Destiny told Lex that his true name was Clark Kent, but he believed that was only true in this universe and that the Clark Kent in his own universe couldn't possibly be Superman, to Clark's amusement. Lex declared that he would kill him and every other Superman in the multiverse.

  <p key="7845f247-5ade-447a-8eb9-382dab4ac963">
   Lex pulled out a piece of

    Kryptonite

   , but because Clark had given up his powers, it had no effect and Clark snatched it out of his hand and threw it into a field. Lex was incredulous that Clark would give up the powers of a god, so Clark explains that he did it to have a family. When Clark was distracted by
   Earth-167's Lois
   calling for him, Lex angrily tried to punch him, but Clark easily caught the punch and decked him. Lex said killing a powerless Superman would be no fun and left through a portal, saying Clark and his world were doomed anyway.

   Clark Kent

   Over their several weeks in the Vanishing point, Lex and

   After the machine was completed, nobody offered to test it, so Supergirl forced Lex into doing it, prompting him to ironically ask her if she was mad at him for having killed her

   Maltus

   Then, Lex went on to find Mar Novu and interrupted his experiment, having already knocked his wife,
   Xneen
   , unconscious. Lex explained how Mar Novu's experiment would release the Anti-Monitor and doom the entire multiverse, but stated that he could help prevent that in exchange for Mar Novu killing Superman and Supergirl after he eventually gaining his powers. Right in that moment Kara arrived, having regained consciousness, and began to fight Lex, buying Ryan enough time to take Mar Novu to check on Xneen and convince him to let go of his experiment.

   Shortly afterwards, the other Paragons arrive and they all found themselves transported to the

   shadow demons
   while Oliver sacrificed himself to defeat the Anti-Monitor using his powers to open a breach, to which Lex understood they had to concentrate their willpower like ha has done while using the Book of Destiny, in order to "fan the flame" and create a

   In January 2020, the day when the Paragons gained memories of their Pre-Crisis lives, Lex woke up in his king-size bedroom inside his mansion while
   his butler
   was bringing him breakfast, surprised he asked if he was dead, however the latter stated he simply suffer from a bad hangover and suggested him to take some coffee. Looking out of the windows, Lex noticed that he succeeded in saving the world, to which
   his butler
   replied it was nothing new for him, ant that was the reason he was about to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, thus showing him an article that reported it. Pleased, Lex corrected his statement by saying that he hadn't simply saved the world but instead created a new one.

  <p key="9173e604-9e9b-4e75-a76c-fbdc0eec72ac">
   After taking note that, in the new reality he was known worldwide as a beloved and respected humanitarian as well as the owner of the D.E.O. He also has a much better relationship with Lena and has defended Supergirl to the President on multiple occasions. The former part of this news made Lex extremely happy, as now, in this new world, he was finally celebrated as the hero he tried to be; a man who always put humanity first in a world filled with not only with aliens, but now an abundance of
   metahumans
   as well.
  </p>
  <p key="1f25133c-dfd9-47af-9289-bcc4816af06f">
   He asked to see his sister and, seeing she was sleeping in his mansion, noticed that the Monitor has kept his word, then he injected Lena with a sleeping drug and asked his butler to take her to her house. Later that day he took part at the ceremony to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, giving a speech about the importance of being a simple human without any special power. Noticing Kara Danvers in attendance, Lex gave a subtle acknowledgement that he remembered the pre-Crisis universe.

  <p key="454cb7d6-2c00-451d-beab-b75daccd3277">
   Despite being the Paragon of Truth, Lex was not targeted by the Shadow Demons when the Anti-Monitor made his appearance on Earth-Prime.

  <p key="afcbf0e3-7ca0-472c-9750-e78f7f02a0af">
   Lex then went to his mother and told her everything about the multiverse's death and rebirth, which
   Lillian
   took quite lightly stating that what matter was maintaining their status in the new world, since both Lena and Supergirl were about to remember their past lives. Lex suggested to find the
   Fortress of Solitude
   to destroy the Kryptonians, prompting Lillian to suggest him to support Lena and made her his ally instead in order to have her on his side while playing the "long game".

  </p>
  <p key="8e2bcfaa-ad23-4823-bee8-83c9cd3343b1">
   Lex explained about the Crisis, the deal he made with Mar Novu, how he "forgive" her for having killed him and how they could now work side-by-side to create a better world, stating that Kara Danvers would never have seen the world the way they did, prompting Lena to spitefully told him he was nothing but Leviathan puppet before and now it won't be any different, to which Lex surprisingly asked what Leviathan was.

  <p key="ae757984-4028-41e3-b937-cfa2ba21e8df">
   Later, Lex began to search for information about Leviathan obsessively, and called Alex and Supergirl in his office at the
   D.E.O.
   in order to offer them a temporary "peace" to better work together against the common enemy, however they stated that there were no sign of Leviathan after the birth of Earth-Prime, meaning he was the only threat to the world in their view.

   That evening, after leaving his office, he visited Lena once more, stating that he knew she was skeptical because she couldn't trust him, so he placed a baby
   Truth-seeker
   around his arm prompting her to ask everything she wanted. Lena asked him if he really could help her with
   Project Non Nocere
   to which he answered positively, stating that he wouldn't cause any unnecessary murders, then as she asked when will he betray her, Lex declared that that would happen if their partnership would became inconvenient and that he knew she was planning to use Non Nocere on him. With this, the two Luthors shook hands, sealing their alliance.

   Later that evening he went to the ceremony to be awarded with the

   Then, after returning at LuthorCorp parking lot, Lex encounter Lena, upset with him since she waited him to no avail in her office to work on Project Non Nocere, which was far more difficult since the Q-Waves had changed on the new Earth; however Lex explained that she underestimated Leviathan and he was now working with Brainiac-5 to discover more about them, telling her that the
   Coluan
   is trustworthy as he now take his decisions using just logic, and asking her to question

   William Dey

   The next day, at the D.E.O. Lex asked Brainiac 5 why he didn't bring the Legion's cruiser on which
   Winn Schott
   arrived to stop his doppelgänger into one of their hangar as planned, promoting the latter to told him it was placed on Fort Harrison by Alex and he needed to use Winn's DNA to open it. Lex thanked him and prepared to leave when his situational ally asked him to call off the Toyman now that he had what he wanted, only for Lex to reply that he didn't knew how to do it and to take care of it on his own.

   her father
   and threatening to kill
   her mother
   as well. After she admitted that she had enough of killing, Lex replied that she was a good person and he would have set her free, making her his double agent and slowly starting to seduce the naïve girl.

   Lex then approached Gemma Cooper at a restaurant and discussed with her the various opportunities and profits that a business deal between Luthor Corp and Obsidian North could bring to both, stating that he could be a very good friend to her and their goals for a very long time, eventually managing to winning her over and making her advise Andrea to accept said offer.

  <p key="200f60ce-67f5-47c7-a94f-db285633108d">
   Then, Lex called Lena in her laboratory in order to compliment her for their success stating that they one step closer to defeating Leviathan for the good of humanity and, while asked what he has done to convince Andrea, he simply replied that he became closer with her company's Board Director.

  <p key="757ac683-d977-4e28-965c-2915208aedfc">
   The following day, Lex received Toyman's immortality code from Brainiac 5 and the resignations of Alex Danvers as Director of the D.E.O., he complimented with the agent for the success of the operation and appointed him as the new Director.

   Sometime after that, while Andrea Rojas launched the first promotional spots of
   Obsidian Platinum
   , Eve informed that she failed into infiltrating Gamemnae's ship as he requested her, since she was sacred that Leviathan would have harmed her mother. Lex quickly replied that he hired a team of
   Mossad
   agents to guard her mother 24/7 and reassured her saying they were a team.
  </p>
  <p key="44b1c143-ab4d-4a6f-be1e-f4fe0805efb1">
   Eve then informed him that she convinced Gamemnae to place her inside Obsidian North and that she found a glitch in the system, to which Lex instructed the girl that her role would have been to prevent Leviathan from fixing the glitch so they would need help in covering it up and he would gain their trust by doing it.
  </p>
  <p key="122133bc-c446-414c-94a0-08356f97b08f">
   Meanwhile Lex, posing as a bartender, approached
   Richard Bates
   while he was getting drunk after discovering
   his wife
   was cheating on him, prompting him to tell him his story so that he may help him, offering him his hacking skills to build the VR torture chambers.
  </p>
  <p key="4c1df241-b4e7-43e4-846b-a7ecfa448fe7">
   Few days later, Eve thanked Lex after he brought her a new apartment, telling him that nobody ever treated her like that, to which he replied that she should start to acknowledge how wonderful she was. Then he informed them on their mission's following step, helping
   Amy Sapphire
   into getting the technology necessary to blowing up Obsidian and letting her attack Andrea in order to offer them Supergirl's protection, thus gaining "Gemma Cooper"'s trust.
  </p>
  <p key="2ac50aee-7dc0-46e6-9c1b-3766bc52758c">
   Hearing this, Eve commented Lex's brilliance and confessed that she was starting to feel something for him, to which he lied, replying that he felt the same, but is better to wait until their enemy is defeated. He then proceed in making an experiment with two mice and Q-waves, disintegrating one of them.
  </p>
  <p key="3fcf9405-d4fe-4dda-a203-b56011e51ae8">
   The next morning, Lex assisted at Lena's first results with Project Non Nocere and complimented the fact that all the animal trial were successful, however when Lena stated that human brains were far more complicated, saying that before Crisis she was criticized by Supergirl as she was trying to "mind control" humanity. Lex reassured Lena that was not the case and informed her he organized
   Stryker Island
   's prisoner for being willing test subject in order for them to be reformed and sent back into the society.
  </p>
  <p key="0e53d712-966d-450f-85dc-a41b87627c35">
   Then, after being called at the phone, Lex reached for Brainiac 5 at the D.E.O. where he informed that he managed to reverse engineer Toyman's immortality code to use it against Leviathan but has discovered that they're techno-organic life forms hailing from
   Krypton
   's same solar system, thus they needed to find
   "their version of Kryptonite"
   to weaken them in order to inject them with it. Brainiac 5 suggested that the best way to do it would have been getting close to their base of operation, to which Lex pointed out that they didn't even know where it was.
  </p>
  <p key="5243c588-4674-40f9-96fc-caadfd00e829">
   In that moment an agent informed them that Andrea Rojas has been attacked by a terrorist in an attempt to prevent the Obsidian Platform's launch, although his ally commented the news as fortuitous, Lex, knowing that Gemma Cooper has invested in it, thought it was an extremely good occasion to getting close to Leviathan as he previously suggested.
Lex assigned Supergirl to bodyguard duty, which she firmly refused saying that it could be handled by the D.E.O. itself, however Brainiac 5 pointed out that the aggressor was likely a

  </p>
  <p key="fc563d3c-0aa6-4bf8-9a2d-8912459daf85">
   Then Lex tracked Gemma Cooper and offered her to deal with the situation since he could give them Supergirl's help. She initially refused but after Lex told her that letting him deal with the problem would have been the better choice for her and "her people" in order to protect their anonymity, she was intrigued and accepted but not before reminding her that it was better he didn't make promises he couldn't keep as their people doesn't gave second chances.
  </p>
  <p key="2c3fc6dc-4977-4b68-ae4b-59d05ecf2db5">
   That evening, Lex confronted Lena after her experiment on Stryker's prisoners failed causing them to develop vengeful feelings, she told him that she was probably as delusional as he was when he turned the Sun red. Lex replied that instead he remembered that while he was worried for their first contact with an alien race she find it intriguing and he fired her because of it but now felt that he has the possibility to change it and doing it the right way so he offered his help in fixing Non Nocere.
  </p>
  <p key="6121f8e5-c87e-462c-9e5f-1c68888b56c1">
   Later Lex was approached by Brainiac 5 who asked him why the D.E.O.'s resources didn't provide any help during the blackout, to which Lex replied that he had not to worry as Supergirl saved the day as always. After walking away, Lex met Gemma in his limousine and told her he could be the perfect man to represent Obsidian into the world and all he asked in return was to meet "her friends".

  <p key="9c7d79f8-ffb2-4aa3-b6fb-44d385946664">
   The day before he left US in order to begin his Obsidian Platinum's world tour, Lex was informed by Eve that people was starting to remain trapped in the VR as he predicted and took him to the warehouse where they kept them, explaining that
   Margot Morrison
   was put in charge of them. Lex replied by giving Eve a backdoor to allow Richard to hack Obsidian to get revenge on his wife's lover prompting the heroes to start investigating the VR; also he gave her a vial of poison.
  </p>
  <p key="a2d2bb30-e4fe-4725-8ca6-de78b99f5bc4">
   This caused Eve to ask him if he was asking her to kill again and why, to which Lex explained that he found her father's killer in Peru and that his name is
   Jeremiah Danvers
   , so he demand her to kill him to avenge her father, which she was happy to comply to. Then, he departed for his world tour, calling it the beginning of Leviathen's end.

   Qurac
   , after which he managed to archive a deal to distribute Obsidian Platinum VR lenses in his country,
   also, he became a board member of Obsidian North and, over the following two weeks, launched 32 satellites, one for every country he visited in his Obsidian world tour.

   After he came back he was bathed in gratitude by Obsidian's North, and a party at his honor was held on their main office, however, during said occurrence, he noticed that his sister left the party to visit Kara offering her support after hearing of her adoptive father's death.

   The following day, while playing chess with his mother, Lex revealed about that miscalculation, stating that he wouldn't take the risk of letting Lena rekindle her friendship with Kara. Thus he made up another plan to set up Supergirl and drift her apart from Lena once and for all, calling it a better plan despite Lillian stated it was a display of weakness, Lex exited the room after winning the game with a checkmate.
  </p>
  <p key="677be5d5-9125-44af-8749-71f924ca83bc">
   Then he called Eve in order to ensure William Dey will get the information he asked to his contact regarding one of the missing person kidnapped by Leviathan after they were trapped in VR, then recording the reporter's meeting at Kara Danvers' apartment with the latter, Alex and
   Kelly Olsen
   and showing it to "Gemma".

  <p key="e23807ae-6d14-4dbc-92e9-140d9bc001fa">
   Thus, Lex informed her that he knew about the true nature of her associate and wanted to help them, suggesting that in order to prevent them being exposed the better option was to spread fear.
  </p>
  <p key="ecb7c9be-4df7-4a92-8e24-303494cb50f9">
   Lex then visited Brainiac 5 at the D.E.O. and was confronted about his suspicious that he was using Obsidian Platinum for his own purpose instead of disbanding Leviathan. Lex explained that the responsible of trapping people in VR was Leviathan and not him, suggesting him to ask Supergirl if she had some kind of technology in the Fortress that could help track them.

  <p key="c4e77fc8-d9fd-4e11-bf63-769a2ad0c539">
   After Supergirl activated
   Myriad
   to counteract Q-waves and detect the missing persons, Lex visited his sister lab and, noticing what was happening suggested her to tell him where the Fortress was so he could stop Myriad before her experiment are ruined, however Lena didn't trust him, prompting him to give her his watch as a teleportation device, letting Lena go herself and sending a
   Morae
   with her, thus leading to the liberation of the baby
   Sun-Eater
   inside it, which put the world in jeopardy leading to many people seeking refuge in the VR.

After Supergirl and J'onn arrived, he told them that they should trust him since Leviathan was the real and common enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="4f806992-f147-43e6-afd5-b2d4ed902fac">
   Then after he went back to his office he was confronted and assaulted by Gamemnae, enraged at Margot's death and the Morae's imprisonment, Lex however assured her it was all necessary sacrifices, since Supergirl was starting to get suspicious and no one could defeat her since too many tried and failed, prompting Gamemnae to reply that she wouldn't right before leaving Lex's office.

  <p key="9a20b649-0108-4974-b816-604c1b50a2e6">
   That night, after he went back to his mansion, Lex found Eve with an heart-pattern apron after she prepared dinner for him. She stated she was happy that they could finally spent a quiet night together as a couple, to which Lex replied that in "another time and another world" they were, but that made him weak and it won't happen again.
  </p>
  <p key="3b600999-567f-4249-95f7-01fa53805340">
   Lex then explained that he have always manipulated her, the Mossad agents wait for his order to kill her mother if she ever betrayed him and that the man he killed was actually Supergirl's father so that she wouldn't get any help from her either since he recorded the murder. After Eve stated that he was worse than Leviathan, Lex corrected her saying he was better.

  <p key="a67ba863-a034-42c3-bf12-cafed7f5a9f8">
   Later, after recording a message for his mother explaining how he perfectly accomplished his plan, he looked at the watch he gave Lena and, tracking his last teleporting location, discovered where the Fortress of Solitude was. After a moment of hesitation, he couldn't resist his curiosity and decided to visit it himself.
  </p>
  <p key="67e917e6-2c34-42ca-b3bc-8dfb3e1fe617">
   Lex took an unspecified item from the Fortress and, while checking it and putting it on a suitcase inside the D.E.O. storage room, was approached by Brainiac 5 who told him he was behind the Sun Eater, pointing out there was a difference between manipulating Leviathan and helping them destroy the world, to which Lex replied that he had to convince them he was on their side even if it cost giving them weapons. After Brainiac 5 reminded him that people could have died, Lex reminded him that he has to believe in him, stating that sometimes for a greater good is necessary to break some "super-eggs" and then leaving the room saying he expect Brainiac 5 to trust the process.

  <p key="24734d33-a24d-4810-b60f-d22df8738b0c">
   Later, he visited Stryker Island, where the Non Nocere applied to the inmates has suddenly failed after weeks of apparent success, sending one of them in a coma. While checking on him together with Lena, they were approached by
   Steve Lomeli
   , whom Lex pretend not to recognize as his former prison mate on Earth-38. Then noting it was an isolated incident, Lex reassured Lena that he could easily fix "one broken inmate".
  </p>
  <p key="c8b3a13f-98ce-4cd5-98d6-7488c5d31813">
   Due to the attempt to fix the problem with the Non Nocere inside the man's brain apparently failing, Lena suggested that it might be caused by his survival instinct triggered during the Sun Eater attack having clashed with the program directives.
  </p>
  <p key="50d7cd3e-3b89-4466-84f7-b46baf60d542">
   After Steve asked them if they could fixed it, several other inmates started to display an uncontrollable aggressive behavior that overturned the program in their mind. Thus, Lena and Lex watched as said virus evolved and quickly spread throughout the prison.
  </p>
  <p key="a3c4a906-71ff-4112-b44f-08820556bad0">
   In order to stop the riot, Lex, Lena and Steve went through the prison to the warden's office to activate Lena's Q-waves generator. Then, Lex distract the prisoners using his teleportation watch until Lena managed to find the right Q-wave frequencies to shut down the glitch, apparently deleting Non Nocere completely.
  </p>
  <p key="6598d1f3-abc0-46d3-9456-4a31a40e8620">
   Later, after placing the prisoners back to their cells, Lex heard Lena's complain about Non Nocere being a fruitless project due to human condition needing pain, she also stated that she was stupid to believe she could "fix humanity", prompting Lex to admit that humanity has to be controlled by someone with a firm hand that must be a human and not an "arrogant alien".
  </p>
  <p key="86700c1c-b4e3-452e-a578-5e433667606e">
   He suggested Lena they could be humanity's saviors and, after she told him that he knew it since the beginning that her project was a failure and did all that due to his megalomania, Lex yelled her that he didn't sabotaged her at all, instead he supported her and put his own goals aside because she needed to see he project fail with her own eyes in order to understand "the true depravity of humanity" and that his way was the only one. Hearing this, Lena walked away calling him a "monster".
  </p>
  <p key="60402f9c-6272-4f14-ac32-d67c84589ab3">
   Lex destroyed the room in a fit of rage then, after a security guard asked him what to do with the prisoner, he gave them a bomb and told him to burn it, consequently causing an explosion. As he left Stryker, Lex received a call from Gamemnae, who told him that due to the weapon he took from the Fortress and gave them, she would sent him a car the following morning to "meet her colleagues".
  </p>
  <p key="755ce527-9b55-4c1d-b7d2-985eeeec5580">
   Later, he met with Brainiac 5 into his limousine and, after the Coluan told him that he took full responsibility for the D.E.O.'s destruction, Lex simply replied that it was "tax deductible" explaining it was his plan since the very beginning, since with the item he stole from the Fortress and the Kryptonite Leviathan could make Supergirl's life miserable and, in sign of gratitude he was finally invited to their spaceship. Making a toast at the event, Lex told Brainiac 5 to be prepared for the following day.

   The following morning, Lex was welcomed by Gamemnae inside
   Leviathan's headquarters
   , where the defense system started to suffocate him since he was recognized as hostile by the ship. Gamemnae promptly gave him a device similar to a brooch to protect him from the defensive system, scolding
   Rama Khan
   for not having deactivated it. Rama Khan reminded her that keeping it active were higher orders and noted that he still did not trust Lex.
  </p>
  <p key="e68c18b0-8c74-44fb-9b90-ba5162172645">
   Lex was then told to leave the Supergirl massacre to Rama Khan and his "colleagues" right before using the weapon he gave them, three Kryptonite-absorbing rings, to prepare for the battle with the Girl of Steel.
  </p>
  <p key="cd20d9b6-bc65-48e8-a4d5-deee992b0489">
   Later, Lex asked Gamemnae what was Rama Khan referring to speaking about the one giving orders, to which she explained that she answered to
   another individual
   ; then before Lex left the building he was told that he could keep the protective device since he earned it and that the following day would have been the last of the old era.
  </p>
  <p key="a0a9f0c4-2851-4a1c-8073-d79c205ca75d">
   Exiting the building, Lex met with Brainiac 5 in his limousine and told him about the defensive system, refusing to give him the protective device since he intended to wait for Leviathan to kill Supergirl and her allies before uploading the "Mortality Code" in their ship; Brainiac 5 reminded him that they weren't the enemy, causing Lex to reply that indeed they were heroes and thus would all be happy to sacrifice to protect Earth.

  <p key="a1e6154c-7d7a-4d1e-85d1-d0dec519fa0a">
   At the eve of Obsidian
   Worldwide Unity Festival
   , Lex informed Gamemnae that the satellite was launched, to which she lashed out, briefly turning into her true form and informing him that Rama Khan,
   Sela
   and
   Tezumak
   were having trouble with the Superfriends. Lex reassured her that it won't be a problem and asked her if she was ready to begin the end of the world, right in the moment in which Andrea called for them to begin.
  </p>
  <p key="43899b87-daaa-4f81-a7f7-204645213c91">
   Lex then spoke to a live planetary video inciting all the inhabitants of the Earth to join their festival in Obsidian VR. Later that night, after Supergirl entered the VR herself to stop them, Lex urged Gamemnae to send another assassin to take care of Supergirl's physical body, prompting her to activate Andrea as Acrata.

  <p key="d8d6a48d-2208-4557-98d2-e67223d11d10">
   After finding Gamemnae having a sort of short-circuit in Andrea's office, Lex realized Brainiac 5 betrayed him and reached for him at Leviathan's headquarters. After Lex yelled at the Coluan asking him why he didn't wait for Supergirl to die, the latter replied that he underestimated him as he would never let his friends die, to which Lex laughed saying he didn't underestimate anything since he knew since the beginning he would have chosen to shrink the Gods in a bottle instead of kill them but he didn't expect for him to chose suicide in order to do it.
  </p>
  <p key="4a0f9852-96f6-4235-a58e-b61d93f90eef">
   Taking away the bottle in which Brainiac 5 sealed Leviathan, Lex informed him that he succeeded in preventing Leviathan from killing Supergirl, thus forcing him to do it himself. Continuing, he said it would be fun right before mockingly saluting him and exiting the room. Then Lex teleported to his lab and gave the bottle to his mother telling her to "get to work".

   At Lex's trial, he spoke in obscure truths, painting Eve as a potential suspect and invalidating her testimony by revealing her previous infatuation with him. With his victory assured, Lex was prepared to be a free man until Lena stepped in as a witness and revealed he corrupted
   Non Nocere
   to brainwash people into loving him so he could kill with no opposition when it suited him. Lex snapped, stating that he had the courage to use power to better humanity, making him a target for those jealous of his greatness. Ensuring Otis set up bombs for an escape plan, Lex was utterly shocked that he was found innocent and let go; he had done nothing but tell the truth (like in his last world) but this time Lex had managed to win sympathy.

   At home, Lex played chess with Lillian, who was impressed he managed to "Houdini" himself out of what seemed to be a sealed fate. Lex retorted that for the first time he saw the value of pure truth; having wasted so much time lying, bribing and even threatening others to act as he wished. His new plan is to use the truth to trick the people into believing his version of truth.

Lex soon discovered that Lena had transferred some of his money to the Luthor wing of the children's hospital. Irate, Lex called Otis.

Nyxly spoke of her revenge often, glowing her joy.  They even got matching tracking bracelets so they could always know where the other was. Together, they created many things that merged science and magic together. However, Nyxly made a fatal mistake with the Totems that killed her.

   However, past Nyxly didn't want anything to do with him. Lex reunited with Otis, who was now on the board of directors (thanks to Lillian) during his absence. Otis suggested that if Nyxly loved him before, Lex should try again. Lex quickly devised a plan to get the Love Totem to her. However, Nyxly wasn't happy with the assistance and the Superfriends got the totem. Lex saved Nyxly from being imprisoned, revealing their future romance and that he was trying to save her.

     Lex is a human supremacist who genuinely believes his crusade against aliens to be a righteous one, as he committed unspeakable acts in his attempt to protect

      Earth
     </a>
     from alien invaders. He is a narcissist and a sociopath, with a complete lack of conscience, empathy, and remorse for his actions. Lex's derangement stems back to his early childhood, where he would frequently torture and murder animals, as well as constantly criticize his half-sister to push her to excel. According to Lena, Lex is willing to do anything or hurt anyone to achieve his goals. He schemes, manipulates, tortures, and kills without principles or mercy for his victims. Infamous for his extreme callousness towards the well-being of others as, despite claiming that he wants the best for humanity, he displayed no qualms about murdering millions in order to accomplish his goals, considering himself the real "Man of Tomorrow" being so misguided in said beliefs that he was sure, in the end, people would understand and thank him for his nefarious actions.
    </p>
    <p key="6ab5c501-3f86-4fd0-a7ef-8ed13a6d73da">
     Lex often presents himself as a calm, level-headed, patient, and sarcastic man, but he is very prone to losing his temper and yelling in a delusional manner. His ego, conceit, and megalomaniac trends are so great that, even while suffering a seizure under the watch of an utterly indifferent government agent, he couldn't help but compare himself to
     Jesus Christ
     , muttering to Lena, "Don't blame him. He knows not what he does";
     also he stated to be the only one with the right to rule the Universe.

     Lex was once best friends with

      Clark Kent

     (under the persona of Superman) as the two initially tried to work together to repel the threat of alien invasions, but his methods were far crueler than Clark's, despite Kal-El's doing his best to trust Lex, defending him against accusations of others and continuing to give him several chances to atone for his wrong deeds; the two ultimately fell out and became bitter enemies once the paragon realized Lex's true nature, with Lex, for his part, coming to believe that Superman himself was the cause of alien attacks, which led him to declare war on Superman, committing unspeakable crimes in his relentless crusade to take down the Kryptonian.
    </p>
    <p key="4cde4279-d55a-4a9a-a7f8-851118b0807f">
     Lex is ruthless not only towards aliens and humans in general, but also towards his own family members as well, as he hired John Corben to kill his sister Lena simply because she was going to rename the family company, which he did not take too all that well as Lex was proud of his family name, these negative traits of his are what eventually led to his incarceration. Despite this, he has proven to care for Lena as he does have a link he can't break with her and to some degree, he acknowledges that she is incredibly gifted as an intellect and a scientist, so he loves her in a twisted and narcissistic way due to finding them both "alike".
     When Lena finally kills him, Lex seems actually proud of her ability to bring herself to do so.

    <p key="27e2c22c-13e5-4809-8cac-5a8d130a60dd">
     Despite Lex having a difficult relationship with his father and falling out with his half-sister, he remained fond of his mother, since she seemed to agree with his views, he even kept a portrait of Lillian in his mansion,
     however, when he met
     Lena's mother
     during childhood, he wished she was his, though this may have merely been a young Lex's attempts to manipulate his family.
     In truth, even his bond with Lilian was nothing more than a façade. As he was more than willing to murder her in cold blood while she was imprisoned, as Lena explained to her, the clincher being that her cell number on a Blueprint of the prison they shared, while handing it to her mother showing the name Lilian written beside it in bright red; a sign of which is known to indicate of Lex's giving a kill order in his family.
    </p>
    <p key="8e3a1e7c-75b0-4a44-bec6-18ff04153166">
     Part of this familial enmity stems from the years of harsh tutorship his mother paid for to which, in his sister's words, damaged his already demented psyche even more; Lena stating how it contributed to him becoming a sociopath when a particularly
     shrill instructor
     of his would make him stand in a corner while repeating the phrase "I do not like myself" in perfect Latin whenever he messed up his studies. These resentments were made extant by Lex punching the eyes of Lillian's portrait out once after he was cured of his cancer.
    </p>
    <p key="76670709-0029-44e2-8615-f644d44c5702">
     Overall, Lex is completely capable of committing horrible crimes, such as mass murder, without hesitation, and displays a sadistically shameless side to him, such as when he gleefully took down federal agents using his mansion's security systems as he calmly strolled out of his own house. As well as cackling insanely while singing jovially alongside Frank Sinatra - My Way lyrics when blowing up his Kaznian allies battle fleet. He has proven to be several steps ahead of his opponents, even having had a hand in the events of surrounding the rise of the
     Children of Liberty
     and Lena's experiments with the
     Harun-El

     Due to Lex's profound derangement, he is unable to form any real attachments with those around him and will do anything to complete his goals, and according to Lena, Lex is incapable of truly empathizing or caring for anyone, Lex shows this by manipulating
     Red Daughter
     and attempting to murder a child, the one person she cared for most, just to get her to start a war with Supergirl, Lex is seemingly incapable of genuinely caring for anyone and uses those around him for his own means, which he is very good at disguising as caring. Also, he gives apparently no value to life at all, as he planned to eradicate
     Argo City
     solely because his mortal enemy, Superman, was there, completely disregarding the thousands of bystanders, putting his preeminent hatred of Kryptonians ahead of the loss of innocents.

     Despite Lex's intelligent and calculating traits, he is extremely arrogant and egotistical to the point of being delusional, as Lex believes himself to be the most intelligent individual on the entire planet, completely disregarding the fact that Clark (under the persona of Superman) is slightly more intelligent than him; which eventually led to his downfall at the hands of the Kryptonian, even after being defeated by Clark, he still believes himself to be wiser than the latter; a sign that Lex is not only incapable of acknowledging his mistakes, but he is also incapable of learning from them as well.
    </p>
    <p key="dbd0c0b3-0fc5-4207-88b5-e426248e06f8">
     Lex is proven to be extremely overconfident; for example, he believed no matter how much Lena despised him, she would never kill him, not only does he finds out the hard way that he was wrong, but he also realizes that he has been underestimating his half-sister from the beginning, despite this, Lex accepts his fate with dignity.
    </p>
    In Lex's final moments, he has proved to be spiteful and vindictive, revealing to Lena that her best friend,
    Kara Danvers
    is Supergirl and that the Kryptonian, along with shared associates, have all been lying to her from the beginning, thus; damaging Lena's friendship with Kara.

He also seemed to have become less willing to cause innocent deaths, as he openly admitted that he would help Lena with her project and ensure there won't be too much who died.
     Most notably, Lex was much happier. Finally getting the recognition for all his hard work for putting humanity first in his scientific pursuits. However, at least some of these traits are merely a facade, as in truth, he still desires to control humanity, but in a twisted manner to make the world a better place.

Even after unintentionally causing his mother's death, Lex only felt anger towards her and entered into a short lived "lover spat" that nearly destroyed

    Later on, despite sustaining two gunshot wounds to the chest from
    Lena Luthor
    , Lex refused to give in to his wounds until he fully revealed to a dismayed Lena that her best friend,
    Kara Danvers
    , is Supergirl - successfully damaging his half-sister's friendship with Kara.
    His willpower is strong enough that he was able to use the Book of Destiny without losing his sanity in the process.

     Intimidation:

    Lex is universally regarded as an extremely dangerous individual and among Earth's most feared men; he commands an intimidating presence, to the point where most humans and aliens are afraid of him.

     Mental instability:
    </b>
    Lex is extremely arrogant, erratic, cruel, unstable and delusional, believing himself intellectually superior to the rest of the world and

    . He grew to resent Superman's popularity with the public and his animosity against the superhero eventually corrupted him, resulting in all of Lex's personal relationships collapsing, including that with his half-sister,
    Lena Luthor
    and his then-girlfriend,
    Mercy Graves
    .
    Lex even went so far as to inject himself with

    to keep his obsession at bay.
    He is also very overconfident about his schemes and takes no further caution beyond his initial plans, greatly losing his temper if something happen beyond his expectations.
    The fact that Lex had not learned from Superman's ability to defeat him - not only in direct combat, but also outsmart and reveal his crimes to the public - also proves that he is incapable of learning from his mistakes, as Lex still proclaims to be the strongest and most intelligent individual on the entire

    Despite Lex's intellect, he completely lack any ability to emotionally connect with others; though he was able to figure out on his own that
    Kara Danvers
    is Supergirl, Lex failed to realize Superman's secret identity as Clark Kent, simply because he can't imagine a frail human like Clark to be someone as powerful as Superman and simply deeming it as "ridiculous".

    that Lex has an obsession with destroying Kryptonians or proving that he is better than they are intellectually. This obsession has been used to the advantage of the Superfriends to distract Lex from other maneuvers on their part.
