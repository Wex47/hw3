   , going through security. While her credentials are being checked, an
   A.R.G.U.S.
   security threat alert pops up on the computer screen. Another guard appears behind Nyssa, ordering her to put her hands in the air. Nyssa seemingly complies, only to instantly disarm him and take down the other security personnel who attack her.

   In

   Tempest
   had made a monetary withdrawal into
   Starling National Bank
   . Walter says he will ask Moira about it, and thanks Felicity for bringing it to his attention.
   Mark Francis

   Oliver arrives at a hospital room where Laurel, Quentin, and Dinah are in. Laurel refutes her father's belief in that she overdosed, but that she merely fell unconscious. A nurse comes in and states that they need to check Laurel's eye, as there could be some hemorrhaging from her hitting her head when she passed out. As Oliver departs, he kisses Laurel on the cheek and briefly glances into her "damaged" eye, seeing a yellowish reflection in her pupil. As they depart, Laurel holds Quentin back, and confides in him that she vividly saw Sara, even though she espouses that she was only hallucinating.

   Quentin is sitting at a diner when Sara arrives. Sara hugs him and Quentin asks her to stay for a cup of tea. He points out that Sara just can't keep popping up every time one of her family members is in trouble, as it's not the way to live, and she needs to face things. Sara simply hugs her father again, and then walks out.

   While walking down an alley, Oliver watches Sara leave, and is surprised when Nyssa appears from the roof. She walks towards Sara with a dagger in her hand. Oliver steadies his bow, prepared to shoot. When Nyssa is close to Sara, she instead kisses her. Oliver lowers his bow, in shock (and briefly smirks at the view). Nyssa then breaks the kiss and mentions Sara's "boyfriend". Nyssa expresses her desire to bring Sara "home" to the League of Assassins, but the Arrow won't hear of it. Sara takes Oliver aside and tells him to trust her.
