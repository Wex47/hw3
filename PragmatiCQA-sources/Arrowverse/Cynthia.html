   She came to
   Earth-1
   to collect
   H.R. Wells
   due to him breaking the inter-dimensional travel ban on Earth-19. Her capture was interrupted by
   Cisco Ramon
   , who challenged her to trial-by-combat. Cynthia was defeated by Cisco and she returned to Earth-19 without
   H.R.
   claiming that he was already dead when she had found him. Later, on an assignment on
   Earth-2
   , trying to catch another breacher, Cynthia was captured by
   Grodd
   and forced to open a breach to Earth-1 for Grodd and his army to travel through to Central City. She helped Cisco and the team get rid of the gorillas on Earth-1 and went back to her Earth. She later returned to save Cisco from
   Savitar
   and
   Killer Frost
   , joining the team to defeat the two rogues. After trying to help in the battle with
   Clifford DeVoe
   , she became the ex-girlfriend of
   Cisco Ramon
   of Earth-1.

   At some point Cynthia was partnered with a fellow collector who she later became romantically involved with. In 2014 Cynthia and her partner encountered a breacher from the 64th century of Earth-1 named
   Abra Kadabra

   Cynthia appeared through a
   breach
   , bringing up a holographic photo of
   H.R. Wells
   ,
   searching for him in order to punish him for his crimes of inter-dimensional travel. She went to
   CC Jitters
   , picking up a coin and vibing his location, before knocking out two cops and leaving. The following day, she tracked him down to
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   . She was able to easily fend off
   Cisco Ramon
   and
   Kid Flash
   , before giving H.R. an hour to get his affairs in order. When she returned, she was challenged to a trial-by-combat by Cisco, allowing him the customary twenty-four hours to prepare. Later that day, while drinking coffee from Jitters at the waterfront, she was approached by
   <a href="Barry Allen (Earth-1).html" key="eb45996b-4768-41cb-8715-d05673057787" title="Barry Allen (Earth-1)">

  <p key="9d4a9ccb-4fee-4e54-aa26-94f061e0eac1">
   The following day,
   Vibe
   arrived, before the two began to fight. They crossed through a number of universes, before returning to
   Earth-1
   , where Cynthia was caught off guard. Admitting defeat, Cynthia allowed H.R.'s freedom, along with her life. However, Cisco declined taking the latter. As she prepared to leave back to her Earth, Cynthia asked that H.R. never return, as she would pretend she'd killed him, thus remaining unrivaled. She was also going to bring back a giant sack filled with coffee as they didn't have it on Earth-19. As she and Cisco went to kiss, Cynthia opened a portal, returning to her universe.

   While she was chasing a dimension hopping fugitive from her Earth to
   Earth-2
   , Cynthia somehow found her way to
   Gorilla City
   , where
   Grodd
   took control of her and prepared himself to use her power to have him and his army cross to Earth-1.
  </p>
  <p key="35c2d5fb-17b5-4a50-91af-24828708a8cb">
   Grodd used Cynthia to open a breach to Earth-1 for him and his gorilla army. He then sent Cynthia to attack Team Flash at S.T.A.R. Labs where
   Harry Wells
   managed to subdue her with one of his weapons. She was then locked in the
   Pipeline
   where she didn't seem to remember attacking them. She told them that the last thing she remembered was chasing a dimension hopping fugitive from her Earth to Earth-2 and then came upon a gorilla; that made the team realize that Grodd had taken control of her and must already be on their Earth as he couldn't control her between Earths. They asked her to help them but Cynthia refused and left to continue her pursuit of her fugitive. She then returned to her Earth where she met with the
   Accelerated Man
   and told him that she had found and terminated her mark. When he left, she was visited by Cisco who again asked for her help. She eventually decided to aid them and helped get
   Solovar
   to battle with Grodd and take back control of the gorillas. She then helped Cisco send the gorillas back to Gorilla City. Before she left, she and Cisco shared a goodbye kiss.

   Cynthia tracked down Abra Kadabra to
   Earth-1
   , and found him fighting the Flash. After Kadabra vanished to S.T.A.R. Labs, they eventually managed to imprison him, but he told Barry that he knew the identity of Barry's nemesis
   Savitar
   , and would tell him if they released him. Cynthia wanted to bring Kababra back to Earth-19 to stand trial for his crimes, but Barry and
   Joe West
   considered his offer. She revealed to Cisco that Kadabra killed her partner on Earth-19, and was determined to capture him, which she finally had a chance to do. Suddenly, Cynthia discovered that Joe was releasing Kadabra, and when he was about to tell him Savitar's identity, Cynthia arrived and Kadabra escaped to
   Eobard Thawne
   's
   Time Vault
   , where he stole a power source that he needed to power his time machine which would return him to the 64th Century. Cisco managed to track down Abra Kadabra by using satellites to detect his unique energy signature. They found him attempting to travel back to the future. Eventually they manage to stop him and Cynthia returned him to Earth-19 where he was presumably subsequently executed for his crimes.

   When Cisco was captured by Savitar and Killer Frost, Cynthia sensed his danger and rescued him. He complained about it and she revealed to him that she was mentally connected to him. Afterwards, during the final confrontation between Team Flash and Savitar, Cynthia joined Cisco in combat against Killer Frost. After they succeeded in taking her down, Savitar ran into Cynthia to knock her down before he took hold of Cisco and tried to kill him, only for Killer Frost to save Cisco. Savitar was defeated, and the team returned to S.T.A.R. Labs.
  </p>
  <p key="34e5a623-c3fc-44ff-ba00-4ff13645cfb9">
   In the following 5 months, Cisco and Cynthia grew closer and their relationship escalated. On Earth-19's "1-1-1" holiday (described by Cynthia as a holiday celebrating "when one soul plus one soul equals one soul", most likely the equivalent to Earth-1's Valentine's Day), Cynthia planned to go on a date with Cisco, but he couldn't make it and she got upset with him. However, they eventually celebrated the holiday, with Cynthia wearing a dress.
  </p>
  <p key="0e41a512-b6db-461e-9c8e-85f7386b7fc4">
   Hooking up one night, Cisco attempted to find out Cynthia's real name, but she refused to tell him. She left to use the bathroom, requesting Cisco lose his clothes while she was gone. While she was out of the room,
   her father
   appeared, attacking Cisco. Reaching a peace, Cynthia allowed Cisco to take her father back to S.T.A.R. Labs, before the three of them went to
   CC Jitters
   to grab a coffee. Breacher, however, recounted how his Earth's coffee crops had all been wiped out, so he abstained from ever drinking coffee again. Cynthia offered to go grab him a tea instead. When she returned, they'd left, and she deduced he'd begun hunting Cisco. Following the 24 hour period, Cynthia and Breacher went to leave, the latter expressing both his dislike and respect for Cisco, before calling Cynthia by her name, Cynthia, much to Cisco's delight. The pair then left to deal with a code 17 breach.
  </p>
  <p key="9cd0a94f-4a96-4d9f-9208-e3d8ee9d2ab7">
   Cynthia later sent Cisco a Christmas present from Earth-19. Cisco mistakenly assumed the device to be a break-up cube despite protests from
   Harrison Wells
   that it wasn't. Cisco opened it, only for it to play a sexy message from Cynthia with everyone gathered at
   Joe West
   's home overhearing it to Cisco's horror.
  </p>
  <p key="b165e013-67b2-42f8-9ce5-a0ad03be8aaa">
   Cynthia apparently sent Cisco many different cubes containing messages in hologram form, all of which Cisco kept. At one point, she sent a cube asking Cisco for his decision on whether or not to take her father's place as a hunter. Breacher had previously lost his powers due to old age and retired after asking Cisco to be "the new Breacher." Cisco did not answer the cube, not having decided yet (or at least not wanting to give an answer.)
  </p>
  <p key="aef51bfd-83a7-4442-a5a4-bc831c7f2cd8">
   Cynthia was later called in by Team Flash to attempt to co-vibe with Cisco to find where
   Clifford DeVoe
   would go next. They found that DeVoe was going to steal something from shipping container 16 at the Central City Docks. However, they discovered after going to the yard that they had seen the wrong container and had been too late to stop DeVoe. Cynthia attributed this to her and Cisco's recent problems in their relationship, resulting in them not being synced enough to co-vibe properly. Cisco then tells
   Team Flash
   what Breacher asked of him. Barry tries to talk to Cynthia, and get them to patch up their relationship so that they can find DeVoe. After failing to co-vibe again, they try to talk about their relationship. Cynthia reveals to Cisco that she doesn't want him to replace Breacher, and Cisco tells her that he is unsatisfied with them living on separate Earths. They are interrupted by Barry, who tells them that they are going after DeVoe.
  </p>
  <p key="98afba8d-b015-4d85-9dca-2f1499c195cf">
   As the both Clifford and his wife
   Marlize
   take a shot at taking the quantum PCs, Gypsy arrives with Barry, Cisco and Caitlin and attempt to take the DeVoes out. But Team Flash is defeated while Clifford utilizes his forces to strangle Gypsy, who starts gagging. Marlize gets up and persuades Clifford to stop. The DeVoes escape, and the team returns to S.T.A.R. Labs.

   After their failed mission, the group returns to S.T.A.R. Labs, where they learn DeVoe's plan. Cisco and Gypsy later vibe to the Collectors Agency HQ on Earth-19. Choosing to cut off their association, Cisco tells her that he won't leave Team Flash to replace Breacher. They say goodbye to each other, and go their separate ways.

   Eventually, Cynthia was able to track down
   Echo
   on Earth-19. The two started a duel in hand-to-hand combat, which Cynthia ultimately won. However, Echo revealed his identity to her, which turned out to be Cisco's Earth-19 doppelganger. She stopped attacking, and quickly breached him to Earth-1. That hesitation allowed Echo to use a transonic-demolecularizer on her, which vaporized her and killed her instantly. Her plan was that Earth-1's Cisco could unmask him.

   While Cynthia believed the law should be enforced she still had a good heart. Cynthia was very flirty with
   Cisco Ramon
   because she thought he's cute. She was shown to keep her word as she kept her promise of giving Cisco one day until their battle to the death over H.R. Like H.R., Cynthia had a great appreciation for Earth-1's abundant supply of coffee, shown by taking a rather large amount with her back home, as all coffee has been wiped out on Earth-19. To which, she is also shown willing to bend certain rules.
   Cynthia had been shown to be immensely dedicated to her job, single-mindedly pursuing her targets with frightening resolve, and treating them with very little mercy. However, when her emotions are stirred, she could be persuaded to give up the chase, help others out of the line of duty, and even outright lie to her superiors in a compromise with those who have defeated her. This could be difficult, since she appears not to like opening up about details of her life, even to people she's close to (such as when she refused to tell Cisco her real name).

    In the DC comics,
    Gypsy
    , also known as
    Cynthia "Cindy" Reynolds
    and
    Cynthia Mordeth
    depending on the iteration, is a skilled telepathic superheroine from Earth-1 who can cast illusions and turn invisible, with a similar counterpart on Earth 16. In the New 52 her relationships with Breacher and Cisco/Vibe are similar to the show, with little inspiration taken from her pre-Flashpoint character outside of including her skills as a marksman.

      Cynthia may also have been inspired by a minor Flash character, Peregrine. Peregrine was a female agent of the "Cronarch", ruler of the 64th Century, whom was tasked with hunting down time fugitive
      Abra Kadabra
      , considered to be a rebel and criminal in his home era. This situation resembles that of
      H.R. Wells
      being hunted by Cynthia because he'd broken the law prohibiting inter dimensional travel to or from Earth-19.
