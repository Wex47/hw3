   The Speed Force is comprised of
   positive tachyons particles
   that are infused with
   dark matter
   , allowing speedsters access to their main ability of
   super speed
   as well as their derived abilities such as
   time travel
   and dimensional breaching.
  </p>
  <p key="d0f95a0d-d203-4d5e-ba26-c1255ed8ee2d">
   The Speed Force itself is a vaguely explored concept and appears to exhibit forms of consciousness and intelligence; able to manifest itself to communicate with a speedster, using the visage of a person they know. Fallen speedsters may find themselves trapped within the Speed Force itself as a kind of purgatory.
  </p>
  <p key="08c4f37c-ae76-40fb-b9a3-fedb20830ee9">
   The Speed Force also has enforcers called

   to punish those who abuse time travel in order to prevent any further disruption of the timeline. Particularly dangerous time travelers or aberrations are hunted down by the
   Black Flash

   multiverse
   . However, traveling in it is very unstable and without

  <p key="1b534281-f128-4580-8aa1-105532650065">
   The Speed Force cannot handle certain extra-dimensional energies, like the Spectre's powers; interference of such energies will ultimately deteriorate the Speed Force, eventually "killing" it.
   However, since the Speed Force is an elemental part of the universe, it can never truly disappear and can be restored if its energy exists somewhere.

   The Speed Force itself claims to have existed since the beginning of time, and will exist until at least the end of the known universe. Whether this is physically true or just a metaphysical aspect of reality is unknown.

   While being imprisoned in the Speed Force, the legend of
   the time remnant of Barry Allen
   from 2020/2021 known as "Savitar" was spread throughout the
   multiverse
   and across time, with the lie of his power being the first speedster to ever be granted power from the Speed Force, eventually becoming the fastest out of all of them who desired to challenge other powerful speedsters who threatened Savitar's power to battle before taking over their Earths.

   time travel
   through a Speed Force connection. Upon discovering he'd never become a hero like his idol, Thawne became the Reverse-Flash and created
   his own Speed Force
   which made him immune to timeline changes, as well as able to avoid detection by other speedsters.

   After traveling back to the year 2000, Eobard Thawne lost his connection to the Speed Force due to copious amounts of time travel. Because of this, Thawne intended to regain usage of the Speed Force through a plan, killing
   Harrison Wells
   and his soon-to-be wife
   Tess Morgan
   in order to masquerade as Wells.
   Fourteen years later, Barry Allen gained a connection to the Speed Force by the

   thereby creating "The Flash" and the key of gaining more knowledge about the Speed Force.

   By this point in Thawne's plan, fifteen years have passed, during which time Thawne was able to use a
   tachyon prototype
   to access the Speed Force, absorbing some of it and allowing him to run at high speeds, and vibrate his body and voice.
   Sometime later, needing to remove
   The Trickster's
   kinetic bomb from the Flash's wrist without it exploding, Thawne motivated the Flash to become one with his speed, thus becoming one with the Speed Force, allowing him to better hone his ability to vibrate and phase through a tanker, leaving the bomb on the other side.

   When trying to travel back in time to prevent the murder of his mother,
   Nora Allen

To travel where he wanted to go, Barry had to think about a specific time and place, before transporting into his childhood home and into his bedroom, just as his younger self was walking down the stairs to see his mother trapped in the tornado of light, that was actually Reverse-Flash and his future self as the Flash fighting over the younger Barry's fate at super speed.

   S.T.A.R. Labs
   created by
   Harrison Wells
   . However, after becoming a speed demon name "Zoom", Hunter was proven unworthy due to abusing the Speed Force for his own benefit, such as killing others. The speedster also time traveled recklessly throughout the timeline, forcing the Speed Force to clean up his mess. Hunter later developed a
   drug
   to make him go faster, thus further abusing his speed to terrorize more Earths throughout the
   multiverse

   A few months later, Barry traveled back in time to where his former teacher, Eobard Thawne, was alive since he was desperate to run faster to beat Zoom.

   When Barry tried to regain his powers through a second particle accelerator explosion, instead of him simply regaining his powers, the will of the Speed Force pulled Barry into itself. It was inside of the Speed Force that Barry discovered that the Speed Force had a personality and could be spoken to. Before the Speed Force allowed Barry to regain his powers, he had to prove himself worthy of retrieving his powers again. In order for Barry to regain his powers, the Speed Force gave him a trial, to catch a dark speeding shadow. The shadow at every stop led Barry to places of great personal importance where the Speed Force manifested itself as an important person in his life to speak to him. During the trial, Cisco created a breach to the Speed Force dimension and a vortex of energy appeared to Barry. The Speed Force told Barry that if he did not complete the trial before leaving, he would be returning to Earth without his powers. By accepting tragedy and moving on instead of letting it define him, the Speed Force allowed him to become a speedster again with the shadow appearing before Barry so that he could catch it. The shadow was revealed to be a manifestation of Barry as the Flash before Barry transformed into the figure. Barry then left the Speed Force with the help of Iris calling out to him through the vortex after hugging the Speed Force's manifestation of his mother. After defeating
   Girder
   , Barry visited
   Jesse Wells
   in her coma where he touched her hand and a spark of energy woke her from the coma.

   The Speed Force later sent two Time Wraiths after Barry when he created a time remnant during his fight with Hunter. Upon arriving, however, they discovered Hunter and realizing that Barry used the time remnant to clue them into Hunter's location, the Wraiths spared Barry and attacked Hunter instead. Badly beaten and weakened from the race, Hunter could only scream in terror as the Time Wraiths surrounded him and began forcibly transforming him into a demonic-looking skeletal being, changing the lightning-bolt emblem of his costume red as well as its outline and the earpieces as well as turning the emblem circle white and turning his speed lightning red. The Time Wraiths then reopened their portal and dragged the decaying form of Zoom into the Speed Force. This made him lose his remaining sanity, his humanity, his free will and decayed his body to an undead state similar to that of the Wraiths.
   Months later it was revealed that he was transformed into the worst and most powerful version of time specters.

   Later, Barry Allen and

   attempted to trap Savitar in the Speed Force forever by throwing the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force via a wormhole that Barry and Jay had created. However, Barry was accidentally thrown five months into the future, where he sees a possible future where Iris West is murdered by Savitar, explaining that either Savitar was freed after being thrown in the Speed Force, or that the Philosopher's Stone would reappear in the future.

   unintentionally gave him the Philosopher's Stone, except a small piece that had broken off of the whole stone, which Savitar needed to free himself from the Speed Force. Hoping to use it to get rid of her powers, Caitlin kept this piece for herself. She later confessed this to the rest of the team, and when
   Wally West
   threw the last bit of the Stone into the Speed Force, he was dragged into the prison, freeing Savitar.

This, however, had very destructive consequences as the Speed Force had become unstable due to the vacancy of the Speed Force Prison, which in effect caused a Speed Force Storm which devastated
   Central City
   . Realizing that the only way to stop the storm was to go into the Speed Force Prison, Barry voluntarily went with the Speed Force for his past crimes of creating Flashpoint and his use of time travel.

Just then, however, Team Flash managed to recover Barry from his hallucinations, although they soon realized that Barry wasn't acting like himself. Barry revealed his infected body and raced out of S.T.A.R. Labs to submit to Ramsey, indicating that Ramsey was able to best the Speed Force despite its power, and fully infect Barry.
   However, it was soon revealed that Barry willingly submitted to Ramsey so he could defeat him from inside.

   When Barry attempted to use the Speed Force to travel to 2049 so he could check on
   Nora West-Allen
   , he was attacked by a group of Godspeed clones. After being knocked out of the Speed Force, Barry encountered Deon who told Barry that the Godspeed clones were feeding on pure Speed Force energy, but they couldn't hold onto it for long and kept coming back for more. Deon also told Barry that the Speed Force knew what was happening and had its hands full trying to exterminate the clones.

    Even though the Speed Force is an extra-dimensional source of energy, it proved to have its own personality. It took the form of several deceased individuals that

     After assuming a physical form, the Speed Force displayed a more human-like personality. It showed care toward Barry Allen while he was in a coma, even stating she was giving him as much as power as possible in order to help him heal. It was also able to realize how much Barry missed his mother, Nora Allen, whose form the Speed Force had assumed and feared that in doing so it was hurting him.

    <p key="9b561140-825f-46cc-ba75-ffece47772bd">
     The Speed Force eventually accepted being addressed by Nora's name, finding that it made conversing easier.
      The Speed Force had a very close relationship with Barry. Not only was it able to sense his feelings when he was in distress, but it also wished to comfort him or solve his problems. It also made observations about those Barry interacted with and wanted to observe any work that he was doing.

    <p key="72eb9ad7-618b-4b77-9de9-000abf96f68b">
     The Speed Force also showed a negative, immature and immoral side since its rebirth. It wished for Barry's approval (as its "father") but it also considered itself Barry's mother-figure and was vengeful towards Barry for disobeying and opposing it.

    <p key="c5b2f983-bda4-4589-b4e9-9442973c3107">
     Since the Speed Force absorbed some emotions from Barry and Iris, it feared things, such as death, recalling its poisoning by the Spectre energy to be like having its soul turned inside out. The Speed Force's fear of death led it to pursue the other forces of nature, fearing that they were attempting to kill it.
    </p>
    Once the Speed Force learned of and faced its true fear of being alone, it reconciled with the other forces and Barry, once again working as his benefactor.

   By tapping into the power of the Speed Force, speedsters can cause their eyes to transform in some way, either by being filled with yellow electricity, which can cause the surrounding skin to glow yellow, shining blue light, shining dark red light or electricity that can even cause the surrounding parts of the face to glow red, or the entire eye becoming pitch black. The first occurrence is the sign of a natural connection to the Speed Force and can even manifest for users of Velocity before the serum begins to degenerate them. The second, third and fifth occurrences are caused by a speedster tapping into the Negative Speed Force. The fourth occurrence is caused after the above-mentioned degeneration. The sixth occurrence is caused by a speedster being infected by Ramsey Rosso.

   In the possible future from which
   Savitar
   was created, the future Barry Allen used a
    Speed Force bazooka
    to create a prison within the Speed Force, in which he trapped Savitar.
    While the true nature of this prison is unknown, it seemed to become permanently inside Speed Force and still existed in a timeline in which the technology was not used on Savitar, even after he was erased from existence by his failure to kill
    Iris West
    . As such, the Speed Force would destabilize if there was no speedster within the prison, which would result in an inter-dimensional storm of energy that potentially threatened the entire planet if it was not filled.
    Aside from Savitar, the prison has been inhabited by
    Wally West

    The prison has been described as "hell" due to the prisoner being isolated and left unable to age or die, while it also forces them through an endless temporal loop of their most painful experience for eternity.
    This is what drove Savitar mad with a vengeance for Barry Allen
    and what nearly traumatized Wally West by having him witnessing

After the lightning storm fulfilled its purpose, Barry threw the quark sphere back into the Speed Force, stabilizing it once again.

They can also drag their targets through dimensions, which typically results in them becoming physically degenerated and taking on a Time Wraith's corpse-like appearance while turning their lightning red, as well as some parts of their uniform should they have one on.

   The Speed Force enhances all movement, momentum, and force exerting capabilities of its user, down to a microscopic level, as well as giving the user conscious control over it. This enhances overall acceleration, agility, reflexes, coordination, balance, and reaction time to inhuman levels. In addition, the body becomes conditioned beyond human potential, allowing them to handle extreme physical exertion and performance, which is also enhanced. The Speed Force is also able to have a sentient will, allowing their energy and properties to be given to a worthy user. As the Speed Force is connected to all of time and space throughout the multiverse, and even the
    Vanishing Point
    which is located outside of time and space,
    it has influence over these forces. Speedsters can move at inhuman speeds and perform acts that the human body is too fragile for because using the Speed Force gives those with a connection to it a degree of conscious and subconscious control over forces like inertia, kinetic energy, space and time. When speedsters use their powers, it is shown that they are enveloped in a kind of aura or space that is partially separated from standard reality or space. Users of the Speed Force have demonstrated the following abilities:

    All chemical, cellular and neural processes, as well as brain activity, are far faster than normal, which enhances the speed and efficiency of physical healing and metabolism to superhuman levels. This causes users to be able to be completely healed from non-lethal injuries as severe as broken bones, burns and even paralysis, in a matter of hours or days without any linger effects, therapy, or treatment, unless the injuries are immediately lethal. Users are also more resilient to physical impacts and collisions, giving them immunity to being stunned, dazed, unbalanced or staggered by great forces, especially while moving at super speed.

However, as time doesn't pass normally in the Speed Force, the weird time stream may have allowed Barry to survive longer in the Speed Force Prison then should have been possible. This decelerated aging may also have to do with a speedster's partial control over time which is one of the aspects the Speed Force is connected to.

    A user using super-speed while moving their entire body, or part of it in a repetitive motion, such as back and forth, spinning, or otherwise circular motions, can manipulate air flows and currents and therefore generate powerful winds and manipulating them with there repeated motions. These motions can also be achieved by the user moving or running back and forth or in a circle.

    Since these enhanced movements and acceleration capabilities affected the user microscopically, it allowed the user to manipulate the movement and acceleration of their cells, and even their molecules, allowing them to shake and vibrate their bodies or parts of it by willing their cells to do so. These vibrations can enhance physical force produced by physical contact and distort the user's image to the point where the user becomes a vibrating blur of motion, even when they are not using their speed. A user can disguise their appearance with this, as well as their voice by vibrating their vocal cords, which can produce an electronic, distorted voice or a garbled, deep growl. Vibrating also allows a user to cause tremors and jolt through physical contact, enough to perform feats such as breaking metal locks or part of a mug by touching the object or generating enough friction to level a bridge by running on it repeatedly. By vibrating their hand, the user can generate the force of a buzzsaw, enough to effortlessly punch and smash through machinery and saw through metal chains. Some users can even use their vibrations to punch through flesh and bone, much like phasing through solid objects, though it is unknown how they accomplish this without harming themselves. Also by vibrating their bodies at different frequencies allows a user to become intangible and pass through solid objects, even people. Some users can even phase objects into people or infuse various objects with intangible with physical contact, though this is especially straining. through people can be lethal, as villainous speedsters will often vibrate their arms through a target and cause them to drop dead. With this, they are able to phase into people, while still being able to touch and grab tangible objects, which allows them to damage the victim from the inside. However, it is not always lethal, as a user could phase into someone to pull objects, such as bullets, out of the person, to put something they are holding inside of a person without breaching their skin, phase their momentum-enhanced punch into the targets of greater resilience to incapacitate them, or even run right through others without harming them. The ability could even cause an opponent's attacks to pass through the user, even if the attacker is someone as powerful as
     Supergirl
     . Vibrating through something electrical, such as a computer, can cause it to overload and fry. Alternatively, vibrational energy can be channeled in order to generate a powerful sonic boom able to repel or hold down people.

The great amounts of electricity generated from the body have been demonstrated to be able to cause nearby electronics to glitch and fluctuate. This Speed Force lightning has been shown to vary in color between the differing speedsters seen so far.

       This aura also seems to affect kinetic energy and inertia as Barry was able to throw off the Turtle's ability to steal kinetic energy and increase inertia on his victims. This would also explain why speedsters can grab people at high speed without their momentum and kinetic energy ripping people apart or being able to survive impacts with objects moving so fast with only minor injuries.

Therefore, the user's mental speed and efficiency, as well as physical, is also enhanced to inhuman levels. They can see the world moving in slow motion, while others can only see them as a vibrating blur of motion, usually accompanied by an aura of differently colored electricity. This seems to be an ability that the speedster can control as Barry can shift his perceptions down to normal while interacting with regular people but reflexively move to higher levels of perception. This is due to the fact that a speedster's power is drawn from a connection to an external energy field (Speed Force) and can control how much power they draw from that connection rather than being a natural state.

This enhanced movement and physical force allow a user to be able to increase the power of physical impacts and collisions and generate the force to simulate superhuman strength by charging their attacks with extreme amounts of physical force. While this can usually be done only at super speed, most users can quickly learn to charge their attacks with force while at normal speed, or by attacking using a brief burst of super speed. With this, users not only can send people flying through the air but to smash through, crush and dismantle machinery and circuitry with only their fists or bare hands. Villainous speedsters have even shown the capacity to use this to punch a gaping, bloody hole through people, with some even tearing out the heart of their victim. In fact, some speedsters have used their speed to kill opponents though fatal high-speed collision. They can also cause tremors and jolt through physical contact, usually while vibrating at the same time, enough to level a bridge by running on it repeatedly.

       Time travel
        :
      </b>
      Advanced users can create a hole in the fabric of space-time and travel through time. They do with by entering the Speed Force which is connected to all of time and space through the multiverse. This allows them to safely navigate the time stream while being protected from temporal alterations.
       Harry Wells
       referred to it as the Speed Force protecting the user like a "bomb shelter" which is what allows Eobard Thawne to exist as a timeline remnant even after his bloodline is erased from time. Upon doing so, they can enter the timeline independent from themselves, or "merge" with their temporal counterpart to be reinserted with that timeline. When performing the later, should any changes happen to the timeline, the speedster will retain all memories of the previous timeline in addition to the new one, even able to differentiate between the two. This ability is also the most dangerous, as altering the events of the past in the slightest could distort the user's present and future, usually with devastating results. Adept users of the Speed Force can also detect when a speedster is time-traveling and can pull the speedster from the Speed Force. This fact led Thawne into creating the
       Negative Speed Force
       so he could time-travel undetected by his nemesis, the Flash.

        By generating enough energy, extremely powerful and advanced users can slow down time relative to them to a complete standstill (dubbed "

However, doing this for prolonged periods of time is very strenuous as the longer they keep this up, the more time will gradually return to its natural flow while the users will simultaneously grow increasingly exhausted because their bodies aren't used to such speeds. Users are also able to bring non-speedesters into "Flashtime" for a limited period of time.

While Barry has the ability to shift through time, he can also reverse the flow of time while running at a certain speed, while he remains completely unaffected. Ultimately, he can even grant himself a time do-over, wherein he enters the past and "merges" with his temporal counterpart to be fully immersed in the timeline. Nora is able to reverse time around her while running, remaining completely unaffected, such as when she stopped Barry from destroying the falling S.T.A.R. Labs satellite alone.

They do not always share the user's current personality as the further back they go, the less like their current self the time remnant becomes, but only if their past self is any different from their current self. If they shift through years, their time remnant will not possess their current memories and most likely not have their current personality. However, the user can shift back minutes and even seconds to create a duplicate that is truly the same as them. It has been stated that one needs to be willing to kill themselves in order to be able to create them. This action changes the timeline so it is possible traveling just a few seconds into the past pulls a version of the speedster from a different timeline.

Savitar has demonstrated a complete mastery of this ability, to where he can instantly warp to anywhere in Earth-1's Central City. However, it's possible that the reason for this is because, at the time when he was shown to be able to do this, he was trapped in the Speed Force, and subsequently fast enough that he was completely invisible to non-speedsters, even when standing still as the Speed Force bends space and time allowing him to travel further in less time. After tricking Wally into freeing him from the Speed Force prison, he was slower, enough so that he was visible to non-speedsters.

If that connection is somehow cut off or severed, either temporarily by the speedster being in a place that dampens the connection to almost nothing, or permanently by some external force (such as operating in "
     Flashtime

     Electricity absorption:

    Speedsters' unique biology causes their bodies to produce massive amounts of electricity, which charges their molecular structure and allows them to accelerate their movement. Should a speedster be drained of this electrical energy, they will lose their power. However, the Speed Force is genetically coded to their DNA, meaning they are incapable of losing their potential for enhanced speed. If this electricity is absorbed by another source, all of their powers will be suppressed, including their superhuman healing and accelerated perception. Much like an electrical device, which needs to recharge, speedsters must electrify themselves to a great extent in order to jump-start their powers once more.

     Hyper-metabolism:

    While moving at accelerated speeds, speedsters burn calories much faster than normal people. This requires them to consume large amounts of nutrients (about 10,000 calories from a single day of exertion)
     to maintain peak physical performance. Continued usage of their speed while deprived of a sufficient quantity of nutrience will render them disoriented and weak before ultimately passing out as a result of low blood glucose. Also, because of their accelerated healing, they are unable to be given painkillers, sedatives, or anesthetics, as their body's metabolism burns through them too quickly for them to have any effect. Likewise, even a highly concentrated drug or toxin will only affect them for a few seconds before completely wearing off.

In addition to potentially causing unforeseeable, damaging changes to the timeline, reckless travels through time can alert the Time Wraiths. These temporal guardians become instinctively drawn to the careless speedster, driven to capture the person who disturbed the timestream and draw the person into the Speed Force with it, although they often prioritize repeat offenders, as seen when the Time Wraiths captured Zoom for his violations of the Speed Force despite intending to punish Barry for creating a time remnant.
     Also, as seen when Barry created "Flashpoint", reckless alterations any speedster makes to the timeline can also affect the user's memory, gradually making even them forget how events originally were before they'd altered the timeline.
