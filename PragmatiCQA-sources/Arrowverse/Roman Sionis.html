   At some point, Roman became the CEO of
   Janus Cosmetics
   and had a daughter, named
   Circe
   . At some point after 2018, Circe was captured by
   Crows Security
   and incarcerated at
   Arkham Asylum
   .
   In mid-2020, Circe was killed in the fire of Arkham that was set by
   Alice
   .
   Roman blamed the first
   Batwoman
   as she was in Arkham during the fire.

   After the death of Roman's daughter,
   Circe Sionis
   , he founded and led the
   False Face Society
   gang in
   Gotham City
   to take revenge and destroy the system.
  </p>
  <p key="ea20ffab-32e0-4c3e-93cc-19c23d7e9bdc">
   The gang drew the attention of
   Crows Security
   by selling the drug
   Snakebite
   in Gotham; which led the Crows to discover that Black mask leads the gang.
  </p>
  <p key="e968d752-b896-473f-9330-869b8358fc30">
   Somehow, Roman got
   Kate Kane
   's body after her plane exploded and locked her in a cell. He visited her and said that
   her family
   declared her dead, but they would make them believe in life after death.
  </p>
  <p key="87737ed9-a72e-46b9-b26a-f321c93d34b4">
   Roman later ordered the False Face Society to kill Commissioner
   Forbes
   . The next morning, he gave an interview to
   Dana Dewitt
   regretting the situation.
  </p>
  <p key="8bd6172d-dcec-4bd4-943d-ad3fa82340cc">
   Roman ordered the gang to kill those involved in the murder, including a witness,
   Jordan Moore
   , but she was saved by
   Batwoman
   . He later ordered
   Angelique Martin
   to be captured, after learning that she wanted to leave the gang. In his hideout, he told Angelique that if she tried to leave the gang, she would die too.
  </p>
  <p key="da7c90e3-c458-4174-b4bd-c27baf048003">
   After Batwoman showed up to save Angelique, she was knocked out and tied up. On the other side, Black Mask told the guy who went after Jordan that he failed and was out, before killing him using a fist. Batwoman asked him what the hell he was doing, he said it was an "H.R. matter" and asked if she was a "OSHA" and she replied that she was after Angelique.
  </p>
  <p key="94115c15-e901-42bd-a558-12f1b21ef1a8">
   Roman asked who she thought he was, with her replying that he is a sadistic drug lord. He then says he understands why she thinks so, but he was only trying to get rid of the
   Crows
   and bat
   vigilantes
   , after they arrested and killed Circe. He said he didn't need her help and told his henchman to start the saw, but then
   Sophie Moore
   came in and he ran away.
  </p>
  <p key="a13e7459-7ed5-4bfc-8249-9cfc758dd9c3">
   Roman later hired
   Enigma

  <p key="89847f66-09b0-4400-8016-5e3b3d0c9ecb">
   Upon Black Mask's command, the killers of Commissioner Forbes were terminated to assure their silence.
  </p>
  <p key="55c13a01-2d67-43d5-8585-5dc88a82a2f9">
   A week later, Black Mask kills a gang member because the gang member was in charge of distribution and distribution was constantly being interrupted by Batwoman, who declared war on him on television. Black Mask made an example of him in front of other False Face members. He told the others that the supply of the drug is too low for them to allow anyone to disrupt the operation. One of the gang members reminded Black Mask that he had kept secret the formula to
   Snakebite
   except for the two chemists,
   Ocean
   and
   Angelique Martin
   , with one gone and the other in jail.
  </p>
  <p key="664c2b0f-73ec-4751-9e9f-d647caf17ce4">
   In his civilian identity, Roman went to
   Crows Headquarters
   and told
   Jacob Kane
   that he found a container of Snakebite that one of his employees had and wanted it destroyed properly. Jacob was more than willing to help the client.
  </p>
  <p key="9b00b378-5387-499f-802d-ca1c6f089349">
   When Angelique was being moved into witness protection, Black Mask sent gang members to kill her transport guards and to capture the chemist.
  </p>
  <p key="c4e985bf-2a2e-4e2c-9107-bea6c6a6cc3f">
   Black Mask had Angelique brought before him and threatened to have her burned with acid and chemicals if she did not agree to help by making more Snakebite. He then sent caravans of drivers with high-speed vehicles to get the ingredients necessary for the process. He gave his drivers burner phones and sent alternating routes to his warehouses through them. If the driver took too long to reach the site or took a route not directed, as he had a drone observing, the driver was considered "burned" and he would not accept the product. One
   driver
   was burned when she was captured by Batwoman, causing Black Mask a slight delay.
  </p>
  <p key="c70dd957-4d7e-4c67-b830-898be53ff274">
   Days later, Black Mask was at one of his warehouses when he found
   Sophie Moore
   lurking into his business; he captured her and had her bound. Just as he planned to kill her, Batwoman arrived and began a battle; Black Mask was able to hit the hero hard enough to make her mouth bleed. Knocking her down, he was about to shoot her but Sophie freed herself and injured him with a
   batarang
   ; the two took his gun and overwhelmed him. They asked for the whereabouts of Angelique so Black Mask showed them a display where Angelique was being held at gunpoint. The gang leader told his minion to shoot the chemist if he was not freed, causing Sophie and Batwoman to comply and allowing him to leave.
  </p>
  <p key="1fcc379e-fd4e-4f9a-8b23-965ab4b007f2">
   Black Mask went to where Angelique was making more Snakebite. He decided that the product needed to be tested and asked Angelique to try it, but she said that she was clean now and would not indulge. Thinking that she was being rebellious, Black Mask insisted, to the point of almost injecting her himself. Angelique begged him to stop and explained that she learned the formula of the drug through assisting Ocean and by observation, not formal training. Black Mask realized that the drug was unpredictable and could cause death, instead of euphoria, prompting him to need his master chemist.
  </p>
  <p key="1938d169-b021-4093-a7a8-147b4e074c42">
   After six weeks of therapy and hypnosis,
   Kate Kane
   has been transformed into a replica of
   Circe Sionis
   ; Black Mask removes his mask in front of
   Enigma
   so that Kate/Circe will not be confused and will know that "her father" is beside her. He tells "Circe" that she wears a mask because her face was burned in the fire at
   Arkham
   .
  </p>
  <p key="fee66d51-1621-4ee0-90a0-d702d310407c">
   Later, Black Mask has
   Ocean
   kidnapped and brought, with Angelique, to a warehouse so that they can make Snakebite; Black mask has a gang member video-record the process and tells the gang member to kill the chemists when they are finished. Soon afterwards, "Circe" brings
   Alice
   to the mansion because Alice assisted Batwoman in helping Ocean and Angelique escape the warehouse. Originally, Black Mask is annoyed and tells "Circe" to kill Alice, but, before "Circe" can give the kill-shot, Black Mask changes his mind, saying to his masked "daughter" that he has a job for Alice.

  <p key="106e781f-e9f2-443e-a3de-24a629bba9cc">
   Black Mask tortured Alice to discover the identity of the new Batwoman, but it failed, because she escaped confinement and tricked "Circe" into revealing Black Mask's civilian identity. Alice persuaded Roman not to kill her but to allow her to earn her life by making "Circe" a new face with Alice's "mask technology" and maintaining its composure.
   When Roman saw the face of "Circe" restored, he was overwhelmed with happiness and hugged "his daughter"; he rewarded Alice with her freedom, but promised to remove her tongue, if she revealed his secret identity or what she had done for him. Roman could not understand why Alice, who continually stared at "Circe", was hesitating to leave, so Roman asked two gang members to escort Alice out. Alice left, on her own.
  </p>
  <p key="73d87669-100a-4757-b69d-d6d3fe7328fb">
   Later, since Ocean and Angelique were not available, Roman hired a new chemist and allowed a blue version of Snakebite to be made.

   Roman later planned to reveal a new brand of make-up titled "Resurrection" as his official attempt to re-introduce his "daughter" back into high society. Upon her capture by Alice and Jacob, Roman had the False Face Society track them down. Roman was later with
   Safiyah Sohail
   when he informed her of "Circe"'s abduction, to which Sohail scolded him for; she subsequently revealed that Alice is Beth Kane, and that his "daughter" is her sister. Realising this, Roman later revealed Alice's identity to the public, causing Jacob to be arrested, and reunited with "Circe" after having her retrieved from the
   Bat Team
   .
  </p>
  <p key="f8e57e3e-563f-4ba2-acea-1133caaa8caa">
   Roman and Safiyah induced "Circe" to impersonate Kate and enter the

     After Roman's daughter,

     Roman is an extremely self-righteous-hypocrite; to the point of being delusional; for example, he claims that he is trying to change the corrupt legal system in

     Ultimately, Roman's arrogance and ego led to his downfall; at the hands of Beth Kane, as he (arrogantly) boasted to the latter that she failed at being a great villain stating that; "you cannot be both bad and have emotions", only for Beth to mock Roman and then used the Joker's
      acid flower
      to welded his mask onto his face to keep the former to from living a dual life by pretending to act as Gotham's savior; Roman then became horrified by the fact that his skull mask has been permanently welded onto his face.

     However, despite this, Roman is actually quite cowardly, as he willing to resort to "dirty" tactics in order to win; which was demonstrated during his first/only confrontation against Beth Kane and Ryan Wilder respectively, another example of his cowardly traits, is that when Ryan was about to unmask Roman (who was under the persona of Black Mask) he ordered one of his men to hold
      Angelique Martin
      at gunpoint; in order to force Ryan into allowing him to escape; proving just how much of a coward Roman truly is.
    </p>
    These negative traits of Roman's, are what eventually led to his deserved/justified incarceration.
