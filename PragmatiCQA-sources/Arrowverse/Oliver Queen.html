   Dave Hackett
   , dragging him into a life raft, the three of them being the only known survivors. Oliver tried to go back and look for Sara, but Robert told him it was too late, much to his devastation. After days of drifting at sea and running low on provisions, Robert realized that there was enough for maybe one person and chose to give his son a chance at survival. He revealed to Oliver that their family's wealth had been built on the suffering of others and he was not the man his son thought he was. Robert urged his son to right his wrongs and be better than he was. He then took out a gun and proceeded to shoot Hackett, much to Oliver's horror, before turning it on himself. Robert told Oliver once last time, "Survive" before shooting himself amidst his son's pleas.

   Oliver awoke some time later in Yao Fei's camp, where he tended to Oliver's wound. Later, when the man fell asleep, Oliver tried to flee, only to trigger a snare. Yao Fei soon arrived, cutting him down and leaving Oliver with a warning of the island's dangers. Oliver was left with no other choice but to follow him. Shortly after they left, trap which Oliver sprung unknowingly attracted the attention of a group of armed masked men, who examined it.

   Over the next few days, Oliver spent most of his time gazing at his picture of Laurel until Yeo Fei brought him a bird trapped in a cage. Oliver was confused, to which Yao Fei simply repeated, "Shēngcún", gesturing him to kill the bird if he wanted to eat. Horrified at the thought, Oliver refused at first but later, driven by hunger, he reluctantly broke the bird's neck. While eating, Yao Fei told Oliver that his mantra, "Shēngcún", means to survive. Yao Fei warned that Oliver would be forced to take more lives in the future, and advised him to forget about Laurel if he wanted to survive on the island.

   Oliver accompanied Yao Fei hunting one day. When Yao Fei killed a rabbit for dinner, Oliver refused to touch the body and tried to shoot with Yao Fei's bow as per his instructions. He managed to successfully launch an arrow but missed his intended target, a tree. Oliver then went to retrieve the arrow and dead rabbit, but was ambushed and captured by a group of armed men, who imprisoned him in an underground cage. Terrified, Oliver attempted to beg for his life, to no avail. They brought Oliver to their camp, where he was then interrogated by their leader,
   Edward Fyers
   . Fyers showed him a picture of Yao Fei, asking if Oliver had seen him, revealing the man's name as well as the island's;

   (meaning "purgatory" in Mandarin) Oliver denied any knowledge of Yao Fei in order to protect him. Not believing him, Fyers ordered an

   of his to extract information from Oliver.
  </p>
  <p key="d6c4bacd-b1da-47f4-8d33-b1ab51865c66">
   The man tortured Oliver by slicing his torso with a katana. Despite the pain, Oliver refused to divulge anything. After a period of time, Yao Fei barged in, rescuing a severely injured Oliver and bringing him back to the cave. He then left to lead Fyers' men away from their hideout, but not before telling Oliver to survive, and sealing the entrance to prevent Oliver from following him.
  </p>
  <p key="9b2d1786-6a72-4c92-abe5-45ebbf3529cf">
   Injured and alone in the cave, Oliver began began burning the pages of his father's book to keep a fire going. He suddenly experienced a hallucination of Robert telling him to survive despite Oliver's contemplating suicide, otherwise Robert's sacrifice would have been for nothing. After awakening, Oliver tore another page out of the book, but just as he was about to throw it onto the fire, the heat from the flames causes letters to appear on the paper. He proceeded to do the same with other pages, and various names began to appear on the pages. Oliver then promised the hallucination of his father that he would live up to this responsibility.

   Yao Fei returned a while later, bringing with him a captured Fyers. He told Oliver that Fyers had a plane that could take them off the island. They made their way through the woods until they were ambushed by Wintergreen and Fyers' men, with Fyers admitting how convenient it appeared to be that Yao Fei captured him so easily. Yao Fei told Oliver to run and began fighting the men. Unfortunately, he was defeated and knocked unconscious by Billy. From a safe distance, Oliver watched them take Yao Fei and then ran away.

  <p key="feb32d64-fc28-44c0-a42e-5994d2bb7ab2">
   One of Fyers' men continued to search for Oliver after Yao Fei was captured. Armed with only a knife, Oliver was eventually forced to confront him. The skirmish resulted in them tumbling and falling down into a stream. The soldier landed hard on a rock while Oliver ended up in the water. He managed to swim out and donned the uniform of the dead man, finding a set of keys and a map of the island in one of the pockets.
   Using the map, Oliver found his way to the camp where Fyers and his men were based. There, unfortunately accompanied by Fyers (who didn't seem to recognize him due to wearing a balaclava) he managed to make his way to where Yao Fei was being held prisoner, but once there, Fyers knocked down Oliver and put him in one of the cells.
  </p>
  <p key="b59304f8-4c6f-4b2c-b038-fb3825399495">
   When he came to, Fyers told him he'd known who he was because of his eyes, which tell everything about a person, which was the reason why his men all wore balaclavas. Fyers then rebuked Oliver for putting his trust in the wrong people, specifically Yao Fei. He motioned to the soldier next to him, who had been the first to talk to Oliver upon his arrival in the camp. The soldier took off his balaclava and revealed himself to be in fact Yao Fei, who had began working for Fyers.
   Yao Fei proceeded to seemingly kill Oliver in a fighting circle, however he secretly used a technique in order to fake Oliver's death. As he hit the water, Oliver was revived and swam to shore. In his pocket, he found a map with a route marked out. Oliver proceeded to follow the route, leading to an abandoned plane.
  </p>
  <p key="2f9928c6-fa90-4586-960a-dddc72cdaf43">
   Before he could do a thing, a man jumped down, threatening to kill him. Oliver told him that he was sent by Yao Fei, and the man seemed to drop his suspicions, introducing himself as

    Slade Wilson

   . Slade then told Oliver that there was an airfield, and he and Yao Fei had been observing it for months, that they were going to get off the island together. He then threw a sword to Oliver and told him of his belief that Yao Fei sent Oliver to him because he knew that he could not take the air field alone. Slade then challenged Oliver to a brief sword fight in order to gauge Oliver's fighting skills. He was unimpressed, significantly beating Oliver and told him how he fought much worse than a girl.
  </p>
  <p key="3294b61b-ace8-4199-9f9f-8a48b719ffce">
   Slade then knocked him out. Oliver woke, tied to a chair. Slade, in order to keep his location secret, decided to kill Oliver, however, Oliver managed to escape his bonds by breaking his hand, and then punched Slade in the face. Amused, Slade thought that there might have been a fighter inside of Oliver after all and decided to train Oliver instead. As Oliver went to choose a weapon, he found a bi-colored solid black and orange fabric mask, identical to the one worn by the man who had tortured him under Fyers' orders. When questioned about this, Slade explained that he and his old partner, and former friend, wore the same mask, that they had come to the island to rescue Yao as a mission from the
   Australian Secret Intelligence Service
   .
  </p>
  <p key="24694e22-ce7f-4480-82aa-ebea9174567f">
   The two progressively fought over an unspecified amount of time. Oliver almost gave up, though was quickly re-motivated by Slade. When the time came, the two of them made their way to Edward's camp, and ultimately the airstrip to a ride home. They set up camp, and Oliver tried to start a fire for several hours, before Slade pulled out a lighter and helped, bemused at Oliver's anger. In return, Slade reminisced about his and his partner, Billy Wintergreen's, arrival on the island.
  </p>
  <p key="3d4034f9-98e5-4fa3-a7aa-60ca262e39ed">
   A day or so later, Oliver accidentally stepped on a land mine left over from a previous war. Slade ran to hide as a group of soldiers approached a masked Oliver. Oliver explained his situation, as Slade had deserted him, and they surveyed the mine. Suddenly, Slade jumped from his hiding spot, slicing through the soldiers with his sword, replacing Oliver with one of them. They continued towards the camp, finally reaching it at dark. Oliver, aided by Slade's sniping, raced stealthily to the communications tower. He attempted to quietly take out the only man in there, only resulting in having a gun pointed at his face. He tried to remove it, but his technique failed. Luckily, Slade reached him just in time, stabbing the man through the gut. They were able to contact the plane, allowing it clearance to land.
  </p>
  <p key="d3d1e270-1ab4-47a8-9c69-228c53178987">
   Slade left Oliver on his own and Oliver, seeing his chance, grabbed a phone and called Laurel, hoping to make up for his wrongdoings. Before he could speak, Slade returned and stopped him, reminding him that it could be monitored. After a short argument, Oliver went to find Yao Fei and rescue him. Yao Fei explained that he was only staying for a person. Fyers and Wintergreen entered the tent, leading Yao Fei to knock out Oliver. When Oliver came to, he was forced into the middle of a circle. After questioning Fyers, he discovered that he meant for Wintergreen to kill him.
  </p>
  <p key="4ac87e72-d644-4975-90ad-cf7bbfa0e0f8">
   Before this could happen, Slade caused a distraction so that he could snipe several soldiers and Oliver could run to safety. Oliver watched as Slade and Wintergreen faced off, with Slade overpowering his former friend. As they were leaving, Slade was shot. Oliver helped to protect them as they left, finally knocking out his first soldier with the move Slade had shown him earlier. When they reached Slade's plane, Oliver helped remove the bullet in Slade's arm. He then joked that his only friend on the island was named "Wilson".
  </p>
  <p key="1a99e2d2-df92-43f7-b8d9-b4ac9056a77d">
   Later, Oliver checked Slade's wound and found that it was infected. He recalled the herbs that Yao Fei had given him that prevented infection from his arrow wound and offered to go get them. Slade said that he wouldn't last an hour out there, and Oliver believed that he could get them in 45 minutes. He then went to Yao Fei's cave, discovering a man tied up there. The man explains that he was the only survivor of a shipwreck, like Oliver, and had discovered Fyers' soldiers, whom had beaten and taken him to the cave. Oliver, believing it to be a trap, grabbed the herbs and left the man there, returning to Slade with the herbs.
   Oliver began working on a broken down radio transmitter to find a way to get off the island with Slade.
  </p>
  <p key="b7598260-5ccb-4fbd-8a9b-fe21314b465c">
   After working on it for a while, they were able to hear conversations between radios, but unable to communicate back. After listening for a while, the two learned that Fyers had ordered the shipment of a missile launcher big enough to destroy an entire army.
   Oliver and Slade were able to sneak in to Fyers' compound, where they stole the launcher's ignition chip. They called Fyers on his radio and told him that they would return the chip in exchange for a way off of the island.
  </p>
  <p key="368e96c8-24f5-471d-97a8-f5ed749ce257">
   Oliver and Slade soon met with Fyers, who quickly backed down from their deal by revealing to them that he would kill

Oliver and Slade escaped with Shado in tow, but soon learned that Fyers' men had found the chip while they had rendezvoused with Fyers, and had taken it back. Shado then told them how she knew of Fyers' plan.
   Shado decided to begin teaching Oliver archery so that he could help them defeat Fyers. She proceeded to get him to fill a bowl with water, and then continuously slap it.
  </p>
  <p key="0440c0c6-1fa8-44b4-b219-82bf42bdd024">
   After a while, Oliver became frustrated and asked Shado the purpose of the exercise, and she showed him that because he had spent so long slapping the water, he then had the strength in his hands to pull back a bow.
   She then told him that he had to learn how to shoot, during which the two grew closer romantically despite Oliver confessing that he was in love with Laurel despite it being complicated to Shado. After learning how to shoot, the three were shocked to see Yao Fei arrive at their compound. However, he was promptly forced to reveal that he had brought Fyers' soldiers along with him.
  </p>
  <p key="1bfbd70f-dd3b-4845-8e6e-23e9e93b859e">
   The soldiers brought the three of them to Fyers' compound, where Oliver saw that one of the soldiers was the young man who he had met in the cave who had claimed to be trapped there. Fyers revealed that the reason he was on the island was because he and his men were hired to shoot down a Ferris Aircraft on its way to China, thus destroying China's economy. Fyers then threatened to kill Shado if Yao Fei did not film a video taking responsibility for the terrorist attack. After reluctance, Yao Fei agreed, but subtly handed Oliver a knife. After filming the video, Fyers shot Yao Fei in the head, killing him. Just as Fyers and his men prepared to fire the missile, Oliver cut himself free using Yao Fei's knife, and he, Slade, and Shado, fought Fyers and his men. Fyers, however, was able to get the missile fired at the plane, and Oliver and Shado went to manually redirect the missile while Slade covered them.

  <p key="9cb4adc1-20b5-4ec1-a12e-275d43da0bf6">
   Just as Shado was about to place the chip inside the switchboard, she was attacked from behind, and Oliver managed to redirect the missile, which hit Fyers' compound instead, with both Slade and Shado still there. Oliver went to search for them, and found Slade alive, but then turned around to see that Fyers was still alive and had Shado in his custody. Oliver found Yao Fei's wooden compound bow and arrow, and pointed it at Fyers, who mused about how his meticulously-executed plan over the past two years was undone by a shipwrecked boy, and admitted that he would've gotten him off of the island if Oliver had stopped messing with Fyers' plans. Before Fyers could make a move, Oliver shot an arrow at his throat, killing him.

   Months later, Oliver had noticeably improved in his combat tactics, as noted by both Slade and Shado. The three of them soon discovered another group of people on the island, and went to track them down. However, Shado was soon abducted by the group, forcing Oliver and Slade to try and rescue her. They soon found her being interrogated by a group of pirates, who were asking her where to find "bodies." Slade told Oliver to wait for his signal to attack, but Oliver, unable to watch Shado be tortured, attacked them impulsively. While Slade fended off the other pirates, Oliver brutally murdered their leader out of rage, shocking both Slade and Shado.

   Slade promptly suggested Shado talk to Oliver, worried that he would lose his mind. This leads to the latter two making love, to the clear annoyance of Slade, who told Oliver that Shado was simply a distraction that would lead to his death. The three of them soon found a cave with skeletal remains of Japanese soldiers from World War II,
   determining that they were the very same bodies that the pirates were looking for. They also deduced that more people were likely to follow, and so they took one of the bodies back to the plane. As Shado examined the body, Slade and Oliver went to find a strategic point to watch from, if more pirates were to appear.

  <p key="66e22d78-ace9-4b82-b6b8-9568da034284">
   Slade emphasized his point about Shado, though Oliver ignored him. When finally the two reached the top of a mountain, they discovered that the pirates had come from a large ship just off the coast of Lian Yu. They soon spotted a number of missiles coming from the ship, clearly aimed for their compound. Oliver and Slade raced back to the plane, however as soon as they approached, they were both knocked out by the explosion of missiles. Oliver quickly saw Slade some distance off with his hands and face on fire, then fainted.

  <p key="20cf2db5-763d-48d8-ac72-e0d0819ce750">
   Oliver woke up sometime later, imprisoned in a cell, surrounded by several other people.
   As he awoke, Oliver was approached by the surviving pirate that interrogated Shado.
   The man
   asked him who his friends were and whether any of them knew the location of the graves. Refusing to answer, the man gave him two options: he could give him answers, or he could be tortured, though both would ultimately end in death. Oliver obstinately refuses to reveal anything, and the man shot him in the stomach. Oliver was soon given tools and medicinal tools to remove the bullet. Oliver was prompted to ask a nearby prisoner, later revealed as
   <a href="Anatoly Knyazev.html" key="4caef9ff-b566-4edc-9a52-571ada0dc253" title="Anatoly Knyazev">

   , as to why the incident occurred. He explained that it was to see if he was strong enough to survive, and showed a scar from the identical injury.
  </p>
  <p key="d67d36d6-dcc9-4fb1-b149-99bed8425cc4">
   Oliver eventually removed the bullet, to immense pain, and the pirate soon came back to find Oliver surviving. "The Captain" asked him again if he knew of the location of the Japanese bodies and although Oliver didn't say a word, the Captain inferred that they were in fact on the correct island. Later, the crew brought Oliver out of his cell, being told that his days of screaming had just begun. He was thrown in to a room, followed through the opposite door by a woman. Oliver sees that, much to his shock, the woman is
   <a href="Sara Lance.html" key="0f3cf405-ca49-4c77-8544-76554f2039ac" title="Sara Lance">

   , somehow having also survived their shipwreck.
  </p>
  <p key="e51be9d4-775b-493a-8a04-dc08b984e86c">
   Oliver, surprised to see Sara alive, tried talking to her, but she quickly kicked him in the stomach, claiming that "prisoners don't speak." A man entered the room, introducing himself as
   Ivo
   , and asked for Oliver's name in return. Sara signaled to Oliver not to give his real name, so Oliver began to lie, firstly stating that his name was Tommy and secondly that he was the only survivor of a shipwreck that occurred near the island. When Ivo asked if he had come by a Japanese submarine while exploring the island, Oliver informed him that he hadn't. Ivo then revealed that during World War II, the Japanese created a serum called "
   <a href="Mirakuru.html" key="1d32c31d-d254-4cd6-a0bc-c5ebf9358907" title="Mirakuru">
    Mirakuru
   </a>
   " that increased the physical strength and allowed rapid cell regeneration in humans. He explained that the serum was transported via a submarine that came under heavy fire, running aground somewhere in the chain of islands containing Lian Yu, and it was finally thanks to Oliver that they knew it was Lian Yu itself. Oliver angrily told Ivo that he'd killed Oliver's friends, and Ivo replied, telling him that due to his friends being dead, it was up to Oliver to help Ivo find the sub. Later, Sara came to visit Oliver in his cell, advising him not to reveal their knowing each other, otherwise they would both be killed.
  </p>
  <p key="c60e3af4-fc3e-425a-90f0-4a79fa8d94e3">
   Oliver wished to warn his friends, believing them to still be alive, so later that night, Sara unlocked Oliver's cell, telling him to follow her. As he left, the prisoner he previously talked to asked him to not forget about them, followed by Oliver promising that he would return. Sara brought him to a room with a radio transmitter inside it and showed him that she could operate it. Oliver called for his friends and Shado answered, but before he could reveal his location, Sara disconnected the radio. Ivo and the Captain entered the room, with Ivo revealing that Oliver has confirmed that his friends were alive, and thus still a threat, for which they would be killed. The Captain believed Oliver to be of no more use and pointed a gun towards his head. However, Sara interjected, stating that Oliver could still be useful. Ivo agreed, telling Oliver that he would be going back to the island and calling him by name, revealing that Sara had seemingly been manipulating him the whole time.
  </p>
  <p key="7495e569-0a97-45ea-96c5-4f87165a222b">
   Oliver was soon take back to the island and led to the plane wreck, where the Captain laid charges to blow up the compound. However, Shado was successfully able to diffuse the detonator in time, initially unbeknownst to them. As they reached the grave site of the Japanese soldiers, Ivo questioned Oliver about the
   hōzen
   he had previously found at the site. Oliver didn't reply, causing Ivo to get angry and send him outside to be tortured. As the captain was about to torture him, Shado and Slade appeared to save Oliver, shooting one of the men and grabbing Sara and Oliver before running away from Ivo and his men. Once they were a good distance away from Ivo, they stopped and Oliver mentioned the hōzen, which Shado kept as a pendant because it reminded her of her father. They realized that the etchings on one side of the hōzen were coordinates to the shipwrecked submarine, where the Mirakuru serum was being kept. When Sara explained that the serum could save the human race, Oliver asked her whether it could Slade, who was slowly dying due to his collective injuries from the previous missile explosions.
  </p>
  <p key="082581a8-de83-471c-8a53-8cae44d6bf21">
   Presumably agreeing that the serum could save Slade, the four of them began to trek through the island towards the inscribed coordinates. During their journey, Shado questioned Oliver on how he knew Sara and he admitted that she was

   </a>
   's sister. Dismayed at his response, Shado began to distance herself from him. They eventually found the submarine and entered it, leaving a weakened Slade near the entrance to find the serum. When they did, Sara revealed that they needed to give Slade a sedative before injecting him with the serum, but another scan of the area revealed that there were no sedatives in the sub.
  </p>
  <p key="1922314e-11f4-46fd-b4ab-b9339ef6c00a">
   Oliver made the decision to use the serum on Slade anyway, and before he was injected, Slade revealed that he had been in love with Shado the whole time she and Oliver were together. That said, Oliver gave him the serum, and he, Shado and Sara were horrified when it only seemed to kill him faster. Before they could begin to mourn Slade, Ivo and his men arrived, taking the three of them captive.
   Once they collected the serum, Ivo had his men take them back up to the island, where Sara played on Ivo's affection for her to cajole him into letting Oliver and Shado go.
  </p>
  <p key="aba25be1-9d16-4e18-8ed2-cd55d7a335eb">
   But while Ivo admitted that he cared about her, he forced Oliver at gunpoint to choose who he wanted to live more, Sara or Shado. Given thirty seconds, Oliver tried to get Ivo to leave them alone but was forced to kneel behind Sara when Ivo moved to shoot her. Taking this as Oliver's decision, Ivo shoots Shado, causing Oliver to be overcome with shock and guilt. Slade suddenly appeared, attacking everyone standing. Ivo ran off, leaving his men to die, and when Slade discovered Shado's body and asked why she died, Sara lied because of Oliver and said that Ivo shot her without reason.
  </p>
  <p key="6ccd0db2-03c0-4d9a-abff-e6865611c1a6">
   Oliver, Slade and Sara later buried Shado next to Yao Fei and Robert Queen. During her funeral, Oliver stated his hope that she was with her father. Slade gave Oliver Shado's green hood, and initially he did not want it, but kept it after being reminded by Slade of their relationship prior to her death. Later as they were walking, Oliver was close to telling Slade the true reason why Shado was killed, when Sara approached him, advising him not to, as Slade still had Mirakuru in him, and they had no idea as to the effects of it. They asked Slade where they were headed and he responded that they were heading back to the plane, in order to get geared up before they killed Ivo and his men. Before Oliver could stop him from continuing his plan of killing Ivo, Slade lifted Oliver a foot off the ground, choking him. Sara promptly hit Slade with a branch, making him let go of Oliver and causing him to realize what he'd done. Oliver simply assumed that that the Mirakuru was messing with his head.
  </p>
  <p key="e39b42d9-5df3-4f94-99a7-45762a110594">
   Later that night, Ivo contacted them through a radio, telling them they had ten days to deliver the Mirakuru to him, in turn giving them safe passage off of the island. They turned to consult with Slade, only to realize that he had disappeared.
   After a number of heart-to-heart conversations, Oliver and Sara made their way to the cave that they’d found the Japanese soldiers in. Slade was nowhere to be found, though Oliver spotted some calculations on a wall. He recognized them, telling Sara how he'd seen identical calculations on Edward Fyers' missile launcher. Oliver therefore deduced that Slade was going to destroy the
   <i key="91101bce-5f08-4ffc-89b0-53d60fd1298f">

   with the missiles. The two rushed to the missile launchers as quick as they could and found Slade inputting the calculations.
  </p>
  <p key="34405298-d3dd-4ac6-aa0e-2857f605c94b">
   Oliver attempted to stop Slade, however he threatened to shoot him if he got in the way. Before he could, Oliver admitted that Shado had indeed loved Slade, perhaps not romantically but indeed platonically, and would have wanted him to return home. Knowing this, Slade decided not to fire, so as to not let Shado die in vain, and Oliver reassured him that he would help his friend along the difficult road.
  </p>
  <p key="16b713c0-770b-4d1e-b4d6-a2ad1cc3b194">
   Once Slade had got his senses back, the three of them surveyed the freighter and brainstormed ideas on how to board it. As they were talking they heard a plane. When it came in to sight they began to make noise to signal it, though it was quickly shot down with a missile. They ran to find it and discovered its dying pilot. Sara suggested Oliver get medical supplies from their compound and so he and Slade went back to retrieve some, but they returned too late to save the man. In the midst of this, however, Oliver noticed a bagged parachute, remarking how it could get them on to the freighter.
   For some time, Oliver trained around the forest, improving his archery and various strengths, progressively getting much better as time went by.
  </p>
  <p key="9bb65b3c-b8dc-42d0-a6ea-8a039f2b5436">
   Slade commended Oliver on his skills, though Oliver reminded him that trees were nothing compared to live enemies. He later discussed plans to attack the ship, while Sara concocted some cocculus indicus, to counteract sodium pentathol, which Sara assumed Ivo would use on Oliver. Outside, Oliver suggested destroying the Mirakuru, to which Slade overheard and agreed. While burning it, Sara explained that Oliver had to be the one to kill Ivo, not Slade, so there were no repercussions. Later that night, Slade produced some alcohol for the three of them, one of the few things that survived the plane's crash, and they drank to respective things. Oliver asked for Sara to reassure his mother of his moral changes, should he have died the following day, and she agreed. Slade suggested they get some rest and Oliver soon went to sleep. Through the night, Oliver had nightmares.
  </p>
  <p key="2dfda7d0-8bfc-45b7-8fb1-a3b7508ecebf">
   He woke up to Sara and Slade ready to go and donned Shado's old hood. They trekked to a hill on the shoreline and Oliver prepared to shoot a flaming arrow at a bonfire they’d built. He initially failed the first time but hit it point blank the second. Slade remarked that they were leaving the island as brothers (in contrast to them meeting as strangers) and Oliver bid him farewell. Down on the shore, two of Ivo's men spotted Oliver. He began to run along the beach, only to trip over a tree root and be captured by the men. On the ship, Oliver was placed back into a cell. He began talking to a man who introduced himself as Thomas Flynn. Not long after, Ivo summoned Oliver to his room. Refusing to answer Ivo's questions, Oliver was injected with sodium pentathol or truth serum. Seemingly dazed, Oliver began to answer Ivo's questions and apparently reveal their entire plan.
  </p>
  <p key="effa7725-2963-42f8-acc7-10b16ac140a6">
   He was taken back to his cell, but along the way he knocked the guards out and took their keys. Oliver rendezvoused with Sara and Slade outside and was given his bow and arrows. They let the prisoners go and Oliver made his way to Ivo. Aiming an arrow at him, Oliver blamed Ivo for Shado's death. Ivo tried to explain how it was, in fact, Oliver's fault. When Oliver finally admitted his feelings of guilt, he threatened to kill Ivo, however, Ivo alerted him to Slade's presence in the room, and he turned to face a horrified Slade. Oliver finally admitted to Shado's death being his fault and Slade began to fight him, letting Ivo escape. Before Slade could choke him to death, there was an explosion that sent Slade flying. Oliver took the chance to run, jumping off the side of the ship just after Anatoly, Thomas and Sara, only to be grabbed by the ankle by Slade. Slade then put him in a cell, announcing that he was the new captain of the

  <p key="973480e4-0f4e-4e24-a61c-a59af19d7836">
   Later, Slade ordered Oliver to be brought out. He gave Ivo a gun, asking him to kill Oliver just as he had killed Shado. When he did not do it straight away, Slade sliced his arm off. Ivo was taken away, and Slade claimed that he would not let Oliver die until he had known complete despair, as Slade had, reassuring and promising him that it would eventually come.
  </p>
  <p key="7ec0ec61-5c83-4bf0-af4d-7fb467be28da">
   While in custody, Slade had Oliver severely tortured by the ship's crew, zapping him with electricity before finally branding him with the same tattoo that Shado had.
   Later as part of an exchange deal between Slade and Sara, Oliver was returned to the island with Ivo in exchange for Hendrick, a former cellmate of Oliver's. Oliver intervened when Slade aimed his gun at Sara, and Slade predicted that they would spend the rest of their life on the island, before leaving. As he left, he threatened that once he had the ship moving, he would go to make Oliver's family suffer.
  </p>
  <p key="843666cf-dd7f-4212-98c6-831841f0416c">
   A little while after, Oliver was being attended to by Sara for his heavily damaged eye, after being punched by Slade. Anatoly attempted to torture Anthony Ivo, only to be stopped before he could. Ivo proceeded to tell Oliver that there was, in fact, a cure to the Mirakuru, a possible way to stop Slade. Ivo offered to help them find it if they could provide him with a quick death due to the gangrene traveling in his system due to his arm stump. They agreed to the deal and after being told where the cure was, Oliver shot Ivo, as a way to protect Sara from having to be the one to do it.
   Anatoly,
   Peter
   (another former prisoner), Sara and Oliver all returned to the Japanese submarine.
  </p>
  <p key="33424b61-bc89-47f0-b45f-1eb4f8cec7c3">
   Oliver suggested to Anatoly that he pilot the submarine, having been in the Russian Navy, and he reluctantly agreed. When they tried, they were unable to get away. Oliver suggested they blast their way out, so Anatoly retrieved blueprints for the ship's torpedoes. However, it became apparent that the torpedoes could only be directed by someone in there with them, therefore whoever directed it would die. Peter was quick to volunteer, pointing out that he had inevitably fatal radiation poisoning, and it was a generally heroic action as he would be saving a number of lives. Anatoly soon directed Peter as to what would be happening while Oliver instructed Sara to wait outside for his call.
  </p>
  <p key="7c21f696-93c8-4fda-864e-4206dda9095c">
   Oliver came to talk with Peter before he prepared himself, and Peter remarked that he believed Oliver would be particularly compassionate one day. The two shook hands and Peter got into the torpedo hole. After Sara was clear, they fired the torpedo. As it directed back and hit the submarine, the two were knocked off their feet. Oliver was able to stand back up, moving the submarine around.

  <p key="8d039ce5-870b-4150-8292-8942ded25a8e">
   Successful, Oliver proceeded to notify Sara, only for her to desperately shout his name through the radio.
   Oliver went above the submarine to find Sara and returned with her walkie talkie, concluding that Slade's men had taken her. Anatoly mentioned that he'd seen the

Oliver requested that he fire it at the Amazo if he and Sara were not back within an hour, much to the shock of Anatoly.
  </p>
  <p key="5719a299-248f-479b-988f-750e7e765ece">
   When they got close, Oliver and Anatoly said farewell to each other, the latter remarking that the former had made a lifelong friend, warranting any favors happily given. They hugged, Anatoly promising he'd teach Oliver Russian, and Oliver hurried up the ladder and out towards the

   Before Oliver could go for the Mirakuru cure, they were ambushed by Slade who revealed that he had the cure.
   Slade took Oliver and Sara to watch him inject numerous prisoners with Mirakuru, though it had clearly failed on several already. Oliver tried to reason with Slade, stating how Shado would have wanted them both to survive and return home. Before Slade could shoot Oliver, Anatoly fired the torpedo at the

   The two started to fight and soon Slade was able to lift up Oliver by choking him. Oliver took off Slade's mask, but Slade simply knocked him down. As Oliver stood up, they started to run at each other, but they were knocked off balance and large bits of debris fell on to Slade, trapping him. Being given a choice between curing or killing, Oliver decided to kill Slade by stabbing an arrow through his eye. A further explosion knocked Oliver over. A day or two later, Oliver awoke in a bed. Two men in suits ordered him to follow them, and once outside Oliver was greeted by

Maseo told Oliver that Tommy needed to be "off the board" as Waller couldn't risk Tommy flashing his picture all over the place. Oliver would suggest to Maseo that they could find a Tommy Merlyn look-a-like at a local morgue but Maseo reasoned that it would be easier winning the lottery and paying Waller off.

Days later, Oliver was tasked to kill a "terrorist" which Oliver believed didn't look like one. Maseo told Oliver that those were the best terrorists and ordered Oliver to proceed to kill him. Oliver proceeded to kill the man in the open though and due to the crowd, it went unnoticed, as Oliver retrieved a USB which Waller required to be acquired.

   At Maseo's home, Oliver questioned what it was needed for, though Maseo refused to answer. While Maseo was busy, Oliver convinced Akio to lend the laptop, to which Oliver plugged in the USB and learned the man he was sent to kill was Edward Fyers' handler. Oliver requested a meeting with Waller as he realized she was the true perpetrator behind the attempted shooting of the Ferris air jet. Oliver learned from Waller that the true reason why she wanted the plane shot down was to eliminate Chien Na Wei, as it was their only opportunity. Sometime later Oliver and Maseo waited in a street for an hour (after having also circled the block five times) Maseo updated Oliver as to who their target was, telling him that he only needed to get information and not kill him. They spotted the man and Oliver attempted to inconspicuously follow him. However, the man was able to knock him down as he ran off.

He reasoned that Oliver mightn't consciously remember, but likely still saw him stash it. They headed back to Maseo's apartment, where

   He pointed the bow and arrow at Chang, though he suggested correctly that Oliver wasn't keen on actually torturing a man. In wasting this time, a massive explosion occurred in the city, which Oliver witnessed. Angered, Waller lectured Oliver, reasoning that extreme people could only be dealt with using extreme measures, therefore he should have just shot an arrow instead of waiting. Allowing him to make an attempt at redemption, Waller brought him Li Khuan Hui, asking him to torture him for details on
   Chien Na Wei
   's agenda in Hong Kong. Waller left, allowing Oliver to get ready his bow.

   Oliver returned to Maseo's apartment after his torture of Li Khuan Hui. He was handed food but claimed to have no appetite. He revealed what he'd learned from his torture, that a biotechnology company had created a super-virus,
   Omega
   when initially attempting to create a super-antibiotic, and that one vial could wipe out an entire city. Following that, the two men headed to the initial company,
   BTHK Biotech
   . Maseo headed off to watch the security footage.
  </p>
  <p key="6adfa2fe-f351-48cf-85ed-bbe4bcd77b46">
   Unable to find any vials of it, Oliver told Maseo, who checked recent footage, finding a scientist from the inside who'd stolen it for Chien Na Wei. They found the man, who claimed to have absolutely no knowledge of what they were talking about. Getting no answers, Oliver threatened him with a bow and arrow. After much torture, they were confused as to how he would not confess. Maseo finally suggested that he was perhaps under the influence of a hypnotic drug called
   Vitura
   . They decided that as they had Chien's "inside man," their biggest problem could have been her finding them. They returned to Maseo's apartment, finding blood on some paper and Akio, claiming that the "white-haired woman" had taken Tatsu.
  </p>
  <p key="f18ad04a-c5de-4cba-94d8-d5089eaa2aec">
   Oliver and Maseo took their concerns to Waller who told them of the second half other the virus,
   Alpha
   , and ordered Oliver and Maseo to retrieve it, and was noticeably unconcerned with Tatsu's disappearance. On the rooftop of the nearby building, Maseo compromised the glass and Oliver attempted to grapple by arrow into the building. However, he got stuck and almost fell to his death, before eventually getting in. Once in, he, Maseo and other agents engaged the Triad but Oliver used this chance to discreetly plant a tracker on one of them and let him get away. Oliver later explained his reasoning to Maseo, wishing to have the man lead him to Maseo's wife.
  </p>
  <p key="e9cbe28a-f133-4a08-a9a7-05f553f63645">
   Maseo expressed his gratitude and told him he would forever be in his debt. The Yamashiro's decided to go to Shanghai, to escape from China White. As Oliver made his attempts to call home, Amanda's men capture him and tortured him to uncover Maseo's location. Later on, Maseo is captured and revealed that being captured was his plan all along, and him going to Shanghai was a lie. The two are then knocked out cold. They later wake up in a car where Amanda revealed China White has fled Hong Kong. Oliver was then shocked to find himself back home in Starling City, where they had tracked Chien Na Wei.

  <p key="51c71753-a933-4d48-be6d-2e6c23110126">
   Oliver was briefed, learning that an executive was in town, Peter Khang, a man who worked for

    Queen Consolidated

   . Oliver recognized Khang because he'd been over at the Queen's household for
   Christmas
   . Waller gave Oliver strict orders not to make any contact with family or friends, or she would kill them off. Oliver began to keep a watchful eye over Thea from a distance, learning Thea had begun a drug addiction, much to his dismay.

   That night, Oliver snuck into his family's company, hacking into Peter Khang's computer. Oliver then found files from his father that were intended for him and his sister. As he was uploading the files to the computer,

   walked in, though Oliver managed to hide in time. While Maseo and Waller were tracking down the location of the OMEGA auction, Oliver snuck off to Tommy's party. After watching
   Jordan Kern
   selling drugs to his sister once again, he approached him, threatening him to stay away from Thea. When Jordan noticed his identity, Oliver shoved him and told him to stay away once again. Jordan pulled a knife, though Oliver snapped his neck and threw him off the balcony. Maseo then found Oliver and told him they found the location of the auction. Oliver told Maseo he needs to return home and fix what's broken since he left. Maseo reminded Oliver that thousands could die if they don't stop the auction but Oliver told Maseo he doesn't care for those people.
  </p>
  <p key="224ea9e3-94ed-43eb-836b-1a5306aba494">
   Oliver returned home, though no one was there. Oliver used a tablet to view the file sent to him. He listened to his father's message to him, a similar one that his father gave him before he committed suicide. Motivating, him, Oliver came to assist Maseo in stopping the auction. The following day, Oliver thanked Waller for the ride home, though to his disappointment, General
   Matthew Shrieve
   required him to be debriefed back in Hong Kong. After Oliver explained several times what happened, Matthew released Oliver, Maseo and his family from A.R.G.U.S and let them go anywhere in the world. As Oliver, Maseo and his family walked to the boat, an engineer walked by and began shooting at Oliver, Maseo and his family. Oliver, confused, ran to cover along with Maseo and his family. Maseo debunked that Waller didn't like General Matthew's decision, and it would be better if she had them killed. While running to the boat, Maseo told Oliver to take Akio and run, while Maseo protected his wife.

  <p key="3c4f9ecc-daf0-4d79-9e86-0f31e6a96b63">
   Oliver took Akio and ran. While on the run from Waller's men, Oliver and Akio ran into
   Mei

  </p>
  <p key="865009e5-3112-45aa-aee6-48233058e6d6">
   Oliver requested her help as she hid them in her house. Oliver lied that his name was Tommy, and he knew Shado in medical school. However, his lies were revealed as Mei saw Oliver's dragon tattoo on his back, the same tattoo Shado had. Before Oliver is given the chance to explain, Waller's men began shooting. The men stormed in, but Masao and Tatsu arrived in time to take down the remaining men. Oliver then revealed Shado and Yao Fei's fate to Mei, and she thanked him for telling her the truth. Still, on the run from A.R.G.U.S., Maseo had them all stay at a run-down residence with an acquaintance, Li Ling who was in debt to them. While Waller's men were looking for them all over Hong Kong, Maseo told Oliver they'd be found even if they'd left the city.
  </p>
  <p key="50940a7d-f4ef-49df-9304-afe86147cffa">
   Oliver decided to "find Waller first." He infiltrated the main field office with Maseo's pass-card to the main office. He was then cornered by a man who was shot from behind by an injured Waller. She informed Oliver that she'd been usurped, and had been kept hostage there for weeks. She dropped her gun, allowing herself to be held at gunpoint by Oliver. She then told Oliver it was general Shrieve who targeted them for death, not her and that he planned to distribute and unleash the
   Alpha-Omega bioweapon
   all over Hong Kong; as he believed China to be an economic threat and pin it on the Triad. He also learned from her his men developed a vaccine so he and his men don't die along with all of Hong Kong. She warned him to run, to get as far away from Hong Kong as he can. He later returned to the Yamashiros and conversed with them.
  </p>
  <p key="dead4f82-79fb-4958-a9c6-5edcdeba8fe2">
   Maseo warned them Shrieve had Waller's resources and his contacts said he had men all over Hong Kong. Oliver proposed they steal some of the vaccines. They broke into a supposed army base and successfully found the vaccine and manage to make it out. Oliver also stole a phone which was revealed to have plans for how the virus was going to be distributed.
  </p>
  <p key="c62cfe87-5ade-4f53-8277-051b3350af5f">
   After the three of them and Akio were all inoculated, Oliver decided he would stop the virus from spreading. He told Maseo and Tatsu to take Akio and get out of Hong Kong. Tatsu replied that she and Maseo would help him. Oliver protested, but she replied that he needs to learn to let people help him. Oliver, Maseo, and Tatsu later located General Shrieve and his men. They looked on as the Alpha and Omega components were mixed and the virus armed. Oliver also noted a food cart was at the scene, thinking they were having dinner. They followed a truck supposedly carrying the virus leaving the area in a car Oliver "borrowed."
  </p>
  <p key="1f22b0cc-c7af-41cc-a18a-0d0bd8e30eaa">
   Down the road, they were spotted and a gunfight ensued. Oliver and Tatsu managed to commandeer the truck and searched it but the virus wasn't there. Tatsu interrogated a soldier for the virus' actual whereabouts. He replied the virus was actually in the food cart seen earlier. They tracked down the cart and another firefight ensued. While Maseo and Tatsu dispatched the rest of the soldiers, Oliver managed to snatch the vial containing the bioweapon but he was engaged in combat with the soldier handing the phial out, and in the struggle, the phial fell through the air and shattered over the ground and the bioweapon was released. Very little time later, multiple civilians were already immediately infected, dying and a public announcement was made.
  </p>
  <p key="1bcf8ada-23a0-450f-868b-d51edd82a55a">
   Oliver was guilt-ridden as he'd had the phial in his hand, but Maseo told him it wasn't his fault, it was that of General Shrieve. After Tatsu says she couldn't get through to Li Ling who was watching Akio, they decided to regroup and head back. In the later morning, they came across an Army truck that was supposedly handing out a cure for the supposed chemical attack, but the three of them figured out what was actually being handed out was the virus.
  </p>
  <p key="d2b78c4a-166c-49cd-a36a-90f3e273d67f">
   Oliver walked up to the van, firing off his gun, scaring off the crowd, the three of them dispatched the soldiers and Oliver angrily stated "all of it" destroyed. Setting off a bomb, the truck imploded supposedly destroying all of the bioweapon. However, unbeknownst to Oliver, Maseo had secretly stole a sample intending to use it on Shrieve for revenge. They immediately ran back to Li Ling's apartment, and gathered Akio but Li Ling was found dead from the virus. Oliver told them both that the chaos will give them cover from general Shrieve, so they decided to leave Hong Kong. After hotwiring a car, they began to set off, unfortunately, Akio was bleeding from his mouth and was feverish - he'd been infected. Later on in the day, Oliver and the Yamashiros had arrived at a pharmacy to find something to help Akio. Maseo had surmised that Akio's immune system wasn't strong enough for the vaccine due to his young age. Out of desperation, he surmised that maybe Shrieve and his men had made a cure, but he had to try. Oliver decided to come along with him.
  </p>
  <p key="45cc9f92-1533-4a52-aad7-55862f8104b2">
   Oliver managed to locate a "rogue Army base" and the both of them stormed through the base, killing their way through to General Shrieve. Maseo shot him in the shoulder. Shrieve relented pointing to a safe, but the cure had to be administered subcutaneously. Oliver roughed Shrieve saying he was coming with them to administer it. With Shrieve held hostage, they made their way back to the pharmacy. Unfortunately, Akio was already dead. Shrieve revealed he had played them revealing "the cure" was insulin for his diabetes. His intention was to learn their location and he'd had soldiers following them all along and laser sights were immediately pointed at them.
   Oliver, out of rage, attacked Shrieve catching him off guard, pummeling him to a pulp, while Maseo shot the incoming soldiers. Oliver subdued Shrieve burrowing an arrow in his leg.
  </p>
  <p key="b09bf688-0abc-4db5-a83f-17e8c319dc19">
   Three days later, the bioweapon had been contained. Akio's body had been burned with his ashes held in three metal containers. In revenge, Oliver returned to the pharmacy where he was holding Shrieve and, using his arrows and all the tools he got his hands on, tortured Shrieve for hours until the general was unconscious. Maseo and Tatsu came back and Tatsu was horrified by what Shrieve had done but Oliver simply stated that he'd "failed this city" and Maseo shot Shrieve dead. Oliver looked on and listened as Maseo left Tatsu.
  </p>
  <p key="34baa50a-3c0f-4a38-8b30-eeadf1d1c2a6">
   Oliver met with Tatsu at the port. He told her he wasn't going back to Starling City, because of his torture of Shrieve and he didn't want that darkness around his sister and mother, and said that he "needs to be alone". Oliver gave Tatsu a hug, wished her well and boarded a ship for Coast City.

   Waller then drugged Oliver and forced him back on Lian Yu to infiltrate a
   drug lord

After he took John there, John sought and performed a spell to uncover the hidden passageway, much to Oliver's shock. Once inside, they explored the cave where John explained that there are areas of the world as old as it including Lian Yu, possessing things corrupt men aren't supposed to have such as Reiter.

   John eventually found what he sought and retrieved it but set off a trap which Oliver saves him from being killed by, insisting he's not one of Reiter's men. After exiting the cave John thanked Oliver for saving his life and broke off the crystal off the rod to give to Reiter, as the rod itself is what contains the magic. John also warned Oliver about Reiter, insisting his narcotics aren't his only interest for being on the island. As insurance John also used the rod to transfer a spell on his arm onto Oliver's torso, insisted he'd know what to do when the time came and on Oliver's request, John punched him out cold as part of his "escape" and left on his boat, but the two would keep in contact.

Oliver encouraged her again, telling that he used to watch picture of Laurel to remember who he once was, but stopped since he wouldn't survive on Lian Yu and neither would Taiana by being the person they once were. Coming back to the prison side, Taiana tricked Reiter's men to the caves where Oliver shot them and distracted the remaining ones while Taiana free the prisoners. They armed themselves to kill all Reiter's mercenaries and trapped Reiter in the caves.

Continuing their journey, two of Reiter's men found them and shot Oliver and Taiana. While Oliver was pushed back, Taiana was unfazed and mercenaries death made her even more powerful and corrupt. Oliver tried to talk her out of using the Idol too much, but Taiana didn't listen to him. They found some prisoners fighting mercenaries and after taking them out, Taiana wanted to kill a harmed prisoner, since it would make her more powerful.

   AKA Human Target, who was hired by Anatoly on the belief that Oliver was still in danger. After an attack from Kovar, Oliver was send by the
   godfather
   of the Bratva on an undercover mission to destroy one of his casinos. Oliver was discover and Kovar men's tortured him for an entire week. Oliver did not break, forcing Kovar admiration. He invited him at his table, revealing that Taiana's mother was one of his employees. Oliver tried to escape by taking Kovar hostage but he was too weak to do so and end up challenging him into a fight in front of his men. Oliver was incapable of keeping up with the fight and Kovar beat him violently.

   Just as the fight finished, Bratva men appear, revealing that they made a deal with Kovar while Oliver was prisoner. Kovar use this to taunt Oliver about the nature of truth and loyalty, mocking his naivety about the Bratva and their business.

  <p key="4d55d81b-228a-472f-925d-3c51900f7c45">
   Outraged, Oliver told Bratva Pakhan Ishmael Gregor that his deal with Kovar betrayed the organization, the latter responding that his decisions were law and offered him a choice between swearing loyalty to him or dying. Oliver refused, but before Gregor could kill him,

   She took and had him recover at her place, before she offered to help Oliver take down Kovar by targeting
   Misha Yurievich
   , who happened to be Kovar's primary revenue. Oliver accepted Talia's help and they raided and killed Yurievich and his men. Upon returning to their hideout, Talia reminded Oliver that his father has left him a list of "all the Kovar" of his city and that he had to set a mission for himself to make them pay, telling him that he had to come to terms with the monster inside him, as she presented him with a
   green hood and suit
   , along with a bow.

   Later, Talia helped Oliver to track down and kill
   Hideo Yamane
   , an individual on his father's list and one of the main drug lords of Starling City, while he was in Russia for his business. After this, she encouraged him to talk to Anatoly in order to leave Bratva and go back to his city to begin his mission; however, after Oliver discovered that Pakhan Gregor had Anatoly severely beaten just because he disagreed on his deal with Kovar, he proposed to his friend a plot to kill the Pakhan. However, before the two could decide their moves, Gregor and his men attacked them in the hospital where Anatoly had recovered. As they were about to be killed, Anatoly invoked the "spros dopros", a Bratva trial in which the Pakhan is asked to answer for his deeds. Before the process, Oliver broke into Kovar's home finding evidence of Gregor's corruption, therefore the majority of the Bratva captains decided to vote for Anatoly as the new Pakhan; then Gregor's men opened fire on them starting a mutiny.

   After the shootout most of the captains are killed and Gregor escaped with some of his men intending to promote new captains loyal to him; however Oliver, dressed in his green suit, and Anatoly, attacked Gregor during the meeting with his loyal Bratva members. After a confrontation on a hockey rink, Oliver managed to stop Gregor, badly injuring him. Before passing,
   Gregor
   reveal to Anatoly that
   Kovar
   was planning a coup to overthrow the Russian government. As the Hood, Oliver attack a shipment containing sarin gas destined to Kovar and torture one of his men to gain information. He learned that Kovar was planning to use the gas in his casino to kill government officials and military. He attacked the casino with the help of the Bratva, freeing them after they got betrayed by Viktor and preventing the gas from leaking.

   . Oliver then asked Anatoly if he could get transportation back to Lian Yu, as it was the one alibi that could explain why he had been gone so long. Anatoly asked him to reconsider, wanting him to become a full-time Bratva member. After Oliver refused the request, Anatoly asked him to visit a hospital with him. They saw many sick children and Anatoly revealed that he wanted to steal medicine from a warehouse to help the kids and have their faith in the Bratva. This heist would also act as a goodbye celebration for the both of them. After stealing and distributing the medication, Anatoly once again tried to persuade Oliver to stay. Again, he kindly rejected the offer. Anatoly relented, wondering what he would become without Oliver at his side.
  </p>
  <p key="fcbe21b5-13cd-4bd7-9b15-b56cb8be0ace">
   Oliver and Anatoly returned to Lian Yu together to enact Oliver's plan to be found there. Upon the shore, he found Slade Wilson's mask and impaled it with an arrow, believing that it was a sign. He then bring Anatoly to the graves of all the people he buried on the island, explaining why he has to complete his mission, once he will return home. Before leaving, Anatoly tells him that he bribe some fishermen to come to the island in 48h to rescue him and made it look like it was just a coincidence that they found him. He also gave him a fake beard and wig from one of his KGB's friend to further complete his story as a castaway. Just after Oliver set up his bonfire, he was taken down by Kovar and his men, telling him that he is going to miss his boat home.

   Oliver was brought to Reiter's old prison. When he woke up, he asked Kovar how he survived, and Kovar simply replied that nothing really dies. Kovar then injected Oliver with an interrogation drug right where his Bratva tattoo was. Oliver then told Kovar that after he will kill him, he'll make sure he's dead. However, Kovar told him that later he will want to kill himself. Kover then said that pain is not a new experience for Oliver, and when Oliver asked him to stop wasting his time, Kovar touched Oliver's scars, and Oliver suddenly had flashbacks of the time he got them: after Yao Fei shot him 5 years prior, when he was tortured by Billy Wintergreen in 2007 and when he was whipped by Conklin.

  <p key="a6b1446e-71e7-4125-997a-a5053c1ed74e">
   Oliver was then brought to a cell, and Kovar told him that the drug makes him remember the times he did something wrong. As Kover talked, Oliver had flashbacks of him killing Taiana, of Ivo killing Shado, and of him torturing General Shrieve. Kovar then gave him a gun with only 1 bullet, and presented him with a choice: to kill himself or to kill Kovar. Oliver didn't shoot Kovar, so he left to give him the choice.
  </p>
  <p key="2bbd4430-bef7-4d66-b2cc-9f28139fe3e2">
   Oliver then started to hallucinate Yao Fei, who told him that he deserve to die. Oliver realized that Yao Fei is not really there, and pointed the gun on him. He then said "shengcun", referring to the first time they've met; as Oliver apologized for him about what happened to Shado, Yao Fei said that it won't bring her back, such as it won't bring back Taiana, Akio, Sara or any other person he lost for the past 5 years back; however, Yao Fei told Oliver that he can save them by sacrifice himself like he did.

  <p key="e8575d8d-cba3-4542-bd2c-0384d9d6a1a9">
   Oliver then pointed the gun on his head, but as he was about to shoot himself, he experienced a hallucination of Laurel. She urged him to stop as his friends and family love him and need him at home. Laurel begged Oliver to come home, because if he didn't, then his father and her sister's deaths would be for nothing. Laurel then disappeared, and Oliver used the gun and shot the lock of the cell, opening the door and walking out.
   However, Oliver is chased by several of Kovar's men, but he outwits and kills them all before encountering a wounded Kovar. They both brawl it out, with Kovar saying that he didn't need to kill Oliver, but to rather prevent him from catching the boat. Luckily, Oliver is able to gain the upper hand and snap Kovar's neck.

   With the 48 hours done, Oliver ran to grab his gear and wig. He arrived at the shore, and shot an arrow at the bonfire, igniting it on fire and alerting the duo of nearby
   Chinese

Just then, Oliver and Tommy were taken hostage by three men wearing red skull masks, who killed a bystander in the process. The men used a taser to interrogate Oliver, demanding to know whether his father survived the accident or told him anything.

When one of the skull-masked men tried to escape, Oliver pursued him through rooftops before disarming him. The man tried to plead for his life, but Oliver pointed out he killed a civilian. He snapped the man's neck, declaring that "nobody can know my secret".

   Using Tommy's welcome back party for him as a cover, Oliver waited for the deadline to confront Hunt. He was upset upon seeing Thea buying drugs at his party and secretly threw away her stash. Oliver then ran into Laurel again and lied about how the island did not change him, claiming he was still a careless playboy and she was wrong to try and see the good in him. Oliver then stormed
   Hunt Multinational

   herbs from Lian Yu

   Max Fuller

   Unidac Industries

  <p key="5d3afbe2-ef0b-4ca3-ad84-75a9b5b5f02d">
   At the auction in the
   Exchange Building

Suddenly, Lawton attacked the event and tried killing the occupants. Oliver retrieved his suit from the stairwell and personally dealt with the assassin. He eventually shot an arrow in Lawton's right eye, almost completely blinding and seemingly killing him. Just then, Oliver discovered that Diggle, who was following him, got shot with a curare-laced bullet. He immediately brought Diggle to his lair to heal him with the Lian Yu herbs. Once Diggle woke up, Oliver revealed himself to be The Hood.

  <p key="f3b74a0c-ed84-49df-a965-4bbc725e080f">
   Oliver asked Diggle to join his crusade to protect the city as "a fellow soldier", only for Diggle to furiously decline. That night, Oliver had trouble sleeping due to experiencing nightmares about missing Laurel while on the island. The next morning, he learned Diggle had resigned and was replaced with
   Rob Scott

   After hearing of the
   Peter Declan

  <p key="6cb16202-535b-44f5-81d4-bea0fca42286">
   The next night, Oliver met with Diggle at
   Big Belly Burger

   Oliver then met with Laurel, who revealed Peter's wife's
   supervisor
   lied in the case. After interrogating the man, Oliver obtained a file of incriminating evidence against Brodeur, to which Laurel thanked him, much to his joy. When Peter wasn't freed due to insufficient evidence, Oliver decided to go to Brodeur directly and get a confession. Upon confronting him, Oliver discovered Brodeur was arranging for a prison riot at

Lance brought up the footage of Oliver retrieving The Hood's costume during the shooting at the Unidac auction, to which Oliver claimed he ran into the stairwell to take cover and stumbled upon the costume by chance. When Moira and Walter arrived, Oliver asked for Laurel as his attorney, reasoning she knew knew him the best and would be able to get her father to drop the charges.

   Later at Oliver's hearing, he was prepared to represent himself and pleaded not guilty. However, Laurel interrupted to file herself as Oliver's defense, much to his elation. Laurel managed to get Oliver posted on bail but fitted with a GPS ankle monitoring device under house arrest, perturbing him. Oliver was nonetheless glad Laurel had his back, trying to joke how it would be "like old times". Laurel retorted that Oliver could not be The Hood since it wasn't like him to help others, silencing him.

   Later, in attempt to prove his innocence, Oliver suggested taking a polygraph in front of Lance. Oliver managed to beat the polygraph, but admitted to being tortured and that he got Sara killed. Oliver then discovered
   Leo Mueller
   had infiltrated Starling City with plans to sell rifles he stole to gangs, effectively turning The Glades into a war zone. Knowing that the police would eventually make a connection to him being the Vigilante, Oliver revealed his plan to have Diggle disguised as the Hood and attack the weapons sale to "prove" his innocence. As a cover, Oliver threw a prison-themed party at the mansion while under house arrest.

During the fight, Oliver's ankle monitor got knocked off and this alerted Quentin Lance who went to investigate. The man managed to grab his pistol during the fight but before he could shoot Oliver he got shot twice by Quentin. Oliver also shared an intimate moment with Laurel as he revealed his scars to her. The two shared a kiss before Laurel left in shame, saddening Oliver. Oliver had Diggle, disguised as The Hood, attack the initial sale, "proving" Oliver's innocence. Oliver then attacked the sale himself and killed Mueller shortly after.

   Not long following his defeat of Slade, the Arrow and Roy grappled on to a "drug plane" and climbed up on top. They struggled to hold on while Felicity, back at their base, tried to hack the plane's WiFi. Unable to get a clean signal, Dig suggested to go with "plan B". Oliver proceeded to stab an arrow in to the plane. The arrow exploded and the two of them jumped in to the plane. As the occupants began shooting at the men, they began fighting back. Oliver fired an arrow at the pilot, which opened up at the end to reveal a ball, hitting the man in the face. As Roy mused over the new "boxing glove arrow" (a term Oliver claimed to hate), Oliver started to fly the plane back to stability. He placed an autopilot device on to the controls and busied himself with fighting back the remaining occupants of the plane. Roy was momentarily distracted by a comment from Oliver calling him Speedy. In this moment, one of the Spanish-speaking men attempted to fire his gun at Roy, only to get an arrow to the chest from Oliver. However, Roy was hit by a bullet and began falling from the plane.

  <p key="11bc1356-2af2-4a8e-87eb-b7f12d9b57d1">
   Oliver confirmed that Felicity's autopilot gadget was working before jumping from the plane. As he free-fell, he asked Diggle to prep for surgery for Roy's bullet wound. As he got closer he caught Roy and enabled a parachute. Back at the foundry, Oliver reasoned that their base was much closer than a hospital, so it was the smartest move. While Diggle fetched the appropriate blood, Oliver fixed his dislocated arm in order to help with the surgery. After the surgery, Oliver believed that all they could do was wait. He began to blame himself for making Roy take on such a high-risk mission. Diggle then decided to leave in order to help out his pregnant partner, Lyla.

   Felicity, meanwhile, told Oliver that he needed a new place to live as the foundry was comparable to a cave. She proceeded to accidentally imply that she wanted him in her bed, as opposed to her intended message of a bed owned by her. Eventually Roy's condition stabilized, though still being in a fairly bad way, and were his condition to worsen then Oliver would personally take him to

   . Felicity noticed a hostage situation on the top of
   Winick Tower
   . As the Arrow arrived there, he threw small arrows at the man,
   Hoshaw Tolibao
   , knocking him down. Before he could harm Oliver when he got up, he kicked him back down. On the ground, Hoshaw claimed to be a prophet for

   St. Walker's Church
   , an abandoned orphanage in which Sebastian had grown up.

   He came across some followers of the
   Church of Blood
   , who began crowding around him. Suddenly,
   Brother Blood
   appeared. The Arrow requested to know Brother Blood's identity, passing his followers off as lost souls and homeless people. This angered the followers, who began encroaching on him, trying to beat him up. Among them was
   Werner Zytle
   , who injected him with some of his enhanced
   Vertigo
   . Before they could pull his mask off, he pulled away, throwing down an explosion of smoke. While he was escaping, he found Diggle being dragged by some men to Brother Blood. He hid in the shadows, following them, as they took Dig to their leader. Brother Blood revealed himself to be Clinton Hogue, but not before The Arrow could shoot numerous flechettes in to his back, enabling Oliver to grab Diggle and run. On his way out, The Arrow beat up Clinton. They found some more followers, though Oliver once again used an explosion of smoke, and they began climbing out of the underground.

    The Huntress
   </a>

She began beating him up, getting annoyed at him for apparently forcing her to make her wear her outfit. She knocked him to the ground, while meanwhile the followers had reached the surface, causing him to warn her. He got up and went to turn round, instead finding his apparently dead father standing there. He mentioned how Oliver knew several people who had already practically been resurrected, so it was his turn. His father then turned in to his mother, who believed that she should also get a turn. She expressed her disappointment in Oliver. His mother soon turned in to

She suggested that Oliver had only let her die so Thea wouldn't find out his vigilante identity. All of these hallucinations from Zytle's Vertigo concoction,

   appeared, and he was unsure whether she was real or another hallucination. However, as she was indeed real, she knocked Ollie out in order to take him back to the Arrowcave. Back at the cave, Felicity drew some blood from Oliver and began running tests on it, finding traces of psychotropic drugs in it. He suddenly woke up, no longer hallucinating. Diggle gave him some "magic herbs" from the island and revealed how Oliver had given him plenty of bruises during their brawl.
  </p>
  <p key="d61cb666-7f3d-4d80-9592-6cf16fb44143">
   Oliver went on to determine that he'd been injected with something from one of Blood's followers, also revealing to Felicity the true identity of the new Brother Blood, Clinton Hogue. Though determined to take down Hogue, Sara cautioned restraint, offering to help but only after Oliver had some rest to recover. As he rested, he dreamed of fighting Thea, ending with her pushing him off of a rooftop. He suddenly awoke and left Thea a voice mail to call him back. As he began to walk around, Roy also woke up. Oliver explained to him what had happened and checked to see if he was okay. A day later, Oliver met with
   Ned Foster
   at Queen Consolidated. He hoped that Oliver was spending his money wisely, rather than wasting all of it partying, and mentioned how he'd found a solution to his financial instability. They entered the conference room to find
   Walter Steele
   . He mentioned how, as part of
   Starling National Bank
   , he believed he could find significant backers to help Oliver buy back his company, despite his terrible business ethic. Walter assured him that their plan could work, but it all depended on Oliver; due to his notability as a Queen.

  <p key="35c3424e-0800-4d61-ae6f-809adc63f442">
   Oliver left the office on his way to check on Felicity at her office. On the way, he received a call from Diggle, who mentioned his trip to

   and Oliver wished him luck, and to be careful. Oliver arrived at
   Kord Industries
   and asked for Felicity. The man who attended to him recognized him, noting that his friend had yet to turn up in the past two days, on top of a full month of missed days and lost time. Due to this, he fired her and wished Oliver to give her the news. He left for Felicity's apartment, but found it damaged and everything overturned. He returned to the foundry and began to suit up. He and Roy viewed Felicity's security footage, discovering that she'd been kidnapped by Brother Blood's men. Left to the two of them, Oliver unveiled a kevlar-lined suit for Roy, and the two of them left.

   They arrived at
   St. Walker's Church

   Church of Blood

They proceeded to search the room, suddenly finding an explosive in a desk drawer. They ran for their lives, before the bomb exploded, collapsing the entire building. As they climbed from the rubble, Oliver and Roy noticed a member of Slade Wilson's

  <p key="a1065133-b89f-4fea-b25e-2243e3d79ad9">
   Later on, Oliver was working out when Roy interrupted, asking for any hint of a plan. Oliver expressed some sort of feelings for Felicity, but denied them being actual feelings. That night, they arrived atop Kord Industries. Oliver left his weapons behind and they patted him down, before allowing him to board their helicopter. Once aboard, Oliver asked to commence the trade. However, refusing to do so, as Oliver had predicted, Oliver knocked almost everyone but Brother Blood out, taking his gun. He threatened to kill for Felicity if he was not taken to her. They soon arrived at the drop zone, but Hogue assured him that his men would be waiting for him, outmatching him four to one. However, Oliver was sure that this would in no way hinder him.

   Oliver began to threaten Hogue, attempting to find Felicity's location. However, he suddenly jumped at Oliver and stole his gun, though Oliver quickly kicked it out of his hand and pinned him to the ground, right as

   Bartek Kuranski
   . Felicity kicked him in the crotch, as she'd promised, but everyone was soon electrocuted by
   Lyle Bolton
   , despite Oliver's attempts to thwart him, who then took the two women hostage. Given a choice, Oliver chose Helena. Stopping
   Vanch
   from intervening, he waited for Bolton to let Helena go. As he did, she turned around and knocked him out. Oliver called in an anonymous tip for the mercenaries to the police, then they left.

  <p key="f4fa8c70-d8ee-4cce-9c98-cda123efd1cd">
   Before they left, he admitted to Helena that he'd let her choose where she felt she deserved to go. As Oliver began to take off in the helicopter, Hogue came up from behind and attempted to kill Roy. Oliver jumped to the back and tried to grab Roy, but both Roy and Clinton fell out of the helicopter, though Roy was able to grab on to the side while Clinton grabbed on to Roy himself. Oliver attempted to pull Roy up, but Roy first kicked Hogue and made him fall to the ground. They took Helena back to prison, which she'd decided on. While there, Helena suggested that Oliver keep a hold on Felicity. Back at the base, Felicity presented Oliver with a bed in thanks. In return, he gave her a bottle of wine he'd promised her nearly two years ago, and he opened it by shooting an arrow before they shared it.

Captain Lance began to announce that, using his new position as a police captain, he was formally recognizing The Arrow as a hero, as well as disbanding the task force created to hunt him down. After that, Oliver rushed on over to the foundry, where he caught up with Felicity. He awkwardly asked her out on a dinner date, which she accepted.

   That night they were on another mission, going after a member of Steelgrave's crew. Dig patched Oliver over to Felicity, and despite being in the middle of a high speed chase, he asked her as to her interests in Italian food, agreeing on it. The Arrow intercepted
   Calvin Nico
   , the man in question, just as Captain Lance also did. He thanked him for what he'd done, excusing himself as he claimed to have somewhere to be. He headed to the restaurant, changing in to a suit and stashing his bag in a compartment. He met Felicity, just as nervous as her. Unable to find anything to talk about, he admitted that he hadn't been on the island for the entirety of his five years away, specifically he'd gone to Hong Kong, for one. He went on to describe how he learnt to stop trusting people, only to begin to do so again when he first met Felicity. Oliver began to suggest that they had the potential to begin a relationship, but the conversation was cut short by a rocket launched aiming for The Arrow.

   The two of them were knocked out, and Oliver awoke to a badly battered Felicity. He picked her up and took her and his bag back to the base, where he lay Felicity on a table. Roy discovered a GPS tag on Felicity's jacket, Oliver inferring that it had been meant for him, hence the explosive. He gave Lance a call, alerting him as to the situation, and wishing to find the leader of the gang. Felicity suddenly woke up and was comforted by Oliver. Oliver suited up and headed to where they assumed Steelgrave's men to be, where he also found Quentin, who told him of the suspect,

As Oliver started to hallucinate, Werner explained that he had brought back the Vertigo drug with an addition that made one see their greatest fear. Werner began to turn in to Oliver himself, and resulted in him fighting The Arrow and even winning, holding him up against a wall. Quentin began shooting, distracting him long enough for The Arrow to run off. However, Quentin collapsed and Werner started to walk to him. Before he could do any harm, he was shot with an arrow and fled. The Arrow requested Felicity call an ambulance for the captain.

Oliver began a heartfelt speech to the board members in a hope to win the bid for the company, only to quickly be squashed by Ray's motivational speech regarding "QC" transforming the city in to a "Star City". They left and Oliver decided that, clearly having lost to Ray, he had previously made a decision to put aside "Oliver Queen" anyway, and so it was likely for the best. Back at the base, Diggle updated Oliver on Werner's next targets, three crime bosses. Oliver and Roy suited up, while arguing that Diggle had to stay at the base as he was a soon-to-be father.

Werner threw a Vertigo-laced dart at him, though Arrow was able to overcome it. Suddenly, Canary appeared to help keep down Werner's accomplice. Arrow was surprised to see Canary back, but quickly made sure to tie up Werner. They went for a walk and caught up. Sara suggested that she might return permanently to the city, but advised that Oliver needed to have non-vigilantes in his life. Soon after, Oliver headed to the hospital to find Diggle and Lyla, the latter of whom had given birth. John thanked Oliver for giving him the right advice and the two hugged. Out in the hallway, Felicity and Oliver briefly talked about their situation, before kissing and Felicity walking off upset.

Laurel attempted to explain what had happened, before Oliver closed her eyes and comforted Laurel. Oliver met Laurel upstairs, where she told Oliver of a stuffed shark that Sara was fond of. Oliver promised to find Sara's killer, to which Laurel attempted to suggest that she would also help, though Oliver recommended that she had helped enough thus far. Laurel left, leading to Oliver calling Thea, wishing to simply hear her voice, though he only got her voice mail. Felicity approached, letting him know that they had no video surveillance to go off, so he instead decided to go and survey the area.

  <p key="7c65e3fc-36c6-4101-ae87-30a2bc988ed9">
   At the scene, Oliver was only able to find a piece of metal, but meanwhile imagined Sara's murder. Diggle approached, having learnt of Sara's death. He attempted to get Oliver to take some time off of work, but Oliver claimed his vigilante work was all he could do, and proceeded to dissect what he could take from the scene, leading to Dig offering his help. Suddenly, Oliver was called by Felicity, who alerted him to Quentin wanting to meet. Despite initially fearing it would be about Sara, he was told of a corporate financier named
   John Burke
   who'd been killed through seemingly similar means to Sara.

   Back at the foundry, Dig and Oliver brainstormed possible archers, Oliver suggesting only 10 he knew of, most of whom were in the
   <a href="League of Assassins (Earth-1).html" key="ba36507a-053b-45bc-8044-b41fb166b7c3" title="League of Assassins (Earth-1)">
    League of Assassins
   </a>
   (counting out those, as they didn't target their own). Felicity alerted them to a new attack by the archer, so Oliver had Diggle check A.R.G.U.S.'s database for potentials while he went to question a likely witness. At the crime scene, The Arrow prevented the man from escaping, before finding out that the man he was looking for wore a black hockey mask. Contacting Diggle, he found out a likely suspect was
   Simon Lacroix/Komodo
   . Patching through to Felicity, she was able to pinpoint Lacroix. As Komodo almost shot an arrow at a victim, Arrow intercepted. They began driving at each other on motorbikes shooting arrows though Komodo won the match and escaped.
  </p>
  <p key="bcf189cc-46e8-4ab2-b1dc-5e13721eaf59">
   Back at the base, they decided on a new tactic - rather than searching for Lacroix, they would attempt to search for his targets. The search took a while, causing Oliver to become impatient and Felicity to become annoyed at him in return. She proceeded to question how Oliver could act so coldly, yet Oliver claimed he could never have that luxury living the life he did. Felicity simply got more upset and stormed out. Following that, Oliver attempted to call Thea again. Not replying, Roy decided to reveal that she'd left him a note upon her leaving, promising to never return to Starling. Oliver read the letter while Roy apologized, and Oliver simply accepted the apology. Laurel came to the team with information regarding Lacroix and determined his next target,
   Tom Weston
   , and Oliver left to Ray Palmer's Star City pledge, despite Laurel's attempts to join him.
  </p>
  <p key="a529c8fc-3a06-494e-b4fd-32205e2ffe7b">
   At the event, Komodo inevitably attacked Weston but the Arrow and Roy intervened. Despite his efforts, Komodo was eventually pinned to a wall and unmasked. Laurel appeared aiming a gun at Lacroix. She accused him of killing Sara, though he explained where that he was in
   Blüdhaven
   to night of Laurel's claim. Oliver dragged Laurel off after she'd realized the gun wasn't loaded. The following morning, Oliver reassured Laurel that Lacroix's alibi was authentic. He promised to eventually find Sara's killer, but he had no clue when that will be and urged her to tell her father of Sara's death. That night, they buried Sara in her previously empty grave, and they all payed their respects. Back at the foundry, John decided that he would re-join the team, as long as it took to find Sara's killer. Following on from that, Oliver decided that they would have to go find Thea and bring her home. Oliver expressed that he didn't want to die down in the basement, before John told him not to and left.

  <p key="27bd6a4d-10f9-49c2-88cf-cacb3a01247a">
   The Arrow ran down a man, questioning him on Sara's death, giving him a piece of evidence from the scene containing his DNA. The man confessed to having been up there drinking but left when Sara showed up after she told them to get lost. Oliver headed back to the base, frustrated that the trail had gone cold. Felicity revealed to have found Thea's true location:
   Corto Maltese
   . The three men decided to head to the country.
  </p>
  <p key="dbb04d43-d0af-445b-b771-35b3a1dfcdfe">
   Once in the country, Diggle and Roy settled in to their hotel while they allowed Oliver to find Thea. Oliver found Thea, working at a cafe who was surprised to see him. They began talking, and he revealed to have two plane tickets home: one of them for her. He empathized with her, asking her to come back home with him. Despite claiming to love him, she refused to return at all. Oliver left to help Diggle with a job for Lyla, finding an A.R.G.U.S. agent who was unresponsive,
   Mark Shaw
   . Diggle approached as Oliver stayed to watch from afar. After all was clear, they headed to a site, Oliver still observing as backup. When Shaw double-crossed Diggle, Oliver revealed himself, running after Shaw, but he drove away before he could be stopped.
  </p>
  <p key="21234b2a-e9e9-42a2-a7ec-85481665d471">
   They conferred with Lyla, who promised to be sending a wet team to back them up, asking them to keep their powder dry. However, they chose to disregard her message, going after Shaw instead. They called Felicity, who they asked to ping Shaw's phone and determine his location. Meanwhile, Oliver decided to tell Thea "the truth" in order to get her to come home with them. Diggle reasoned that he'd likely lose Thea if he did, though Oliver further reasoned that he'd already lost her to Corto Maltese. Oliver met with Thea, expressing his fear that he would indeed lose her, but she explained that the lying about her own life, particularly her birth father, was what had driven her away. In hearing this, Oliver revealed the truth about their father's suicide, which Oliver had always mentioned as an accidental drowning. He explained that both of their parents had sacrificed themselves so both of them could live, so they had to stick together.

  <p key="e01fca4a-ec23-409d-ad8f-e2c268497ab2">
   Oliver met back up with John and Roy at the scene of Shaw's buy. As the buy was going down, a group of hired men arrived and began shooting at the three spies. They began shooting and firing back with homemade bows and arrows. After he'd ran out of arrows, Oliver grabbed Diggle's gun and shot numerous soldiers, much to the surprise of Roy. Oliver took out the buyer and his guards, taking his laptop of A.R.G.U.S. names, right as Diggle knocked out Shaw, allowing him to go and effectively leave A.R.G.U.S.. They later waited at the airport, disappointed that Thea had not arrived. However, she shortly arrived, much to the particular delight of Oliver. A nearby passenger spilled his coffee all over Thea's hand, though she was unfazed, which weirded out Oliver. Back in Starling, Oliver came across Laurel, who had been injured in a fight. She expressed her wishes to train and help people like Sara had, but Oliver shot her down as he didn't want her to get hurt. Down in the cave, Oliver and Roy talked about Thea, as Oliver seemed to believe Thea was acting differently. However, they were quickly interrupted by Nyssa, who was looking for Sara.
  </p>
  <p key="3e045c52-0da5-40b8-b507-f1aa254d0588">
   After explaining that Sara had been killed and eventually buried, Nyssa left. Believing she knew something, Oliver asked Roy to follow Nyssa while he met Thea. At the restaurant, Oliver offered to pay, despite being broke, but Thea revealed that she would be buying back

   </a>
   with the help of investors, allowing her to spend a bit of money herself. Following dinner, Oliver left to follow Nyssa, finding her in an abandoned building which she revealed to be Sara's old place. Nyssa went on to reveal that Sara had been in Starling to confirm rumors that Malcolm was alive much to Oliver's shock. They headed back to the base, where Roy expressed his skepticism. However, Oliver confirmed that he was indeed alive, showing photos they'd found on a camera from Sara's safe-house, dating back only a few weeks.
  </p>
  <p key="ebf78d27-4a14-413b-ab35-09419dccc73b">
   Following that, they inspected some paper Sara had left in her boot, which Nyssa determined had ghost ink on it, revealed only with heat from a fire. Finding pieces of information regarding an individual named Jansen and that Sara had gone to her father for help, Laurel was sent to talk to Quentin. Oliver, Roy, Diggle and Nyssa headed to the monastery of
   Ken Zhi Jansen
   , a Buddhist monk who had helped Malcolm, and whom Sara had been tracking down. Nyssa found who she believed to be Jansen, though it was in fact Malcolm himself, who quickly got away, despite an attempt by The Arrow to stop him.
  </p>
  <p key="ef9be4b8-7d16-42bb-b488-e0366e108c28">
   Back at the base Oliver revealed to Laurel that Malcolm was still alive and was a likely suspect. He went on to mention how he'd tagged him with nanites, traceable via GPS. Laurel got angry that Oliver didn't kill Malcolm when he had the chance, though he reasoned that he would forever be able to trace him, before Laurel stormed out. Nyssa offered to speak to Laurel. Oliver sent Roy to watch over Thea, in case Malcolm contacted her, and had Diggle monitor the tracer program in place of Felicity, who was out of town. Oliver was guided by Diggle to an air conditioning factory, where Oliver was discreetly called by Malcolm, explaining how he'd outwitted him. He asked him to come, unmasked, to
   Nelson Plaza
   , an extremely public place, in order to talk completely alone but assured that if even one member of Team Arrow were to show he won't come.
  </p>
  <p key="a752ea55-db6d-4035-8f07-0e795a87d520">
   At the plaza, Malcolm reasoned that, as he already had a blood debt with

    Ra's al Ghul
   </a>
   , it was illogical to have killed Sara. He also went on to mention how he'd only come back to Starling City for Thea, as he'd saved her the night of Slade's siege. He swore on Thea's life that he wasn't Sara's killer, before walking off. The following morning, Oliver met Thea at
   The Grind &amp; Jolt Cafe
   , revealing that she'd previously been saved by Malcolm Merlyn, thinking that she had no clue. Despite being seemingly skeptical, Oliver reassured her that it was true. Heading back to the cave, Oliver told Nyssa of Malcolm's motives. As Nyssa walked off angrily, Diggle reasoned that although Oliver had made a vow not to kill, Nyssa made no such vow.
  </p>
  <p key="2c1185c0-48b1-4fe5-bc1c-12b0137c8ab6">
   Soon after, Nyssa kidnapped Thea in order to lure Malcolm. Oliver and the team were able to notice the smoke signals she'd sent up and the former headed to the warehouse while the rest secured the perimeter (sans a post-tranquilized Roy). Arrow shot down a tied up Thea, allowing her to escape, before engaging in combat with Nyssa. Dark Archer quickly intervened, the three fighting each other. Before long, Dark Archer pinned Nyssa against a wall and before Arrow knocked Dark Archer down. Claiming to have not killed Sara, Malcolm gave Arrow the simple choice to kill him or not. However, despite Malcolm being a killer, Arrow wished to not break his vows and let Malcolm go. Back at the base, Oliver claimed protection over Malcolm, warning Nyssa not to let any League members near him so long as he is in Starling while she threatened that he'd made an enemy. As she left, Felicity arrived back from Central City. Oliver soon headed upstairs to make sure that Thea was okay, before leaving her and Roy to talk.
  </p>
  <p key="52fc1d2b-8ffa-4dff-8ed8-756abd9dc31e">
   Oliver fought with Roy using bo staffs. Roy claimed to have had little sleep, causing Oliver to knock him over. Following that, Oliver went to see Thea at her new place. He believed that she could never afford the loft, though Thea explained that she'd inherited the remains of Malcolm Merlyn's estate. Despite his attempts, Thea refused to let Oliver convince her to throw away the supposed "blood money". Thea left to upstairs when suddenly lights all over the city began going out. Thea rushed downstairs to find Oliver, but he'd already left over the balcony. In the streets, Oliver promptly saved a woman from being hit by a car. He walked past a store of TVs when a man claiming to be part of "
   Brother Eye
   " explained that they would be bringing the city to its knees.

  <p key="2e25f069-81b7-4b29-81fb-50a321d9be45">
   After the transmission, the city's lights were switched back on. Oliver met with Diggle and Felicity at

    Verdant

   where they were introduced to
   Felicity's mom
   . As they went to go downstairs, Oliver expressed his hesitation to Diggle taking
   his daughter
   downstairs. Felicity assured Dig that her mother loved babies and so they handed her over and headed down to the cave. Unable to find them as the previous virus had deleted itself, Oliver wished to find the group before there was a "next time".
  </p>
  <p key="d9897675-1548-4d90-bf8d-4e80946952a5">
   Brother Eye soon made another broadcast, which Oliver had Felicity trace through breadcrumbs. Learning of the SCPD's dispatch of a riot squad to the
   Starling National Bank
   after a threat from Brother Eye, Oliver and Roy suited up before heading over. They shot arrows which released tear gas, dispersing the rioting crowds. During this, Oliver talked to Felicity, who eventually determined that she couldn't stop the virus as she'd written it 5 year prior.
  </p>
  <p key="a273b52c-2c0a-4b5c-a054-e96e0b683f1d">
   Back at the cave, Felicity attempted to explain herself before getting flustered. Oliver calmed her down, asking her to start at the beginning. After she'd explained herself, Felicity looked in to
   Myron Forest
   , a potential suspect, while Oliver took care of Thea upstairs, leaving via the alleyway entrance. Thea was trying to get in to the sub-level, while Oliver lied that he'd been told it was completely flooded. He claimed to be there as he was concerned about her, while Thea wished to reconnect with her brother despite their earlier dispute, as she believed family was always family.
  </p>
  <p key="fd54a0fb-9b72-4b6d-8d75-c0cf5c6119ea">
   After this, Oliver and Roy went to interrogate Myron Forest. He reasoned that he was the exact image of what the activists hated, so it was clear that he wasn't part of Brother Eye. They headed back to the

   , where Oliver made sure that Felicity's former boyfriend wasn't behind it. Not knowing why she was so adamant, she explained in detail how he'd hung himself in prison, absolving him completely, before she stormed off crying. When she came back and ran a tracer hack, Oliver made Felicity leave again, this time for an hour to make amends with her mom. After she didn't return, Diggle had an A.R.G.U.S. agent go to check out Felicity's house while Oliver attempted to call her, though she didn't respond.
  </p>
  <p key="fa8dce0c-5732-46ba-b371-d032cbba3d81">
   Meanwhile, Felicity had been kidnapped, though she'd allowed Oliver to trace her. Once he'd found her in an abandoned building, The Arrow brought down motion-sensored machine guns facing him and pointed an arrow at
   Cooper
   , who'd taken Felicity hostage. Before he could shoot Felicity, she grabbed his gun and beat him down. They soon returned to the base, where Oliver assured Felicity that her rocky experiences shaped her into the person she is today. Felicity thanked Oliver for his advice on loving one's family and left to talk to her mother.

As Ted was being questioned Arrow questioned Laurel's involvement with him and realized that she was following in Sara's footsteps as he had previously advised against but Laurel still insisted that Ted was innocent as they were at dinner when the murder happened. Arrow broke into Ted's gym and found a secret room where Ted jumped him though Arrow quickly overpowered him, questioned him and learned that he too was once a vigilante but after accidentally killing a man he retired. Arrow and Ted then went to the scene of the supposed murder Ted committed but were jumped by a masked man who Ted knew but the cops showed up and arrested Ted.

Later Laurel and Ted were kidnapped by the mask man, Ted's former protégé
   Isaac Stanzler

   Later Roy told Oliver that Issac claimed he was just another "weapon in his arsenal", leaving Oliver to think that "Arsenal" should be Roy's code-name. He also used Tatsu's mind technique to uncover why Roy was having visions of killing Sara but this only made him remember the cop he murdered while high on Mirakuru, only seeing Sara because she and Oliver were present when it happened.

When Arrow arrived, he realized that Carrie was the same woman he saved during Slade's attack, and tried to reason with her love sickness but this only provoked her into fighting him into the train tracks below where she almost killed them both but Arrow saved her before having her sent to Waller and the Suicide Squad. Acting on Diggle's advise Oliver went to tell Felicity of his feelings, only to see her and Ray kissing, highly enraging him so he and Roy instead went to John's apartment where he and Lyla were having dinner.

The next day Barry met Oliver for more training where Oliver told him that he needed to take his advise if he ever wants to help more people then hurt them but Barry, having been earlier affected by Bivolo, came to believe that Oliver was jealous.

However Arrow was unable to torture Boomerang into disarming the bombs, haunted by his own previous actions, but Barry, Caitlin, Cisco, Felicity and Roy where able to stop the bombs and Harkness was sent away for good.

Oliver eventually discovered Malcolm Merlyn, in reality was the culprit behind Sara's death, but he used a plant on Thea to make her susceptible to suggestion while not remembering anything that happened while she was under the plant's influence and had her kill Sara. Malcolm threatened to show the League the recording of Thea killing Sara if Oliver told the League Merlyn was behind this.

Oliver tried to talk Tatsu into convincing Maseo to return to Starling with him but she claimed she could convince Maseo, but not Sarab, as the events of Hong Kong made him overwhelmed with grief. Later as Oliver prepared to leave League members showed up looking for Maseo who discovered Queen alive but Maseo killed them and injured himself to allow himself back into the League and for Oliver to return to Starling.

While she is busy making tea, Malcolm agreed to train Oliver. However once Felicity heard this, she was unhappy that Oliver is going against his vows, vows that Felicity swore to Malcolm that Oliver would never break. Arrow and Arsenal pursued a culprit throughout the city but as they closed in on him Laurel, heading out as Black Canary again, took him down and Arrow scolded the new Canary for her actions but she told him to back off. In the Arrowcave itself Oliver scolded Diggle and Roy for letting Laurel pursue her recklessness but they were soon interrupted with another visit from Malcolm in the cave.

Arrow and Arsenal distracted Vertigo's men long enough to pull Black Canary out of the battle and treat her vertigo infection, which caused her to see Sara. Thea came down stairs to ask about Laurel but Oliver demanded that she leave, but Roy stood up to Oliver, telling him she has the right to see the situation and that she makes her own choices, but Oliver becomes mad that Roy stood up to him until Diggle and Felicity calmed the situation, with Felicity telling him off, saying that he was gone, and they had to move on without him and that he does not get to question people's choice.

After the meeting, Oliver asked Barry what's bothering him and he revealed that he already lived the events of the next day and traveled back in time to reluctantly change it, telling him that everyone died because neither Oliver and Kendra are emotionally ready for the conflict because he just found out that he has a son and Felicity broke up with him for not telling her the truth about it, and Kendra is resistant to embrace who she is. Oliver confronted Cisco and told him to talk to Kendra and help her embrace who she is and succeeds and she gained the knowledge of how to beat Savage, a material in the meteorites that destroyed Egypt 4000 years ago which also powers Savage's staff.

As Diggle suggested John Constantine, Oliver revealed that he was literally in
   Hell
   itself, but told them about someone else that could help:
   <a href="Mari.html" key="8f56aadb-f3c9-459a-b61a-d02d14600e29" title="Mari">

   Green Arrow traveled to Detroit to seek her help as Vixen was engaging 3 armed gunman and after they took them down, he asked for her help. Back in Star City Oliver introduced Mari to John, Thea, Laurel, Felicity and Samantha and using her powers, she found William's scent and Oliver ordered his team to follow. As Vixen followed his scent Oliver asked Dig if what happened was his fault but John reminded him not to blame himself or contemplate what would have happened, as being a parent was not considering the what ifs but focusing on keeping their child safe. Another part of being a parent is knowing where their child is at all times like John does with Sara and told Oliver to consider keeping William close, to keep him safe. After Vixen found William's location Green Arrow and Vixen confronted Darhk and despite the added strength and managing to hurt him, Darhk still proved stronger than them. He also revealed that he had William moved minutes before their arrival.

   Darhk used his magic to throw Green Arrow out a window but Vixen was able to catch him and stop him falling to his death, but by the time Black Canary and Speedy showed up Darhk was gone and Vixen was unable to track William. After returning to the Arrowcave Oliver promised a panicking Samantha they'd find William but was contacted by Darhk telling him that, in order to prevent "Green Arrow" from ruining things he was to drop out of his campaign immediately. Mari apologized for being unable to fight Darhk but Oliver reassured her it wasn't her fault that they don't even know where Darhk's powers come from. Mari however suspected that Darhk must use an amulet of some kind the same way she draws her powers, which Quentin confirms having seen an idol in his office from time to time.

  <p key="181d4dba-9d58-415b-b502-45dd24329862">
   As per the agreement, Oliver held a press conference declaring his withdrawal and giving his full support to Ruvè Adams and afterwards apologized to Alex for wasting his hard work, but he asked for an explanation which Oliver wasn't able to give. Oliver was called by Mari and informed that Darhk's power was indeed drawn from an idol but was interrupted when Darhk called telling Oliver to meet him at
   Nelson Plaza
   in 3 hours but Felicity was able to track his current location. Instead Oliver, with Samantha's consent, led the team to Darhk's estate. Before leaving however Mari talked to Oliver about William and that keeping William out of his life could be what's best for him. Mari explained that she grew up in a foster home because her parents gave her away because of the evil they were surrounded by, and maybe he should do the same.

   At the estate Green Arrow, Black Canary, Spartan and Speedy attacked Darhk's men while Vixen stole the totem. During the assault however Darhk confronted the three and begun to chock them to death in front of William but Vixen was able to break the idol and cut off Darhk's access to his powers. Green Arrow then overpowered and defeated Darhk and fled as the police found William. At the police precedent Quentin told Oliver and Thea what William told the detectives, that Darhk didn't kidnap William that Malcolm did. Later Oliver talked to Mari as she was leaving town who reminded him of what she said earlier, that staying out of his life is what's best for him and he agreed. Oliver then made a recorded message to William for him to view after his 18th birthday telling him that he is William's biological father and that he has remained absent from his life, because he is the Green Arrow. After recording the message Felicity stops by and puts her ring on the table and tells him she can't be with him if he can't trust her. At that very moment, her spinal implant activates and she is able to walk again but leaves in tears.

   A week later,
   Cupid
   , heartbroken by Deadshot's death, returned to Star City and started targeting celebrity couples on their wedding day in an "anti-love crusade". Green Arrow and Speedy managed to save her latest victims, but failed to apprehend her. To lure her into a trap, Oliver and Felicity set up a fake wedding at the
   Hochman Hotel
   . Despite the circumstances, Oliver attempted to salvage his relationship with Felicity by reiterating in his vows how much she means to him, having helped him see the light again, and declared Felicity to be his "always". Just then, Cupid arrived and shot Oliver in the chest with an arrow, mocking their love. However, Oliver was unharmed, having wore a Kevlar vest underneath his suit. Cupid then showed them a detonator, revealing she rigged the hotel with C4 bombs.

   When Cupid attempted to undermine the couple's relationship, Felicity countered that she and Oliver became the best possible versions of themselves due to their love, as it gives life meaning. Using the distraction, Speedy and Spartan engaged Cupid. Oliver eventually used Diggle's gun to shoot Cupid with a stunning dart. She was then delivered to the SCPD. Afterwards, Felicity broke up with Oliver for good and decided to leave Team Arrow, explaining that while she loves him, she can't trust that he won't lie to her again after what happened with William. Oliver pleaded Felicity to reconsider, not wanting to let her go, saying he needs her in his life. Felicity sadly replied she's "already gone".

Oliver and the team launches an assault on the building to rescue them but he is injured during the attack and has one of Larvan's robotic bees slowing multiplying inside him until it eventually kills him. Using an idea from Curtis Holt, Laurel uses the Canary Cry to cancel out the frequency that Larvan is using to control her bees and save Oliver's life.

   Later, Oliver grew frustrated at Curtis' excitement to be helping the team, angrily reminding him that people could die in their line of work. When Laurel pulls him away, Oliver tries to explain that his life as a vigilante is what ruined his relationship with Felicity and took him away from the happy life he had with her, and it isn't fair that he could save his city, but not his relationship. While sympathetic, Laurel points out that Felicity left Oliver because he lied to her as himself, not Green Arrow. She also reminds Oliver that life is never fair whether he's in Star City or Ivy Town, but he can save the city as he is a beacon of hope to the people and she wishes that he would save some hope for himself. Later, Green Arrow burst into Felicity's office, where Larvan has taken her hostages. Oliver fought a
   humanoid manifestation
   of Larvan's bees and eventually fired an arrow at her army, which held a virus developed by Curtis. After her bees were shut down by the virus, Larvan shot Oliver with her gun and began to threaten everybody in the room. However, Curtis reactivated the bees himself and used them to incapacitate Larvan. Afterwards, Oliver apologized to Curtis and decides to take Laurel's advice.

Later, Damien stages a prison riot to escape and as Oliver and the team go to confront him, Andy betrays them by revealing his allegiance to Damien, who reveals that he knows the team's identities and regains his mystical powers from the idol. While using his powers to restrain Team Arrow, Darhk, still enraged over Quentin's testimony against him, takes one of Oliver's arrows and stabs Laurel with it.

Laurel tells team that that night was supposed to be her last mission as Black Canary, but she could never give the mantle up as it makes her feel alive and she loves them so much. As Oliver and Laurel speak privately, Laurel assures him that she is glad that he found Felicity and hopes that he find his way back to her, but admits that he will always be the love of her life. Oliver was stunned and confused as to why she's telling him this now. Laurel explains that this night was a reminder to her that anything can happen. She asks him to promise not to make her the last Canary and give the identity to someone else so that way, there will still be a part of her fighting beside him and the team.

After the funeral, Oliver returned to his limo, where Felicity was in tears and told Oliver he needed to kill Darhk for Laurel's death. Oliver responds that he doesn't know how but Felicity reminds him that he has never given up trying to find a way to defeat their adversaries, and must do so now in honor of Laurel to avenge her death.

   In the Arrowcave, Oliver discussed with the team a strategy going forward, with avenging Laurel's death now their top priority. He also tells them he finally got back in contact with John Constantine, who told him that he found a way to counteract Darhk's powers by traveling to Hub City and meeting with someone who could assist them in their current situation. Oliver also makes it clear to everyone that he doesn't want to risk another attack on Darhk until they have found a permanent solution to take down him and nobody is to move on him until then, much to Diggle's chagrin.

  <p key="58376ce4-1aef-4628-9f6e-c1ec34ba60d7">
   Later as he was packing, Felicity convinced Oliver to let her come along. After arriving in Hub City, they met with
   Esrin Fortuna
   in a casino, who led them into a secret chamber. To counteract his Darhk's magic, Oliver learned to use light magic, known as the "
   Light of the Soul
   ", the opposite of the magic Darhk was using. Oliver initially failed Esrin's test after being overwhelmed by the darkness inside him, but Felicity encouraged him to keep trying. Oliver was later able to use light magic against Darhk by thinking about the positive things in his life, including Felicity, as hope was the way the light magic was triggered, like with the tattoo he was given by Constantine on Lian Yu.

   Once Oliver and Felicity returned to Star City, the team found out Darhk's endgame,
   Genesis
   , which would completely decimate the Earth with nuclear fire and start over, as he believed mankind was destroying the world. With Felicity's help, Oliver also rescued Thea from a town built underneath The Glades called
   Tevat Noah
   , where Darhk and H.I.V.E.'s followers would stay to protect themselves from the nukes.
   In Tevat Noah, Oliver and Diggle battled Malcolm and some Ghosts. They also met some of Darhk's followers, causing Oliver to question if his work was really accomplishing anything. He learned Thea had been drugged with a H.I.V.E. suggestion pill by Malcolm and helped her overcome the brainwashing by reminding her how they always fought together. Upon learning Lonnie Machin was trying to destroy Tevat Noah, Oliver, Diggle, and Thea confronted him while Malcolm evacuated the citizens. Ultimately, Tevat Noah was destroyed, with Ruvé dying in the process. She pleaded Oliver to save Nora, which he did.

   As Darhk activated the nukes, Oliver gave a public speech to the citizens rioting in Star City. He got everyone to calm down and Felicity with the help of Curtis disabled the nuke heading for the city. Oliver fought Darhk in public in front of a mob of Star City citizens. The mob helped the Green Arrow as they charged the ghosts and fought them. Oliver used the light magic to take away Darhk's magic and the two traded many punches with the fight evenly matched. Oliver picked up an arrow off the street and stabbed Darhk through the stomach, killing him, similar to the way he killed Laurel. After defeating Darhk and H.I.V.E., Oliver returned to the Arrowcave, where Diggle and Thea quit the team and retired, both they needed some time to find themselves after everything that has happened. The next day after Oliver visited Laurel's grave, he got a call from the city council announcing that he was voted to be the new mayor of Star City.

   For the next 5 months, Oliver began fighting crime in the streets on his own again with only Felicity helping him from her computer. Additionally their relationship became complicated as they had slept together once but Felicity stated that nothing had changed as she still felt that Oliver did not trust her, however, they mostly tried to stay friendly to one another. Additionally, the crime rate in Star City began to increase so Felicity suggested that they put together a new team of vigilantes together. However, Oliver quickly dismisses the subject, hoping that John and Thea would return soon. Oliver occasionally neglected his mayoral duties when protecting the city with Thea, his newly-elected Chief of Staff, covering for him. Oliver's public victory over Darhk also caused many new vigilantes to appear and sometimes get in Oliver's way while operating as Green Arrow.

Oliver resorted back to killing when necessary, as he blamed himself for Laurel's death knowing that if he had killed Darhk earlier she would have not died; this ultimately caused Thea to leave once more because killing was not what she or Laurel would want. After rescuing the rest of Church's hostages, Oliver decided to put together an

   Oliver was fighting a group of Ninjas when Felicity called him asking if they were going to Barry and Iris's wedding as they had not RSVP’d. Oliver told her that they indeed were. Arriving in Central City along with The Legends and Kara (who brought her sister Alex) Oliver assisted Barry in tux fittings and the two talked about finding true love with Barry telling Oliver that like how he was finally able to marry Iris the same thing was true for him and Felicity and encouraged Oliver to “put a ring on her”.

   At the rehearsal dinner Oliver and Felicity talked about having a rehearsal dinner, and when Felicity asked why they would have one, Oliver informally proposed to her. Felicity however quickly turned it down, explaining that they did not need a piece of paper to show their love to each other, and when the two started quietly arguing, Felicity ended up yelling that she did not want to marry Oliver, which made everyone else at the rehearsal dinner turn around. The next day both Oliver and Felicity woke up still a little frustrated about last nights argument. With everyone arriving at the Congregation at the Church for Barry and Iris wedding Oliver and the others watched as Barry and Iris exchanged vows.

   However, before the minister could pronounce Barry and Iris; he was killed by the evil Earth-X counterpart of Kara who was accompanied by the an Earth-X doppelgänger of Oliver and numerous Nazi soldiers. Oliver, Barry, Kara, and the Legends proceeded to fight them off with Oliver taking on the Dark Archer. The fight ended in the Heroes favor as Sara and Alex defeated Prometheus X and Kara defeated her doppelgänger causing the Dark Archer to pick her up and order a retreat. The group recovered at S.T.A.R. Labs, and tried to figure out the motive of their attackers it was. It was at this point Harry revealed the existence of Earth-X; the worse earth in the multiverse where Hitler and the Nazis won World War Two. Discussing their next steps, Oliver stepped forward to say they should interrogate Prometheus-X for answers.

   Going down to interrogate Prometheus X Oliver was shocked and stunned when Prometheus X removed his mask and revealed self to be none other than the Earth- X version of Tommy Merlyn. Oliver asked for a second alone Tommy, and the rest of the group abided and went upstairs to the main area. Earth-X Tommy explained to Oliver that he was born into the Reich, and the Fuhrer would kill his parents if he deserted. When Oliver attempted to assure Tommy that he and his allies would stop the Reich Tommy laughed and proceeded to taunt Oliver for his foolishness telling Oliver that the Earth-X Nazis would kill all of heroes before He then bit down on a cyanide capsule, committing suicide.

   Oliver walked on as Felicity called Curtis and asked him to find out what he could on the Nazis.

Oliver told her again that he wanted marry her but Felicity urged him to respect her decision.

Oliver, Kara, and Barry faced off against their evil counterparts with Oliver managing to harm Overgirl with a Kryptonite arrow he had had in place in the event an evil version of Kara ever showed up. Eventually they were forced to let the villains escape when Overgirl used her heat vision to cut apart the beams to a nearby skyscraper under construction. Kara held up the heavier top part while Barry and Oliver managed to stabilize the rest of the skyscraper and get the workers to safety. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs Barry and Iris talked about Thawne's return when Oliver walked in and assured them that they would stop the Reich and to hold onto the love they had for each other. Felicity walked in to tell them they had a location on the Earth-X Reich. Felicity wanted to talk to Oliver about their conversation before on marriage but Oliver told her he had to have his head in the game and that they would talk after it was all over.

   Suiting up Green Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, White Canary, Firestorm, and Alex headed to the Earth-X Nazis location and were ambushed by numerous soldiers along with Thawne and Overgirl. As they fought off their opponents Oliver and the others questioned where Dark Arrow was. As the battle continued Oliver was knocked out briefly by Overgirl. When he awoke he witnessed Overgirl about to kill Sara and shot another Arrow at her only for Overgirl to catch and break it in half. However, when she tried to kill him with her heat vision Oliver dodged and reflected it right back at her. The group eventually defeated all the henchmen, but they were the approached by Metallo who knocked most of the team out including Oliver. Oliver and the group awoke to find out they had all been restrained with power-dampening necklaces by the group of Earth-X Nazi.

   Overgirl walked in to address the heroes but doubled over in pain. Her husband came to her aid (who had taken over S.T.A.R.

It was revealed to the heroes that Overgirl needed a heart transplant, and Kara was the only person capable of donating that organ. They had taken the prism to replicate a red sun that would weaken Kara enough to cut into her and take the heart. Before being knocked out again by Metallo, Oliver told his Earth-X counterpart that he would kill him which Dark Arrow doubted.

   When Oliver's and the others awoken they woke up on Earth-X in one of the Reichs concentration camps. Oliver and group began to think of ideas on how to get escape their current predicament when they realized that the necklaces the Reich put power dampening necklaces on all of them including Oliver, Sara, and Alex who lacked powers. A siren then started going off and as the heroes tried to find out what it meant the prisoners there before them huddled closer to the fence as the Earth-X doppelgänger of Detective Lance walked in. Lance and his Nazi henchmen round up the heroes and took them out to an open field, where they were going to use a firing squad to kill them all. As soon as the firing squad got ready to execute the heroes they were saved by the Earth-X doppelgänger of Snart, who froze their weapons. The group was joined by a prisoner they met within the fence earlier, and he mentioned to Snart that he had taken his time — his identity being The Ray, and he and Snart two work together on Earth-X against the Nazi regime. Snart freed The Ray from his necklace and the heroes as well allowing them to escape the concentration camp and go back to the Freedom Fighters’ base.

   The Ray revealed that Oliver's evil doppelganger was the Fuhrer of the regime and then revealed he was from Earth-1 as well like the rest of them (sans Alex). He shared a schematic of the breach the Nazis took the heroes through, and they ask for directions but we're interrupted by the Earth-X version of Winn, who wanted to blow the breach up. Snart greeted Winn as General Schott, who explained that this was the only opportunity they had to separate the Fuhrer from his army, and says the final order was to blow up the gate. Alex tried too Winn to the side and persuade him to let them go back to Earth-1 through the breach, but the Freedom Fighter General disagreed and prohibit them from traveling through the breach. At the end, Oliver and the team returned to Earth-1 where they fought the Nazis. At the end of the fight, Oliver shot Dark Arrow, killing him.

During the reception Lance pulled Oliver aside and gave him a watch that his father gave to him on his wedding day. When Felicity threw the bouquet Curtis caught it and proceeded to give a speech - while inebriated - before he was eventually cut off by Rene. Rene finished out the speech before giving the couple a toast as they headed to the dance floor for their first dance. After they finished, Lance accidentally bumped into Felicity's mother and an awkward moment, Lance got a phone call from Oliver's lawyer and quickly rushed to find Oliver revealing to him that the prosecution had a star witness who was willing to testify that Oliver was the Green Arrow.

Cayden James was on the other end and he demanded Team Arrow to retrieve something from A.R.G.U.S. for him, otherwise he would kill Quentin. At A.R.G.U.S., Diggle used his relationship with Lyla to convince the security guard to allow him to get into her office. Using Lyla's laptop to get a location on the amplifier, which the rest of the team - who were staking out around A.R.G.U.S. - used to get closer to the amplifier. Oliver was able to successfully sneak into the amplifier's room and take it without getting noticed, and the team headed back to their lair. There, they discussed that the amplifier could enlarge the blast radius of Cayden's thermonuclear bomb. When Dinah walked in and realized the team just got back from the field she was upset she wasn't called.

Rene revealed that he was approached by the FBI who claimed they had proof that he was Wild Dog and in exchange for his testimony against Oliver, they would let him walk. Furious over the betrayal, Oliver ordered Rene to leave the premises immediately.

Thea convinced Oliver to order Diggle to call in the whole team, including Rene, to help save Lance from Black Siren and Cayden James.

However, Dinah stepped up and told Oliver she no longer believes in him, and tells the group that she's leaving the team as well. Back at the lair, Curtis approached Oliver, Felicity and Diggle, and told them that he could trust them any longer after finding out they spied on him, Rene and Dinah and quit the team as well.

At first Oliver couldn't do it, but after he laughed at Barry's thumb he succeeded.

   The two searched the extrapolator, but Iris got it first. Barry tried to convince her that they're telling the truth by reminding her something that happened when they were kids. It worked, and the two traveled to Earth-38.

   When they arrived, they accidentally terrified
   Lois Lane
   , who demanded that they will tell her who they are. Kara came to calm her and said that they are friends. She called them by their real names, which made Oliver relax as Barry's theory turned out to be true. Kara introduced them to her cousin

   Later, Oliver trained Barry to shoot arrows because he thought that he needs actual training. To prove him that he's ready, Barry offered that Oliver will run far and he will try to hit him with an arrow. Realizing that he's trying to have his revenge on him after he shot Barry 4 years prior, Oliver asked where are the remote control bows, but Barry said that he's not like him. Oliver accepted the challenge, and when Barry was ready, Oliver ran to him and caught the arrow. Thinking that he won, Oliver said "nice try", before getting shot in the back by the remote control bows. Barry got excited that he finally got his revenge, shot a few pictures, and then pulled the arrows out. Oliver became angry at him for doing this just to get a laugh, and began saying that he can't do anything without Iris telling him how to. As Barry walked away, Oliver ran at him trying to attack, but Barry made him fall. Barry then said that he couldn't lay hands on him if Oliver really knew how to control his speed.

  <p key="4cf6eedb-db46-45b5-a8e0-4f670fee0f94">
   Later, Oliver came to apologize. He explained that his skills are a result of years of loss and darkness, and that every time he uses those skills he channels his darkness, and seeing Barry using those skills for fun makes him angry. In response, Barry told him that whenever he run he feels joy and happiness, which makes him faster. It made them come to a conclusion that need to start acting more like each other in order to benefit the most from each other's powers. Kara, who used her super hearing and heard the entire conversation, came and was glad that they finally realize it. She added that they need to "act the parts" and convinced Barry to talk in a deep voice like Oliver. He jokingly said as his Green Arrow impression "wear a mask" (which is the same thing Oliver said to him when he first became the Flash). As Oliver tried to say that that's not how he sounds, Cisco came through a breach and informed them that

   A.M.A.Z.O.
   is attacking the city and they need their help. The two, along with Kara and Clark, agreed to help.
  </p>
  <p key="63634e8a-7b85-40e0-aa2a-475bcc0d05dd">
   Oliver and the gang arrived at the place through Cisco's portal. Once again, Oliver suited up as The Flash while Barry suited up as the Green Arrow. In order to keep A.M.A.Z.O. off balance, Flash shot as many lightning as he could on him. When he was weak enough, Superman fought there and punched him through the ground. At first they thought that they won, but A.M.A.Z.O. quickly came back and copied all of their abilities, including Oliver's speed.
  </p>
  <p key="34430a5a-e597-475c-a2f3-d93a3abd2260">
   A.M.A.Z.O. used that speed to run away, so Green Arrow commanded Flash to bring him back by running after him and luring him back to the scene. As he chased after him, A.M.A.Z.O. tried to shoot him using Supergirl's heat vision and stop him from running using

   's cold blast. But Flash used it to his advantage and lured him into a construction site, where A.M.A.Z.O. tried to blast him which resulted in the build falling on him. Because A.M.A.Z.O. couldn't run and phase at the same time, Green Arrow asked Flash to lure him back to where they were in order to give Superman and Supergirl an opportunity to punch him. The plan worked, and Supergirl laid the punch at the end. The cousins held him while the Flash countracted his phasing and let Green Arrow shoot him with a virus arrow. After A.M.A.Z.O. was completely defeated thanks to the virus arrow, Oliver gave Barry a thumbs up.

   Back in Star City, Oliver, Barry and Kara came to get the help of Team Arrow with the situation. When they arrived, Diggle was in the middle on an A.R.G.U.S. operation to take down Joe Wilson. Due to Wilson almost succeeding in killing Diggle, the three intervened. Oliver, who still has Barry's super speed, used it to push Wilson on a truck, while Barry, who still has Oliver's skills, shot arrows near his head, defeating him.
  </p>
  <p key="354aeca6-08bd-4852-b2a5-f5f98b1dc268">
   Back at A.R.G.U.S. headquarters, Barry and Oliver tried to explain Diggle and Curtis about the life swapping situation, but the 2 were barely able to understand it or believe it. But when Barry made a movie reference while answering to Curtis, the latter realized that it isn't Oliver. Because the red sky and the lightnings in the air began around the same time as the reality swap, the three theorized that those 2 things are related, and asked the team to investigate it while they travel to Gotham City to follow a lead. Curtis suggested calling Felicity, and Oliver replied that he already did, which made Diggle even more confused due to still being unable to get used to the fact he's talking to Oliver. When Felicity shows up, Oliver reminded Barry that they decided not to tell her about the life swap due to Team Flash not believing them, and because Oliver and Felicity already had relationship problems. When Diggle asked if the swap is gonna be permanent, both Barry and Oliver answered that they hope it isn't at the same time.

  <p key="0e654edb-6f0d-457d-89e7-cb4066db5641">
   As the three heroes get ready to head to Gotham, Oliver suggested Barry to remain in Star City, since the world still thinks that he's him and his fame and well known identity will draw unwanted attention. Barry countered his suggestion by reminding Oliver that if Gotham could handle the presence of Batman they could handle the Green Arrow. However, Oliver insisted that Batman doesn't really exist, which surprised Barry and Kara. Oliver insisted that Batman is a myth made up by the Gotham City Police Department and that he himself is in fact the original vigilante, which made Barry and Kara laugh at him. They decided to continue the conversation later, but in the meantime Barry urged Oliver to put on his mask, because walking around without it will give up his identity (as the world would see him in the Flash suit and believe that he's Barry Allen). Oliver argued that it isn't necessary because it isn't his real face, but Barry insisted that if they don't fix the life swap it will remain his face. Oliver decided to stop arguing, put on the mask, and sarcastically asked Barry if he's happy now. Kara then grabbed Barry away to bring him to Gotham, and Oliver realized that he's running there along before speeding up.

   The three arrived in Gotham City, although Oliver was late to their meeting place on a rooftop because he still had a hard time control Barry's speed. They then discussed how to find the people from Cisco's vibe, and Oliver mentioned knowing a local reporter in the city named
   Vesper Fairchild
   who can help them find the two. He told Barry and Kara that years ago he tried to persuade her that his company Queen Consolidated was above board. Barry guessed that he slept with her, But Oliver highly denied it before admitting he was not sure about that. Kara commented on the fact he slept with a lot of women back then, and Barry told her the story of when he cheated on his girlfriend with her sister, which made Oliver mad that he said it and made Kara more discuss. Kara suggested coming up with a Plan B in case his relationship with the woman is bad. Suddenly, Barry found a Bat-Signal on the roof, covered by a blanket. Seeing that as a proof that Batman exist, he asked Oliver if he still thinks the Dark Knight is a myth, to which Oliver replied that he still does.

  <p key="8f911a60-c4f4-4f0c-85a8-e62d03be21bb">
   In their civilian clothes, Oliver, Barry, and Kara walked towards the radio station where
   Fairchild
   worked. As they saw a couple getting out of a black track with an armed guard accompanying them, Oliver explained that because of all the crime in Gotham nobody talks about it, to a point that the city might as well be dead. Suddenly, a gang of thugs walked up and attempted to rob them. Oliver tried to talk them down, suggesting that they just talk, but then the main thug put a gun on Oliver's head. He then pulled the trigger, but luckily for him Kara used her super speed and simply caught the bullet. The thug thought the gun was broken, and as he was about to check it, Barry used Oliver's skills to disarm the guard, put him on the ground and then aim at him the gun he stole. Out of nowhere the police arrived and told everyone to get on the ground. However, Barry didn't listen, and the officer recognized him as the Green Arrow. Knowing how dangerous the vigilante can be, the officer called for backup. Knowing that they were captured, Oliver told Barry to stand down (by calling him "Oliver"), which he did.
  </p>
  <p key="e3c4608d-42f7-402a-b29f-4d9af608c79c">
   As they went to jail, Oliver asked the officer to try contact Laurel, who is the D.A. in Star City. When they arrived, Oliver asked the officer if they were able to contacted her, but she responded that Laurel though a night in jail will be good for them. Giving up, Oliver confronted Barry and highly criticized his actions. However Barry thought he did good as he saved him from the thug. However Oliver didn't accept that, saying that he was de escalating the situation. Kara then figured out that they tried to act like each other the same way they did with A.M.A.Z.O., but insisted it won't help them at those times: Oliver would be able to talk out of a mag, and Barry was acting to quickly. Barry asked what she would have done, and Kara said that she would have speed them out of there. Oliver then conceded that she should be in charge next time. Suddenly the officer came to inform them that their bail was posted.

  <p key="30f9e961-6882-47df-ac68-b08ed9a06493">
   They went outside and found a man at the door in front of a car. They realized he worked for the person who bailed them out, but thought they experienced enough distractions for the night. Oliver thanked the man for the early release but insisted that they would simply go to wherever they headed, but the man informed them that his boss "insists" as he showed them a gun. Barry lightly chided Kara by pointing out they she said they would not be confronted again before they all went with him. He dropped them off at Wayne Tower, the former home of Bruce Wayne. Inside they were greeted by a tattooed woman who recognized Barry as Oliver the Green Arrow. Introducing herself Kate Kane Bruce's cousin and the current inheritor of Wayne Enterprises. Kane told them that she wanted them to leave her city as soon as possible. On the roof, Kate talked to Kara and Oliver. Kara asked why Bruce Wayne and Batman both went missing at the same time – three years ago. Kate told them that Bruce couldn't live with what Gotham became after Batman left.

   . A former doctor at Arkham Asylum he experimented on his patients, but was acquitted due to technicalities. However he could not find Deegan's current address or employment so Kara decides to search the city. Thanks to information from Kate the duo learn of the location of Arkham. Outside of Arkham, Kara, Oliver, and Barry discussed how to break in when Cisco and Caitlin breached in through with Diggle to pass the message that they were contacted by an
   alternate Flash
   . Kara then came up with an idea to get them in. Kara pushed Caitlin in a wheelchair and told the administrator that she was delivering a new patient from the hospital, using Killer Frost's powers to bolster the lie. Meanwhile, Oliver used Barry's CCPD credentials and Diggle uses his A.R.G.U.S ones to infiltrate their way into an inspection. They walked down the hall, seeing the names of many of the Asylums inmates names on the door, before they found Deegan's lab.

   Deegan recognized Oliver for who he was, but refused to undo the damage he had caused and pushed a button which triggered an alarm and released all the patients so he could escape. Diggle, The Flash, Supergirl, Killer Frost, and The Green Arrow worked together to help recapture the patients. When a few almost got away, Batwoman showed up and stopped them. Meanwhile, Killer Frost faced off with Nora Fries, who was using the cold technology of Victor Fires. Killer Frost called for help as she was being overpowered and both Oliver and Barry hurried to assist her. Deegan grabbed the book from a hiding place inside the walls, but was found by Kara who took the book from him. The two showed up to find Caitlin knocked out. Oliver attempted to throw a lightning bolt, but due to still not having good control over his speedster powers he ended up knocking over several vials labeled "Crane" which spill and release a gaseous agent into the air. In front of Oliver laid Eobard Thawne: Barry's most hated enemy, While Barry himself saw Oliver as Malcolm Merlyn. This led to them both fighting each other. Barry and Oliver while fighting were constantly taunted by their hallucinations until. Batwoman appeared and stopped them, recognizing the vials and explaining they were exposed to a serious hallucinogen. Outside of Arkham Batwoman orders them all out of her city.

Barry and Oliver talked about their hallucinations and acknowledged each other's burdens with Barry encouraging Ollie not to wait to talk things out with Felicity. Oliver took Barrys advice to heart sat with Felicity and assured her they will be okay because while recent events have shown him that they might have changed as people, he will always love her no matter what and they made up. Finally, the other Flash was able to breach into Argus. Another doppelgänger of Barry Allen hailing from Earth-90 which was destroyed by The Monitor – the other man in Cisco's vibe. Earth 90- Barry revealed the Monitor uses the Book of Destiny throughout the multiverse to test worlds for an unknown crisis coming. Cisco then told the others that the The Monitor was on the street being confronted by authorities. Kara, Oliver, and both Barry Allens confronted him. Earth- 90 Barry Allen headed towards The Monitor who made him vanish with a snap of his fingers. The Monitor told the three that he was trying to save the multiverse from a crisis. He summoned the book from A.R.G.U.S and disappeared. Reality was then changed again with Oliver and Barry now in matching black and leather attire and with Kara seemingly gone. Escaping from a police unit headed by Ricardo Diaz the two found themselves confronted by seemingly Superman but in all black.

Diaz starts to arrest Oliver, who fights back and he and Barry run. Only to be stopped by a version of Superman who is dressed all in black. The two Supermen proceed to fight, while the Book of Destiny is retrieved by Kara, Barry, and Alex from the

     However, overtime, Oliver became riddled with evermore trauma, horror and guilt, for his unintentional role in Shado's death, Slade's consequential enmity against him which would haunt him in the years that followed and Sara's apparently dying a second time. When Oliver finally returned to
     Starling City
     during the mission to capture
     Chien Na Wei
     and recover the

     . Upon being told by Robert he could right his wrongs, Oliver was inspired to make a difference in the world. He returned to Maseo's side to assist his comrade and when he'd return home, he'd begin his crusade for justice for Starling City to honor Robert's sacrificing himself so he could survive.

     During Oliver's third year of being marooned, when corrupted general Matthew caused the bio-weapon to be released over Hong Kong, resulting in Akio's death, he gave into his emotions, his anger. He tortured Shrieve in cold blood for hours, in vengeance for the destruction he'd caused, and primarily for Akio's death, realizing later such actions would not make him human, filled with self-loathing and pity, the darkness that had overtaken his life, and to protect his family, Oliver decided to delay his return, to atone for his actions, he'd live in self-imposed exile resolving to better himself so to become the man his father believed him to be, he started vigilantism, targeting drug dealers in Coast City, believing that was his best course of action. After being send by Amanda Waller to uncover
     Baron Reiter

    </p>
    <p key="e518f3c7-d7e2-4b70-b709-bfcc65118d1c">
     After Oliver made a promise to Taiana to kill Kovar in Russia, is she didn't survive, he was determined to do that. Even though he was a killer and had committed multiple different crimes, he was hesitant to join Bratva, since he still thought they were a criminal organization not to be trusted. He later did join and was willing to blackmail different people, claiming that he would kill their loved ones if they didn't do what he said, as he did with
     Pyotr Friedkin
     . When he was saved by Talia al Ghul, Oliver still believed he wasn't the man his father raised and couldn't keep his promise to him. However, Talia started to show how to be in terms with his inner so-called monster and helped Oliver to become in terms with himself by giving him his first suit and bow. She helped to create Oliver an identity for his monster that was someone else and something else. As Oliver became the Hood, he channeled all his darkness and hate and pity in Hood and killed and tortured many people in Russia. It helped him to get piece, a he started to believe that he didn't kill anyone, but the Hood did. Although Anatoly tried to warn that it wasn't true, that the Hood and Oliver weren't different person, he didn't listen nor believe him, since it helped him to be in peace with himself and be more effective in vigilantism. After successfully killing Kovar, Oliver wanted to return to Starling City, as he believed he was finally ready to begin his quest to honor his father's wishes, and by mid-to-late 2012, when Oliver returned to Starling City, as he was a completely different person compared to before he was marooned on Lian Yu.
    </p>
    Although it took 5 years for Oliver to admit it to himself, due to so much pain and loss Oliver endured in his 5 years of hell, he started to enjoy killing, as it was his way to cope for everything he had suffered. If he had the opportunity to kill, he didn't hesitate, but all that time Oliver didn't admit it to anyone, not even himself, since he believed it was the Hood who killed and all the individuals that he killed deserved it.

     Upon revealing to the world he was alive after 5 years of being marooned, Oliver masked how he had matured by using the same playboy image he was before. In reality, he had become a stern, disciplined, and responsible. From which, he showed a very intelligent, calculating, and tactical approach to each of his exploits. This newfound maturity and made him always look out for those he cared for, with a newly defined sense of loyalty and service, moral compass and an indomitable will, though a severely traumatized and damaged individual.

     Oliver was immensely disciplined emotionally, he excels at masking and compartmentalizing his emotions, he has both a dry and sarcastic sense of humor, Oliver is also very intelligent and calculating in regards to others; he is quick to take notice of talented individuals that show aptitude in secrecy, and when the opportunity presented itself invites such individuals to join his crusade. The first was

    </p>
    <p key="350af202-e01e-45a3-8532-be410223a28e">
     Oliver was immensely talented in the area of subterfuge and deception. He cleverly covered his tracks by opening a night club to explain his nightly escapees while actually fulfilling his duties as the Hood and staged a public ruse in having himself arrested under significant suspicion of being the Hood while having John simultaneously pose as a decoy so to out himself. Oliver admits that he does not like lying to his friends and family about his double life, that it hurts no one anymore than it hurts him. He justifies he only does it to protect them from his secret life as the Starling City Vigilante.
    </p>
    <p key="a86fcbf4-8c80-46ae-bbaf-ec43c988c2c9">
     Oliver coldly began his vigilante crusade by hunting down and punishing the high-profile criminals on the List, by being a symbol of retribution and fear, known as the Hood. After being convinced by John, Oliver agreed to branch out in taking down regular criminals, such as the
     Royal Flush Gang
     and

     When Oliver returned home, after his 5 years of fighting for survival, he was emotionally damaged, riddled with post traumatic stress and survivor's guilt; he wore the green hood in his vigilante guise in penance for Shado's death. Oliver himself described his state of mind back then as "having no sense of hope". He outright murdered a criminal who abducted him and Tommy simply to keep his new talents secret, justifying that the man shot an innocent bystander. Also he is prone to emotional outbursts when the situation involves someone he holds dear such as when he overdosed the Count with his own Vertigo as revenge for his self-made drug coming into

     When Oliver began his crusade, he was comfortable with killing his targets if he deemed it necessary, and wasn't afraid to torture suspects for information. Though Oliver was ruthless during his crusade's earlier days, taking lives actually took a toll on him. He admits that his more extreme measures, sometimes torturing people, "takes conviction". Despite this, Oliver did display humanity for people who were crippled, such as
     Garfield Lynns
     . Instead of killing him, Oliver displayed rare sympathy for Garfield and offered him help.

Whenever he encounters these types of criminals, who often say they are the same, he fervently correct them.

     , as well as the entire jury were under Diaz's payroll (which turned out to be true) and mainly because Oliver knows full well, that if his vigilante identity is revealed to the public, every single one of his enemies would not only come after him, but also after the individuals he cares about.

    <p key="3688bed8-9e24-49d3-a727-a59378bcbb8a">
     However, After Diaz had failed to send Oliver to prison, he began open warfare on the latter and his allies. Oliver was quick to realize that Team Arrow was both overwhelmed and outnumbered, as Diaz had an army under his command. Oliver reluctantly went to Samanda Watson, whom he had a rocky partnership with for conflicting beliefs in his vigilantism. Samanda stated that she would only help Oliver if he agreed to her conditions; that he was to admit that he was Green Arrow and that he was to the publicly confess to being a vigilante; which he stoically agreed to without hesitation.

     Following the defeat of Diaz, Oliver remained loyal to his word regarding the deal with Samanda. After Felicity stated that she and John were planning to get him out, he pointed out that breaking him out of prison was impossible, as he was being sent to a maximum security prison; Oliver also states that even if he did escape from prison, Samanda would just arrest Felicity and the other members of Team Arrow in order to draw out of hiding. Felicity was then reminded by Oliver of his acceptance of the terms.

     Due to the countless experiences Oliver had lived through before and after his time at Lian Yu, he had little difficulty accepting and processing what others would consider impossible; such as superhuman powers and magic. As such, it was rare for him to be surprised at all that something new was coming along; even the existence of aliens didn't phase him too much. However, Oliver desired some normality from the incident, which led to him initially requesting that Kara stay behind while the others meet the president during the
     Dominator invasion
     (although it should be noted this was following having experienced an
     alternate reality
     , which had clearly made an impact on him).

    However, Oliver was less experienced with processing alternate realities and universes; although his experiences with

    and had to learn the hard way that although it looks similar to his world, it is a very different place; he was quick to accuse Malcolm Merlyn of also being the Dark Archer on Earth-2 only to later learn that actually he was
    Tommy Merlyn of that world
    . However, Despite this, he had no issues with fighting and beating down those who looked like his friends and allies from his Earth or with working with
    Adrian Chase
    despite being the  doppelgänger of one of his greatest enemies.

      Training from Slade made Oliver highly proficient in swordsmanship. However, his near-sole dependence on his bow and arrow over the years dulled this skill. Despite this, Oliver retained enough skill in swordsmanship to briefly duel Ra's al Ghul himself, impressing Ra's for lasting longer than most of his opponents and managed to deflect some of Ra's slashes before being defeated. Later, after training for three weeks under Ra's, Oliver greatly improved his swordsmanship skills; he was able to swiftly subdue

     Oliver's resilience enabled him to survive being impaled through the chest and thrown off a mountain long enough to receive medical help.
     After trapped in a cold climate for several years, Oliver became well-adapted to ice cold temperatures, unfazed even shirtless.
     His conditioning lets him recover from most injuries very quickly, though not superhumanly. Oliver was highly resistant to involuntary drugging, withstanding and breaking through
