   Moira does an interview about her campaign. She talks about how being a parent makes her a superior candidate to Sebastian Blood. Thea walks in and tells Moira she will not host her upcoming rally at the club. Moira takes Thea aside and reminds her that she signed a contract and changing the venue the day before isn't an option. Moira's adviser tells her she needs to be "either a mother or a candidate. You cannot split your focus". Moira agrees.

   In a flashback to seven years earlier, Oliver and Laurel are together. She asks an obviously perturbed Oliver if everything is okay, to which he responds yes. She leaves and Moira walks in. She realizes something is bugging her son and Oliver reveals that he's gotten a woman pregnant, but it is not Laurel.

   Meanwhile, Diggle has been following Thea. She does not appreciate it and asks Oliver what is going on. He reminds her that Slade is dangerous.

   The Arrow and the Canary meet Roy inside. He easily dispatches Sara and catches one of Oliver's arrows. The Arrow pulls back his hood, as Oliver, pleads with him to fight what's happening, but it doesn't work. Roy slams Oliver into a wall and stomps on his knee, critically injuring it. Out on the street, Roy encounters two police officers and beats up both of them, stabbing and killing one with an arrow, before running off.

   Sara brings Oliver to a doctor for an off-the-books treatment. He says all he can give him is a brace, but Oliver is still in tremendous pain. The doctor then reaches in to a cabinet and remarks that for a long time, the Triad would stop shipments of medicines to the hospital, but somebody stopped them (The Arrow). He tells Oliver that he always wanted to thank him.
