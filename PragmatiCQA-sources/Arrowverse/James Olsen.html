   James Olsen is the only son of
   Marcus Olsen
   , a soldier who died during Operation Desert Storm in 1991. He has a younger sister,
   Kelly
   .
   Before Marcus was deployed to the Middle East, he gave James his first camera.
   Since the death of his father, James keeps the camera with him at all times and decided to become a photojournalist.

   When James was seven, he went on a family vacation. At the hotel grounds, James and his cousins played hide-and-go-seek. While hiding during the game, the boys were approached by four police officers, who then tried to arrest them. They attempted to explain to the police that they were staying at the hotel, which none of them believed. The officers put handcuffs on James and his cousins and marched them into the hotel lobby, where James'
   mother
   happened to be. She demanded the police to let them go. The police officers believed her and released them. This incident would stay with James in his adulthood and made him desire to be seen beyond his skin color.

  <p key="bf12ab29-1b4c-4ca4-af83-692a5a5e4007">
   A funeral was held for James' father when he was young. Before the service started, James told Kelly that he would be with her to support her. James snuck into the funeral early to have a moment alone with his father, but had to leave when someone saw him. Outside, two boys confronted James, making fun of the fact that his father was dead. The boys locked James in a coffin, so Kelly was alone at the service, which bothered Kelly for many years. Not being at his father's funeral caused James to suppress the truth of what had happened. Instead, he began to tell people that he was locked in a bathroom across the street, and the funeral was over by the time he had been let out.

As James plummeted to the ground, he prayed for a miracle to save him. Superman then showed up and grasped James' hand, saving his life, which was the first time James met the superhero.
   Superman eventually entrusted James with his secret identity, Clark Kent. Clark allowed James to take the

   Kara

   CatCo Worldwide Media

   Cat Grant
   , he told her that Grant could wait, as it'd be her loss if she fired him right after hiring him. Introducing himself as the new guy, James was recognized by Kara after she saw a framed print of the first photo ever taken of Superman. James offered the copy to her, on the condition that she first tell him what her name was. After introducing herself and attempting to leave, he reminded her of the layouts she had originally come to get.

   He was later asked to lunch by Kara, though he told her to meet him on the roof instead as he entered the elevator. On the roof, he presented her with the
   blanket
   Kal-El had been wrapped in as a baby when he arrived at

   A week later, James went to the content meeting called by Cat, who first made sure everyone knew about Supergirl's recent heroic failure. James pointed out that even Superman had made mistakes starting out. He was then asked by Cat whether he could get her an interview with Supergirl by approaching the subject to Superman the next time they met, though James was reluctant to do so. After the meeting, James later tried to convince Kara that Cat wouldn't recognize her if she did the interview, giving her a pep talk when she contemplated whether she had become a hero too soon, telling her that if anyone could fill Superman's boots, it was her. The next day, James encountered
   Winn Schott
   in the alleyway outside of CatCo. After the two made several attempts to get each other to leave, they were soon surprised to learn that one another were both confidants of Kara, after she landed in front of them. She then told both James and Winn that needed to practice if she was going to be a hero, and that she needed their help, with James agreeing to do so.

   Using
   Kara's apartment
   as a base of operations, James and Winn alerted her to several emergencies occurring in National City, also simultaneously advising her how to handle the situations as well. Later at Kara's apartment, James and Winn were both thanked by Kara for their assistance as people were finally starting to believe in Supergirl. The following day at CatCo, James was given the dilemma of getting Cat an interview with Supergirl within 24 hours or being fired. Outside of CatCo, Kara offered to do the interview so James wouldn't be fired, with James telling her that he thought to move to National City he could be his own man, and escape the fame of being friends with Superman. James was then told by Kara that on
   Krypton
   no one was their own man and that apart from being his own man meant knowing when to accept help from others. James was later called by Cat about the interview with Supergirl, with him telling her to look out of her car window as the interview had already started, with Supergirl carrying her car into the air.

During their conversation, James explained that he invited Lucy to their regular game night, with Kara reassuring James before leaving that she was fine with it, despite actually she feels demoralized to see their chemistry as a couple. At dinner with General Lane, things got tense between James and the general who finally told him that he wasn't good enough for Lucy—that he surrounds himself with special people because he's not good enough himself.

To encourage her, James tells Kara the story of his father's camera, realizing for the first time he has feelings for her.

Later that night Kara invited James to her home, where they confessed their feelings and share a kiss after whom James left in a blank stare, because, along with the rest of National City, he was put under the control of Myriad.
   Under the orders of

   The next day, both him and Winn apologized for their actions, then James and Kara tried to discuss their kiss, but they are interrupted by Cat. Before the final battle with Non, Kara says goodbye to her friends and commented with James how they are "eternal interrupted", and perhaps simply not destined to be together. James was later present at Kara's apartment during the celebratory dinner they were having, where he called Kara away for a minute to present her with a present, a picture of herself that he had taken. He and Kara share a kiss, becoming a couple, just before being once again interrupted by Alex to call Kara to do her trick with the champagne bottle. The entire group then toasted to family. Suddenly, a pod falls from the sky, causing Kara and J'onn to leave to check it out.

   West National City Bank

   vigilante
   and asks
   Winn
   to make him a suit, as Winn had made

   Supergirl suit

   Although he originally declined, Winn later was forced to agree and help. He then made the
   suit
   to specifically protect James. James appeared in the suit, presenting himself as "Guardian", to fight the alien parasite infected
   Rudy Jones
   , along with
   Mon-El
   . Supergirl would eventually beat Parasite by using plutonium from a
   nuclear power plant
   , completely obliterating him. As Guardian left Supergirl tried to use x-ray vision to identify him, but since Guardian's helmet was lined with the lead she was unable to, and she allowed him to drive away on his bike. After James' antics as Guardian made the newspapers he and Winn decided to keep going with their new vigilante activities. However to avoid Kara's over protectiveness James and Winn agreed not to share their new activity with her.

   In the following days, Guardian foiled a bank robbery and made the news again. James and Winn later had drinks with Kara and Alex at the alien bar where the girls voiced their skepticism over Guardian's activities, though James and Winn defended "his" actions. Later Guardian took down another criminal robbing a convenience store then Winn told him of a hostage situation, so he left to foil it. The next day James was horrified to learn from Snapper that the mugger he'd taken down was murdered by another masked man moments after he'd left and Guardian had been blamed for it. Winn then confronted James about the murder but he stressed that he didn't kill the mugger, as Winn started panicking about getting caught and insisted they stop, James refused and promised they'd find the impostor. Guardian then attacked a gang during a drug shipment at the docks and as hoped, the impostor showed up, claiming he was doing what needs to be done and hoped they could be allies. Instead, a fight occurred which was interrupted by police unit led by
    Detective Maggie Sawyer
    who forced the Guardian to flee.
The next day Winn went to Alex to ask her to talk to Maggie about laying off Guardian though she was able to tell that Winn was hiding something. When she started to intimidate him, Winn immediately told her that James was Guardian. James and Winn discovered the impostor was targeting criminals who cheated the system, as both victims had convictions that were passed over because of technicalities. He also told him of another man who'd killed a woman named
    Julie Karnowsky
    , only to be let go because of insufficient evidence, whose husband
    Phillip
    was a former Navy SEAL who'd gone missing months ago; after deducing Phillip was the impostor Guardian found him as he tried to kill his next target and a fight ensued between them.

  <p key="09549a7e-fbf9-453f-9d59-813180821930">
   Guardian tried in vain to reason with Phillip and defeated him just as Maggie and Alex arrived; seeing Guardian and Phillip both finally convinced Maggie Guardian wasn't a threat and let him go. Later; James, Winn, and Alex celebrated Kara and Mon-El's escape from Cadmus, where Mon-El inquired to them on the specifics of human relationships.

   During the Thanksgiving dinner at Kara's apartment, James and Winn planned to tell her about their activities but are stopped first by Alex's vain attempt to come out to her mother and then by the opening of a
    breach
    .

  <p key="7a8a37bd-808d-4822-bd57-f44863db6cbb">
   When James was out trying to stop some more criminals, he had arrived just in time before one of them could shoot Winn, an accident that leaves the latter so shaken and afraid of dying that, despite James tried to cheer him up, Winn claimed that he is unsure about continuing their vigilante activities. However, the next day, after he was on the planet
    Maaldoria
    to rescue Kara, Winn told enthusiastically James about his adventure and that he is ready to get back to work as the "Man in the Van".
  </p>
  <p key="15cbdb24-ddbf-4536-a528-f9f9be8b6567">
   After one of their usual night patrol, Winn noticed that James was hurt as the suit hadn't protected him fully which made Winn a little hysterical as he had to fix it on top of making Mon-El a suit. James was surprised that Mon-El actually wanted to be a superhero but Winn told him that he had enough with the secrets and that they should tell Kara but James was adamantly against it. However, seeing Winn becoming so shaken up after their close calls, he thought that it might be time to tell Kara the truth. He called her to talk but Kara was a little hysterical herself with the apparent jailbreak of
    Livewire
    . He tried to calm her by reminding her that she wasn't the only hero in National City anymore, which did calm her, though she said that he was right as she now had Mon-El which made him a little angry. When they saw that Livewire was attacking some officers, they both took off independently to stop her. As Guardian, he arrived when Kara was fighting apparently two Livewire like metahumans and Mon-El were trying to shield the police.
  </p>
  <p key="438a2391-31a6-4abc-b2f7-614726b0e1df">
   However, Mon-El saw Kara was having trouble and abandoned them to try and help Kara leaving James to try and defend them when he and an officer got struck by some of the lightning. When they retreated, Kara and Mon-El went to Guardian and took off his helmet to reveal that it was James.
  </p>
  <p key="5d07f422-f7d3-4c0b-b1bb-a3d45bbf0090">
   After this, Kara has a massive fight with him as she disapproves the risk he is taking, however, James reminded her she is not the one who decides who can be a hero and angrily leaves. Later, it was revealed that Livewire had been kidnapped by a scientist to make Livewire soldiers and, despite founding where he is hiding, he kept the information for himself later giving it to James (although being overheard by Mon-El). As Guardian and Mon-El showed up to rescue Livewire, they were subdued by Dr. Hampton who had taken some of Livewire's powers for himself. However, Supergirl arrived to help free them and Livewire and together the four stopped the scientist and his soldiers.
That evening, Kara told both James and Winn that she had always seen them as heroes even before they became vigilantes and that if they intended to continue she will neither stop nor support them, however, they claimed they will not stop.

      Lillian
      escape during the latter's trial for Cadmus related crimes, that she (apparently) had managed to smuggle
      Green Kryptonite
      to
      John Corben
      's prison cell, so the cyborg could help Lillian escape and James believed Lena was guilty simply because she is a "Luthor", who grew up in the same household as her infamous half-brother,
      Lex Luthor
      , not because of any hard evidence and made no attempt in opposing Snapper's directives to publicize Lena's supposed perpetration, which lead to James coming at odds with Kara who stuck up for Lena to the very end, Kara (rightfully) disregarding it when James told her that he was basically doing for Lena what Clark did for Lex all those years back (however, the difference is Clark's distrust towards the Luthor family; is based out of logic, not prejudice) he even tried to prove Lena's (supposed) guilt to Kara, coming into direct blows with Metallo, only to find out the hard way that she was innocent the entire time - much to James' shame and embarrassment; despite this, James is not above apologizing or admitting when he is wrong.

    <p key="a678d41d-2480-4a72-b38b-934142e3211c">
     Although James and Lena got into a similar footing in the 6 months following the expunged
      Daxamite invasion
      , such that they defended each other (and Supergirl) during
      Morgan Edge
      's conference, their rocky acquaintanceship went back to square one after Lena made a sudden purchase over CatCo, this effectively made Lena everyone's new boss there, stripping that authority away from James. James was welcoming at first, until Lena made some unforeseen moves (i.e. holding meetings without his knowledge, arranging everything in L-Corp so she could spend more time in CatCo, etc.) that made him think she was subtly undermining his presence and purpose there, reveals that James still maintains to some degree his low-leveled opinion for the
      Luthor family
      .
    </p>
    However, James later enters in a romantic relationship with Lena; a sign that his low-leveled opinion for the Luthor family, has completely disappeared, as well as the fact that finally realizes that Lena is nothing like her step-mother and half-brother respectively.
