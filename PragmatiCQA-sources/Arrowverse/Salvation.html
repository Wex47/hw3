   Laurel finds that her parents are fully engaged in the hunt for Sara. She is disappointed Quentin didn't dissuade Dinah from continuing the search, not believing her sister is still alive. Laurel looks at the girl in the picture Dinah found, who her mother insists could be Sara because she's wearing the same baseball cap Sara owned.
  </p>
  <p key="174af6a9-ab6c-4dfc-861a-a8822ae7765f">
   John thinks Oliver is "scary calm" and not leading a real life at this point. Felicity calls Oliver with word that a live video is being sent around. It's the new vigilante. He questions Nichols for his crimes against the community, and then shoots him. The voice says more people will answer for their crimes.
  </p>
  <p key="8134e7ee-7bdc-4921-ad01-80d933bce614">
   Felicity is having trouble tracking the new vigilante's website. John reveals that he got into contact with an
   NSA
   friend and the code that's being use by this particular vigilante matches that of someone who called himself The Savior, and he is a former resident of the Glades. The next Savior video features an assistant district attorney,
   Gavin Carnahan
   . The Savior references his dead
   wife
   , which points Felicity to a former city worker named
   Joseph Falk

   Thea asks Laurel for advice about Roy. Laurel's advice on Roy, and bad boys in general, (despite her own streak with them) is "Run". Laurel speaks with a contact at the Chinese embassy, looking for information on the girl in the picture her parents think could be Sara. She's told the women is a citizen of the United States.

   Felicity finds The Savior's wireless signal. Oliver rushes to the scene in an attempt to save the ADA, but as soon as he gets through looking through the location, the signal has moved. He goes to the next location but can't get there in time. Felicity can't figure out why it seemed like the signal was at those locations when there was nothing there. For some reason, the Savior's signal is sending them to bogus locations. Felicity blames herself when the ADA is shot and killed, because she's the one who is supposed to take care of the technical aspect of their work.

  <p key="ad735efb-1650-43bf-b327-071170be18b4">
   Oliver returns to HQ and tries to reassure Felicity that what happened wasn't her fault. She thinks that maybe Oliver has the right idea in being alone, because she has no idea how she would explain what just happened today to a normal person.

He thinks the Savior should give Roy a second chance but he refuses. The Savior misses his first shot and the Hood kills him to save Roy.
