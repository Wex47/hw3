To atone for his mistake, H.R. used a piece of Savitar's armor to lead him to his hideout, cut Iris' leash, switch appearance with Iris to deceive Killer Frost and Savitar and ask Killer Frost for mercy to "H.R.". In any case, Iris had left a loving farewell in a video.

   When Iris as H.R. went to Infantino Street to try to stop Savitar on her own, Savitar had already killed H.R., much to her devastation. H.R. then restored his and Iris' appearances. After Barry got Savitar to S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry and Iris were willing to negate his erasure from existence, but he ultimately rejected the offer. In the forest, after Barry pushed Savitar out of his armored suit and destroyed it, Savitar went to kill Barry but Iris shot Savitar dead before he hurt her fianc√©. Then Savitar's corpse disappeared. Everyone thought the fight was over, but after H.R.'s funeral, the Speed Force began leaking energy onto Earth-1's Central City, due to the prison's vacancy. The Speed Force, appearing as "Nora Allen" told Barry to come with her. Barry then willingly entered the prison to stabilize the Speed Force, leaving Iris heartbroken.

This, therefore, ruining their honeymoon a little bit. While talking about a wedding gift given by Oliver and Felicity, Barry and Iris decided to reject the gift on the basis that Oliver and Felicity stole their moment without consulting them and that the gift, a coffee maker, was not in their wishlist.

However unknown to everyone else Barry was arrested as DeVoe's mind had managed to transfer to Dominic and had placed his old body in Barry's place with a knife embedded in it, framing Barry for murder.

   for a considerable length of time, only for a shady organization to infiltrate the company and steal a

   Iris composes a proper gathering with McCulloch's CEO,

   Iris goes to Star Labs and makes sense of who the professional killer is - Kimiyo Hoshi.

In the mean time, Iris goes up against Carver, and blames him for being the pioneer of Black Hole. Carver doesn't deny it, however blames Iris for not knowing the entire story. Iris uncovers that she's set up a dead man's switch, which will distribute every last bit of her data in the event that anybody is slaughtered.
    Before confronting him about it and knowing that he was the leader of the assassin's guild, Iris talks to

    although Iris did not see that it was Eva who took her. She saw a

    of herself acting romantically to Barry. She was trying to tell Barry that the Iris he was hugging was not her, to no avail.

  <p key="b4b8b747-2df1-40d8-a174-79101270238a">
   She was in the

   Eva McCulloch

   Iris inquires as to Eva whether she can possibly fabricate a machine to get them out of the mirror measurement. Eva chooses to be courageous, as a result of Iris' model. When it comes time to utilize the machine, Eva frenzies, and shows Iris that the machine won't work - it'll open up a gateway, yet the individual strolling through will get scorched. Eva discloses that she needed to demonstrate the machine didn't work, on the grounds that in any case Iris wouldn't confide in her. Iris later leave the room.

   After Eva's suspicious attitude, she entered to a secret room hidden in a mirror wall and realized that Eva kidnapped her and that
   Kamilla Hwang
   and
   David Singh
   were also trapped in this dimension. After this, Eva tied her to a chair and showed her Barry fighting Mirror Iris with his weakened powers. When Iris said that Eva still loved Joseph Carver, Mirror Iris stopped fighting. When

   The place was degenerating Iris' mind. It started being evident since Iris entered to the secret room. Iris filmed a video for Barry in a computer in the chance he could find her. Iris found Kamilla in
    S.T.A.R. Labs
    making experiments with the
   Lightning dagger
   to find an exit. Kamilla initially did not trust Iris out of fear she was the mirror clone that sent her to the Mirrorverse, but after Iris told her about Kamilla being one of the only people allowed to use Cisco's Chewbacca's t-shirt, both shared a hug.

Iris was broken by reflections of other parts of her life, like when she worked on CC Jitters, when she was almost killed by Savitar or her old self that dampened Nora's powers. Since Iris discovered Eva was using these reflections to break her, she got to stop her. She got an idea to get out of the Mirrorverse and sent a message to Kamilla and David to meet on the Speed Lab.

   With Barry, Cisco, and Frost gone to fight Eva, Iris joined the b-squad at comms. When Eva began to get the upper-hand, Iris realizes that brute force would not bring victory, so she uses a

Afterwards, Eva retreated to the Mirrorverse.

However, she didn't hold any ill will against her father for not telling her Francine was alive, understanding he was trying to protect her from feeling abandoned.

     Iris still hasn't learned that she can't talk Barry out of anything once his mind is made up about something throughout the entire series, despite Barry's bad experiences with Eobard Thawne and Hunter Zolomon respectively, Iris and everybody in Team Flash (except Barry) is still fooled by an individual's ability to appear kind-natured, Iris didn't suspect that
     Clifford DeVoe
     was a meta-human (even after the Council of Wells informed Team Flash that the latter was the mastermind behind the bus meta-humans) despite the fact that he did not have a criminal record, Iris's concern increased when Barry's suspicions of Clifford increased when he and his wife Marlize lied to his superior officer,
     David Singh
     , claiming that he was harassing Clifford (when in truth, he was only conducting the necessary investigation) when Iris tried to persuade Barry to let it go, he refused, even when every member of Team Flash (including Iris) believed Clifford was innocent - Barry's suspicions were proven to be correct yet again; regarding Clifford. Then when Nora West-Allen revealed that she's been working with Eobard to stop Cicada, she stubbornly refused to see the danger of working with him (despite the past numerous times that Eobard has used and manipulated everyone on Team Flash and murdered Barry's mother).

    Once getting together with and eventually marrying Barry, Iris provides both tactical and emotional support to him regarding the latter's duties as the Flash, when Cisco and Caitlin grew alienated from Barry for a time; due to the repercussions of Flashpoint, Iris stood by his side. She didn't hold Barry responsible, understanding that he didn't mean to cause so much damage to the timeline and actively tried to help him take down Savitar, Iris is also fiercely protective of her husband, as seen when Clifford and
    Marlize DeVoe
    framed Barry for Clifford's murder, she confronted Marlize about destroying their lives and threatened retribution (implying she would resort to murder if angered enough) Iris was also unwilling to trust Marlize to help them prevent the Enlightenment until seeing firsthand how Marlize regretted her actions.

     Expert hand-to-hand combatant:
    </b>
    Planning for his daughter's safety, Joe extensively taught Iris since her childhood how to defend herself. During sparring matches against Barry as children, Iris was never once hit by her friend, though it should be noted that Barry was not actually trying to hurt her. As an adult, Iris was able to knock out the much larger
    Tony Woodward
    (when not in his metal form) after he had been dazed by the Flash.
     She also showed considerable reflexes, able to dodge a sucker-punch from the
    Alchemy

    before knocking him out herself.
     Iris was also able to hold her own against and eventually subdue
    Marlize DeVoe
    after deliberately getting impaled on the latter's
     katana
     .
     She even managed to take down several
    Earth-X Nazis
    and knock out
     Peter Merkel
     with two punches.

    Iris is skilled in the use of firearms, having been taught by Joe in case of emergencies. She was able to accurately shoot off
    Dr. Light

     Iris also shot and killed
    Savitar
    to protect Barry
     and used a laser gun to defend herself from a katana-wielding Marlize.
     Iris is capable of defending herself with various types of laser guns and she has used them on many occasions such as helping Team Flash fight
