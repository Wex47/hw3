      vigilantes
      . Watching Oliver try to balance his jobs as both the mayor and also the protector of Star City, Felicity suggests he form a new team, but Oliver resists. However, when a deadly new criminal,

   Over the span of his battle, Oliver sees an enormous gadget that has various little bombs tied to it. Lonnie Machin is the perpetrator, and keeping in mind that Oliver takes him out, a man in a hockey cover attempts to incapacitate the bomb. Felicity is as of now doing it remotely, however, and Oliver throws the man to the side, berating him to remain the roads. Oliver shoots him in the knee.
