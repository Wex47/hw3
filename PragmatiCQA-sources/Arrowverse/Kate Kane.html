Having returned back to her former-self, Kate decided not to take back the mantle of Batwoman, as her successor, Ryan, has earned the right to be Batwoman. Kate decides to leave Gotham in order to find her cousin, Bruce and bring him back.

  </h4>
  <p key="ab9ba40a-5de6-4350-b880-b430239e9a8a">
   Kate Kane was born on January 26, 1990 to
   Jacob Kane
   and
   Gabi Goldstein
   , along with her twin sister,
   Beth
   in
   Gotham City
   . From an early age, she was very close to her cousin,
   Bruce Wayne
   ; who was like an older brother to her. Kate and Beth were inseparable growing up, doing everything together. The twins would often visit Bruce at
   Wayne Enterprises
   and once when they were little, Kate convinced Beth to sneak into his office. While playing in the room, Kate noticed a
   pearl necklace
   in a square pyramid-shaped glass container and tried to touch it. However, Beth stopped her and suggested they leave the office immediately.
  </p>
  <p key="e660bd88-3cca-4503-83b0-623c291e5a43">
   Kate and Beth often snuck into the abandoned
   Burnside Orphanage
   to play ouija; taking turns scaring each other.
   On Fridays after school, they would go to a waffle stand at
   Burnside Park
   to eat chocolate-covered waffles.
  </p>
  <p key="5dddaf64-7faf-4824-9c13-5da6ebc20801">
   On January 26, 2003, Kate and Beth had a Bat Mitzvah to celebrate their 13th birthday. As the party winded down and the family prepared to leave, Kate took a box of mints as a keepsake. Jacob drove home with his car full of Kate and Beth's birthday presents, so the twins planned to go with their mother. Before they left, Gabi gifted Kate and Beth garnet necklaces, their birthstones, which matched her ruby earrings, much to their delight. She asked Kate and Beth to ensure the three of them would keep one another close to their hearts as the twins grew up.
  </p>
  <p key="27dcfd6d-f772-4748-9701-5b4b09f67adf">
   While driving home with Gabi, Kate enthusiastically suggested she and Beth take a polaroid picture together to commemorate the day. Suddenly, the family's car was rammed by the
   Joker
   , who had hijacked a school bus, and they veered off the road, almost going over a bridge. However, Kate noticed Batman arrive and assured Beth they would be safe. Batman used two grappling hooks to attach the car to the bridge before leaving to deal with the Joker. As Beth tried to wake their mother, Kate quickly climbed out of the car through the broken rear window, shouting for Batman and why he was leaving so suddenly. When the bridge's pillar began to give away, Kate tried to reach for Beth's hand to pull her sister out, but the car broke away from the bridge, plunging into the cliff's river below. A horrified Kate was left on the bridge as the sole survivor, screaming for her mother and sister.

    Searching for Beth
   </span>
  </h4>
  <p key="938c856b-3a8a-407a-9ac0-a47182732570">
   This tragedy left Kate devastated and traumatized. She also started believing Batman only cared about catching the villain rather than saving innocent people, since he didn't stop to help Gabi and Beth. As Jacob began drifting away from her in his own grief, Bruce comforted Kate through her healing process.
   The whole city spent months helping Kate and Jacob search for Gabi and Beth until Gabi's body was recovered. Feeling that Beth was still alive, Kate became determined to find her sister.
  </p>
  <p key="2f68999a-0288-4137-baa0-dc3ca39a9a74">
   One night, Kate had a nightmare about the car accident and woke up yelling Beth's name. Jacob hugged her, comforting Kate. She refused to sleep in her bed, wanting to spend the night in the living room in case her sister called. Kate then made her father promise they'd never stop looking for Beth until they found her and brought her home.
  </p>
  <p key="1f6e90ef-385c-411a-a9d9-28fb0e0e86d3">
   After the search for Beth had expanded to
   Blüdhaven
   , Jacob was called by someone who claimed to be her, but it was cut short. He traced the call and traveled with Kate to its location, the
   Cartwright house
   . While Jacob spoke with the home's occupants and checked upstairs, Kate searched the basement. Noticing a mysterious door, she approached it and called out for Beth, but heard no response. Unbeknownst to her, Beth actually was inside, but had been threatened that the
   owner of the house
   would kill anyone she spoke to. Thinking that Beth wasn't there and the phone call was just a prank, Kate and Jacob despondently left.
  </p>
  <p key="68593203-37b8-462d-bf1b-8e7e1635bd47">
   One afternoon at
   Burnside Park
   , Kate was studying a map when Jacob brought her chocolate-covered waffles. However, she didn't even touch them, focused on finding Beth. Jacob replied they've been searching for months and need to take a break, but a guilt-ridden Kate confessed that Beth's fate was her fault; when the car crashed, Beth went to check on their mother while Kate left her behind in the wreckage.

In disbelief, Kate (correctly) refused to believe her sister was dead, pointing out she had already checked the farm on multiple occasions and found nothing. Jacob insisted she needed to accept the truth, to which Kate angrily called her father a "traitor" for giving up the search for Beth and stormed off.

At a hearing, Kate and Sophie were offered a chance deny the homosexual allegations against them in order to remain at Point Rock.

When Kate gets there, Alice sarcastically says how it must be broken because it was supposed to call Batman not Kate. She reminds Kate that putting on the suit hasn't changed anyone's life and that being a hero is not her strong suit, since she let Jacob declare her dead after not helping her escape from the car. Alice asks how she can get
   Dodgson

   Kate returns to Wayne Tower, only to find
   Tommy Elliot
   inside Bruce's office. Tommy then proceeds to tell her that he now has more money than Bruce, and points to a building he just bought - five stories taller than Wayne Tower. Kate asks why he's there, and Tommy says he is here to invite Bruce to his party. Kate says he isn't back, and Tommy goes onto talking about how Gotham's Dark Knight has the city swooning after a picture showed him reappearing in the streets of Gotham. Kate claims that the photo is fake because it's too grainy to tell what exactly it is. Tommy lets Kate know he finds her lack of a reaction to Batman's return shocking. After all, as Tommy points out, Batman did let Kate's mother and sister die and is surprised she isn't more upset. Kate says that she had years to process, noting that Batman also saved Tommy's mother. Changing the subject, Tommy tells her that he wanted to invite Bruce to celebrate his new acquisition, and insists that he's there. Kate says that he isn't, but agrees to leave the invitation on Bruce's desk. Luke then calls Kate to tell her that something of value has been stolen from one of Wayne Tower's secret weapons facilities. The security cameras were jammed, but he thinks it could have been Alice and her gang. On her way there, she passes the
   Gotham Gazette
   , where cops have been called since someone wrote, "Come out, come out Batman!" in red painting, and there's an effigy wearing batman's outfit was drenched in what looks like "blood". Kate witnesses this and writes to Bruce, about how in trying to be Batman, she ended up drawing out his enemies instead. She tells her cousin that she figures today is just an effigy. But she wonders what will happen when his enemies start to kill real people in order to draw him out. She confesses that the Gotham he set out to protect is now less safe because of her actions thus far.

   In the Batcave, Luke shows Kate how the Batsuit is bulletproof. He explains to her that the thieves took a prototype railgun from Wayne R&amp;D. The gun is a parallel conductor that generates a pulse of electromagnetism, thus accelerating the velocity of the projectile. It's the most lethal weapon that Bruce ever built. Luke then tells Kate that the one he was using is just a prototype used for showing Kate what the rail gun does. Luke goes onto say that it is the only gun that shoots a shot strong enough to penetrate the suit. Bruce had it built in case the suit ever fell into the wrong hands. Thus, whoever is in possession of the gun has the only gun out there that can kill Batman. However, the disruptor in Kate's gauntlet can neutralize the gun. When trying to pinpoint who could have taken it, Luke suggests that maybe Alice took the gun, but Kate suspects that Tommy Elliot might be behind it instead. She shows Luke the invitation and notes that it was for Bruce rather than her. Kate figures Tommy knows Bruce is Batman and that's why he stole the gun. Luke suggests that she put the Batsuit back on and show Tommy that Batman isn't afraid of him. He figures that Bruce built something to stop the rail gun and he'll find it, and Kate should defeat the thief. Kate warns him that if she doesn't, then she'll let down the entire city.

Sophie explains why she's there with Mary; explaining she's her security detail. Kate mouths an "I’m sorry" to Mary, to which Mary mouths back that she knows. Sophie then asks Kate why she's at the party, and Kate says that she was told to move on. They all go up to the top floor and Kate looks around for Tommy. The bartender
   Reagan
   advises her to stay at the bar and wait for Tommy here if she wants to save herself from a verbal car wash of veiled misogyny. Reagan promises that Tommy will be here, so Kate orders a beer. Tyler comes over shortly after, and in talking with Tyler, Kate realizes that Sophie hasn't told him that the two of them dated or that Sophie is into women. When Tyler leaves, Kate is impressed when Reagan talks about how Tyler married Kate's ex and he has no idea. Reagan explains that she since she started bartending before she could drink, she has become quite good at reading people. At one point, Jacob says to Kate that he is glad to have someone around who hates Tommy Elliot more than he does, even if he is one of his biggest clients for the
   Crows

   Kate eventually finds Tommy, who says that even though it took him half his life, he's finally looking down on Bruce. Kate asks why he thinks Bruce is there, and Tommy says that they're "cosmic besties". Kate casually mentions that a thief stole the rail gun and there's a hidden GPS hidden in the butt, and Wayne Security will soon track down the thief. Tommy is subsequently busted by Kate when she sees him inspecting the stolen gun, looking for the supposed GPS. She tells him that it isn't his and asks how he knows Bruce is Batman. Tommy explains that he paid a
   man
   to riddle him the answer, and says that since Bruce saved his mother, he didn't get his inheritance earlier and his mother went mad. He says that he's going to get revenge on the city's hero, and insists that Batman has to die. Tommy draws a gun and aims it at Kate, then takes out a phone and shuts down the power throughout the building. Tommy tells Kate to have Batman meet him on the roof or he drops the elevators. Kate says that Batman isn't in Gotham, and Tommy releases an elevator with catering staff in it and says that in an hour, he'll do it to people the city will actually miss if Batman doesn't meet him. Kate checks out the elevator crash site and finds the survivors. She tells one that he's going to be okay as the EMTs arrive.

   Kate then goes to the Batcave and says how this is all her fault, and asks Luke if he really thinks Bruce is coming back. Luke admits that he doesn't think so, and Kate says that maybe she's better than Batman because at least she's there. Luke fixes the suit by painting the bat symbol red for Kate's
   Batwoman suit
   . Tommy is waiting on the roof as Batwoman moves through the shadows. She finally steps out and when Tommy realizes that she's not Batman, she tells him that's the whole point. Tommy demands Batman, and calls her Batman's side piece. Luke tells her to activate the neutralizer in her glove. She does but it doesn't work, and Luke activates it remotely, but tells to stall for 30 seconds while it charges. Batwoman attacks Tommy and the two of them fight. He grabs the gun just as the neutralizer charges, and Batwoman shuts down the rail gun. However, Tommy grabs his remote and sets off a charge.

Tommy sets off the charge on the elevator Batwoman is on. She uses a grappling hook to pull herself up. She is holding for her life, and Tommy steps on her hands. He tells her to let go, but is knocked out by
   Alice
   from behind. Kate pulls herself up and points out that Alice just saved her life. Alice says that they're even now, but proceeds to stroke Kate's cheek, and notes that the red wig must be homage to the color of their birthstone. Kate says it's also to remind them where they came from. After a moment, Alice tells Kate that she couldn't wait 24 hours and figures Dodgson will die now because she couldn't stop herself from killing. Kate wonders why she saved her, and Alice says that it's because she has plans for her. When Kate grabs her and says that if she kills again she'll stop thinking of Alice as her sister, Alice says that's what she wants. Kate doesn't believe it, and Alice pulls Kate's hand away and leaves.

   As the police take Tommy away, Kate arrives and Tommy tells her to tell Bruce that he won't stop until Bruce shows his face. Kate reveals that they are taking him to Arkham Asylum, and taunts him by wishing him good luck buying his way out of that punishment. Reagan then is seen coming out and Kate asks her if she's okay. She reveals that she came over to ask her if she's into her and promises to call Kate when the former says yes.

   At some point after becoming known as "Batwoman", Kate lies in bed with Reagan, and turns off the radio. Reagan says that she kind of likes Batwoman and believes that Gotham could use a woman's touch. The two share a passionate kiss before Kate's phone rings, and she checks it to learn that Luke texted her saying that it's urgent. She tells Reagan that Luke is a co-worker and she has to go because there's a problem with the plumbing and lies that a water main broke at Wayne Tower. Reagan notes how Kate comes by her place late at night, and leaves before breakfast. As a result, she doesn't see much of her, except in small increments of time.

   Thus Kate tells her that she'll make it up to her before leaving. Kate goes to Bruce's office and meets with the
   museum
   curator,
   Roxanna
   . Roxanna thanks Kate for letting her have Martha Wayne's necklace up for display, and tells the photographer
   Margot
   to get a few more shots of it. Luke asks where Kate was, and Kate tells him that she's been seeing someone. He explains that Magpie struck again and almost killed a security guard, and Batwoman was nowhere to be seen. Luke and Kate go to the Batcave and Luke wonders what they're going to do with the imprisoned Dodgson. She says that he's not going anywhere until Dodgson tells her more about Alice's plan. However, his fever continues to spike, and he Dodgson's heart seizes up and Kate agrees that he needs an ER.

   Donning her Batwoman suit, Kate goes to Mary's clinic. Using a voice modulator, Batwoman tells Mary that she needs her help and shows her Dodgson cuffed to a bed. Mary notes that Dodgson tried to kill her, but checks his infected leg. She says that she might be able to save him, and Batwoman promises to come back for Dodgson later. Mary jokingly asks her if she doesn't have neosporin in her utility belt. She also goes onto chastise Batwoman because she actually subscribes to a code of do no harm unlike the vigilante.

   Batwoman deduces that she needs to establish the citizens' faith in Batman by capturing Magpie. Luke calls her and suggests that they use Eagle cams to find her.
   Magpie

   The next day, Kate meets with Luke and suggests that the Batarang is broken. He says that the trinkets were grenades and figures he can trace the contents to locate Magpie. Kate leaves to have lunch with Reagan. Kate and Reagan decide to go for a walk before lunch, and Reagan correctly deduces that Kate came back to Gotham because of an
   ex
   . She then points out that she used to live in an apartment that is now part of the
   Crows
   District, but she along with the previous tenants were and all forced out. So the real estate moguls got rich evicting people; not caring who they hurt in the process. Kate realizes that Reagan was evicted from her childhood home, and Reagan admits to having googled Kate. Just as Reagan is taking Kate to her mother's restaurant, Kate gets another text and says that she has to deal with an electrical fire in her cousin's building. She invites Reagan to the fundraiser at the museum and she agrees.

   Kate returns to the office and finds Luke knocked out. She realizes that Magpie took Martha's necklace, and feels guilty at not being there to protect Luke and the rest of the place. Kate and Luke talk about how Bruce's mom was killed for that necklace. Then Luke talks about how Bruce Wayne spent years looking for it in the streets. He eventually found it in an auction, and spent $1 million buying it back. Luke then says that Magpie 3D-printed the bombs using explosive ink, and suggests that Kate ask Sophie since it'd be easier for the Crows to locate it since they track magnate shipment. At the Crows HQ, Sophie wonders why Kate is on the case if Batwoman is as well, and Kate says that she doesn't trust vigilantes. After Sophie comes up with a list of explosive ink buyers, she tells Kate that she's glad she came to her and that they've always made a good team.

   At the Batcave, Luke goes through the list of ink purchasers. Kate notes that Sophie thinks that she's Batwoman, and wonders how Bruce made living a double-life so easily. Luke tells her that Bruce's life sucked; the playboy thing was a good cover for him because he could tell the same lies over and over. Eventually, Luke's search comes up with a PO Box for one of the buyers at the old Gotham Hotel. Batwoman goes there and finds Magpie's jewelry, computer, and 3D printer. She notes that the temperature in the room is rather cold when just looking at the window, she's able to see her breath. Luke figures out that if Batwoman's body temperature raises the room's temperature, it will set off a bomb. Through Luke, Kate finds out that her suit can lower Kate's body temperature to match the room and bypass the sensors in Magpie's lair. However, Luke warns her that she can't breathe otherwise the bomb in Magpie's "nest" will go off. He asks her how long she can hold her breath. She says it gets dicey after two minutes. While she works, Luke says that the Batarang was calibrated for Bruce, not Kate, because he had longer arms. But that it has since been recalibrated to match her. He then asks Batwoman to clone the computer's hard drive, and Batwoman does so and finds Magpie's stash of jewelry, including the necklace. However, she also discovers feathers and sneezes due to her allergy and then hoists herself out of the room on a grappling line as a bomb goes off.

   Batwoman later stands watch over the museum, figuring that Magpie will strike there. Luke has found schematics on Magpie's computer and is printing it since he can't decrypt them. She sees Reagan arrive and tells Luke that she has to go. Kate sees Reagan at the bar and avoids her, but first goes and hides her bag with her suit in a supply closet. Before she can approach her, Sophie comes over and says that she's working security in case Magpie shows. Reagan comes over and makes it clear that she's with Kate, and Sophie tells them to have fun after a tense and awkward moment between the three women. Roxanna comes over and Kate apologizes that the necklace was stolen. Roxanna informs her that a security guard showed up with stolen necklace. She calls everyone's attention and presents the necklace. Kate excuses herself from Reagan and calls Luke, who says that the "necklace" is a bomb that Magpie printed.

   As she goes to get her suit, Kate figures that the bomb will serve as a distraction while Magpie robs the museum. Sure enough, Magpie arrives on the scene. She is stealing jewelry when Batwoman throws a Batarang at her and misses. The thief asks if Batwoman will capture her or save the guests, and triggers a remote to set off the bomb necklace. Batwoman goes there and absorbs the blasts with her cape, and sees Magpie fleeing with the jewels. One of the pearls from the necklace lands next to a little girl, and Batwoman throws a Batarang to knock the pearl out of the girl's hand and then shields her with her cape. Due to the new calibration, Batwoman is able to catch the Batarang. Magpie takes a grappling line across the street, and Batwoman snags her line and brings Magpie down into a nearby water fountain.

   As the Crows secure the scene and take away Magpie, Kate realizes who she is; Margot, the photographer taking pictures of the necklace. Kate returns and tells Reagan that she was on a call. Reagan claims that she tried reaching out to Kate via her phone, and Kate responds that she must have been in a dead zone. Due to the contradiction between being on a call and being in a dead zone, Reagan figures that Kate is lying to her and says that she needs honesty in her relationships. Kate tells her that she's not in a place right now where she can share all of herself with someone else. She apologizes, and Reagan figures that she has a lot going on. She hopes that it makes Kate happy and walks away. Batwoman returns to the clinic and Mary says that Dodgson is stable. Mary relates what Dodgson said earlier about someone named

   Luke also goes onto say that this is good news for her since Commissioner
   Forbes
   must trust her since it seems like the Gotham City Police Department has her on speed dial. Luke also confesses to Kate that Stanton was the one who put away the guy that killed
   his dad
   in armed robbery the night of his high school graduation. They were celebrating the fact that Luke got into MIT but they ran out of ice. His dad went out, and the next thing he knows two cops are asking him to ID the body. They were waiting on him to cut the cake. Luke goes onto find a file on Medlock and confirms that he got 30 years at Blackgate Penitentiary rather than execution. He finds footage of Medlock, aka The Fist, vowing in court to kill Stanton. Due to overcrowding, Medlock was paroled a few weeks earlier. A newscast coming in is heard saying that Medlock has barricaded himself in a building with hostages.

   Donning her Batwoman suit, she heads to the building, where she meets up with Sophie, who comments on her new suit. They hear a woman scream and run up, and discover that the screaming is coming from loudspeakers. Donnelly comes in and sets off automated guns, killing him as Batwoman tackles Sophie to the floor. Sophie is hit, and calls Batwoman "Kate" before passing out. Batwoman takes Sophie to the clinic and Mary tends to her. When asked why she didn't take her to the hospital, since Sophie can afford it, she explains that the clinic was closer than a hospital and that Mary can't let Sophie leave.

   Kate returns to the Batcave and tells Luke that Sophie knows who she is. She says that she'll convince Sophie not to talk after she catches the Executioner. Kate figures that the Executioner is using methods of capital punishment to kill his victims, and Luke determines the third method Gotham has used to kill criminals is a gas chamber. There's only one warehouse in Gotham that stores the hydrogen cyanide gas. At the warehouse, Batwoman approaches a guard and says that she needs information. He tells her that no one has gone past him, and Batwoman fades back into the shadows as the guard offers to buy her a drink.

   Batwoman calls Luke, who says that they've got a report of Medlock elsewhere. Batwoman prepares to go check on Sophie, but a truck suddenly slams through the warehouse door, knocking Batwoman down, and the Executioner gets out and hacks open the chemical storage cage. He takes a canister of the hydrogen cyanide gas and gets into his truck, and drives off as Batwoman wakes up and tells Luke that the Crows have the wrong guy.

   Back at the Batcave, Luke tells Kate that the truck's license plates had mud on them, making it impossible to identify. But he remembers that the suit's carbon fiber ribbing is designed to absorb any impact, so any deformation in the fibers is recorded in the suit's data. This was originally designed to track damage caused by bullets and blunt-force trauma. As a result, he gets a partial ID on the license plate from when it hit Batwoman. The truck as it turns out belongs to a man named Bertrand Eldon, who worked at Blackgate for 20 years as their executioner.
  </p>
  <p key="6b7d2672-8bb4-4be4-b1db-234a86410b42">
   Batwoman breaks into Bertrand's home and finds no one there. She finds Bertrand's service awards, and locates the hydrogen cyanide capsules on the coffee table. There's no sign of a trap, and Luke warns her not to grab it. She does anyway and nothing happens, and she confirms that there's nothing inside but a flash drive.
  </p>
  <p key="10f00c8c-ec43-4e5e-8055-70529b0d9134">
   Kate brings the drive to the Batcave, where Luke plays the video attached to it. Eldon admits to being guilty of killing innocent people, instead calling out
   three
   corrupt
   individuals
   for being the true criminals, as Eldon never killed a rich, white, man despite killing several poor black people. Luke says that he knows racial profiling is a thing in Gotham, but also that Stanton spent countless hours with his family trying to find justice for Lucius. He warns that his father's killer could use the information to get a new trial, and Kate asks if it's still justice when there's a possibility that innocent people are behind bars. Kate finds Medlock and grapples him to a rooftop before he could be handed over to GCPD. She also throws a batarang onto a van with Eldon's confession attached to it.

   In Crows Security, Kate finds her father watching the confession. Jacob says that he doesn't believe that Judge Calverick is a fraud. He points out that Batman destroyed their lives. Kate tells Jacob that Beth became Alice because they stopped looking for her, and angrily says that Jacob gave up and blamed Batman because it was easier. She goes onto say that now an innocent man is going to pay the price for Jacob not listening then or now.

  <p key="1c4f5472-f9f3-43bc-95dd-10248df60013">
   Batwoman heads to Calverick's office, where he is burning papers. She figures that the judge is burning the fake confessions, and says that he'll get free protection at Blackgate. Calverick runs out into his courtroom and the Executioner attacks him. Batwoman grabs the Executioner's axe and tells Calverick to run. Once he does, the Executioner says that he no longer trusts the law. Batwoman tells Luke over the radio to get backup to get Calverick into protective custody. Batwoman and the Executioner fight, and he eventually gets the upper hand. Jacob and one of his men arrive and Jacob shoots the Executioner. He sends the other to sweep the building, and Jacob tells Batwoman that he doesn't see a difference between her and the Executioner.

  <p key="e56abdfd-84ef-4497-997a-7b101fbb4f9a">
   Jacob insists that he's accountable for Gotham and asks Batwoman who she's accountable to. Batwoman disarms him and they fight, and a timing device goes off on the Executioner's belt. Jacob realizes it's a dead man's switch linked to the Executioner's heartbeat. Gas pours into the room and the door seals. Luke confirms that the oxygen levels are dropping, and Jacob warns that the Executioner triggered the lockdown procedure. Batwoman asks Luke for ideas, and he says the hydrogen cyanide is flammable. However, Batwoman has to let the gas fill the room once to get full saturation. Batwoman tells Jacob to stay low to the ground, and he insists that he won't see the Bat symbol as the last thing before he dies. He says that the symbol let his family die, and Batwoman tells him to let his hatred fuel him into staying alive. Jacob explains that he has to blame the symbol because otherwise he'll have to blame himself. Batwoman ignites the gas when it reaches saturation level, and the cyanide burns off.

   Batwoman visits Mary and asks where Sophie is. Mary tells her that Sophie's boss is Mary's stepdad, and she's not going to let him shut her down. Batwoman thanks Mary for saving her life, and Mary tells her that Sophie knows who she is and is probably going to tell Jacob. Mary also reveals that she didn't ask Sophie who Batwoman was, putting Kate at ease.

   Later in Jacob's office, Kate looks over the information Jacob has on Alice. She realizes that she's been blaming Jacob for not saving Beth, but it was her as well who shared the blame for Beths circumstances as well since she was The Who crossed off the farm where Beth was all along, along with not being able to tell that Beth was behind the door of the farm. Jacob comes in and says that they're going to get Beth back and he won't ever give up. They both break into tears and Kate hugs him, knowing that she'll never be able to forgive herself if she doesn't forgive her dad first. Sophie comes in behind Jacob, exchanges looks with Kate, and leaves.

   Julia Pennyworth

   Alessandro's

   Alessandro

He initially tried to use the dress code as an excuse, but Kate caught on to his lie and stood up for her rights, forcing Alessandro to admit his homophobia. When Kate subtly made a scene by threatening to have her stepsister, Mary Hamilton, use her influence to shut down the restaurant, Alessandro agreed to let them stay.

   Back in the Batcave, Kate tended to Julia's ribs while the latter apologized for lying to her in the past. Luke revealed that a butterfly knife the police recovered from one of the murdered engineers of Hamilton Dynamics likely matched Alice's knife. Kate realized that Alice hired the Rifle to kill anyone who was connected to the coil accelerator and (incorrectly) Kate herself. Julia informed them that the SRR had tracked the Rifle to the Mediterranean, where she would be following him. Julia then said her goodbyes to Kate and Luke before leaving, also advising Kate to not make the same mistakes as Bruce and allow people to get close to her.

Kate finally finds out that the Jacob she met is not really him. As a test, she calls "Jacob" and tells him it's none of her business if he wants to go back with Catherine.

Kate tries to comfort her, but Mary in tears rejects her stepsister and asks if Alice is still worth it. Kate sadly admits that she doesn't, and Mary tells her that it's too late before she leaves. In a narrated letter to Bruce, Kate states that she chose to hope that Beth could still be saved, but it only cost Kate her family again. She is forced to accept that the sister she knew was looking at their photo as children. She then tears up the photo. Kate later visits Jacob in her cell and expresses how much she hates Alice. Jacob promises to put Alice on the floor once and for all when he leaves, to which Kate admits that she will not stop him.

   outfit
   down to its
   symbol
   . As Luke left to try to find a way to destroy the rock, Mary entered, wondering why the meeting was over so quickly without them discussing
   Tim Teslow
   's assault. Mary had researched the train attack and debriefed her sister on Teslow's biography, prompting Kate to want to talk to
   Apollo Teslow
   as Batwoman, but Mary questioned the logic of her costume change. Kate said that she can get around her father's edict, so Mary cited different instances where Jacob didn't care that Kate was his daughter and was harsh with his potential punishments. Kate, obstinate in her decision, told her sister that she wanted their father to see the
   vigilante
   Batwoman in a different light so that she can eventually tell him her secret identity.

   Hiding in the shadows, Batwoman watched as Apollo exercised by running up and down the stairs of the
   Gotham City Arena
   ; when he came near, she made herself known by commenting that his regiment made even her tired. As they conversed about Tim's past and his good traits despite how football warped him, Batwoman exited the shadows to see Tim approaching and screaming that his brother betrayed him. She told Apollo to run, but he stood watching. Meanwhile, Batwoman threw a batarang that pierced Titan's shoulder, but he shrugged off the blow as if it had not happened. The two began to fight as he swung his machetes. Titan dismissed Batwoman by throwing her down the bleachers before he crippled his brother.

   Retreating to the Batcave, Kate had her wounds fixed by Mary who had to reset her shoulder while Kate watched on multiple monitors
   Gotham City News
   as
   Dana Dewitt
   interviewed Jacob who told all watching that the Crows would apprehend Batwoman and anyone who activated the Bat-Signal, since he blamed her for the death at the train and the crippling of the athlete. Luke entered after he got a call from Julia who said that Batwoman should refrain from this battle; Mary agreed because she believed that somehow Kate had cracked ribs. Kate admitted that Titan's strength was overwhelming. Luke displayed his research that Titan was attacking all those responsible for his current mental state. Mary continued her medical opinion that Batwoman should be sidelined for a few weeks so Kate could heal; Kate protested, but she was clearly not at her best. Mary remarked that she had an idea.

  <p key="f2e2fad2-3d88-4ecc-8792-4c2711c5f3ea">
   As Mary, with a phone in her pocket, activated the Bat-Signal, Batwoman got into position; she watched as the Crows surrounded Mary and Jacob approached. When Mary handed Jacob the phone, Batwoman told Jacob that she wanted to work with him because Titan was too much for her alone. Jacob was angry that Batwoman used his daughter as bait and destroyed the phone while telling his troops to leave the roof. Batwoman listened as the father and daughter argued; then she appeared behind Jacob offering a truce. Jacob asked how they can defeat their common foe and shook her hand in agreement.

   At the arena, coach
   Kurt Donahue
   stands in the middle of the football field and waits for Titan; the Crows and Batwoman have scattered themselves throughout the stadium. Julia and Luke both give Batwoman the same message that she is the one being set up, but Batwoman assures Luke that she looked into her father's eyes and knows that he is sincerely with her. The lights go out; Batwoman switches to night-vision and sees Titan hurting Crows one-by-one. She descends on the field and tells the coach to flee; he does not hesitate. Titan and Batwoman fight with ferocity. She tries to talk to him and to remind him of his goodness, when gunshots riddle his body and he dies, to Batwoman's horror.

   A few days later, Kate flew to
   National City
   to meet with Kara over whether or not to destroy the piece of Kryptonite that the former was saving. On the flight back to Gotham, shortly before the plane was intended to land, the aircraft's engine apparently malfunctioned
   due to being constructed with a recalled part, leading to a crash-landing. Kate remained missing following the accident, though her friends and family were determined to find her.

   False Face Society

   Tommy Elliot
   (who was posing as
   Bruce Wayne
   , with the latter wanting the suit "back", and having stolen Kate's fragment of Kryptonite, which he used to shoot Ryan) with Ryan barely surviving the shot, Ryan returned the suit to Luke and Mary.
   But after saving Gotham's citizens, Ryan received Luke and Mary’s blessing to operate as Batwoman in Kate's place, at least until Kate returns, becoming the second Batwoman and part of the Bat Team in the process.

    Black Mask

   and his men for months, who thinks she is to blame for the death of
   his daughter
   . She fought his men while they were pulling her from the plane and her face was disfigured. During this time it was believed that Kate's plane crash was caused by
   Safiyah Sohail
   and that she was being held prisoner on the island of
   Coryana
   , with both Alice and the Bat-team fighting Safiyah to try to save Kate. In actuality, while Safiyah did not have her as her prisoner, she was later revealed to have been responsible for her disappearance and for Sionis' plan to capture Kate, as she was the one who gave Sionis the information about Kate's flight.
   After months of torture leading nowhere, Roman later hired
   Enigma
   to alter her memory.

   Six weeks of forced therapy and brainwashing through hypnosis took place with Kate constantly reminding her abductors that she was "Kate Kane"; meanwhile, Roman went to the grave of
   Circe Sionis
   and retrieved her family mask. Enigma told Roman that she was ready; with a phrase, Kate now believed that she was Circe, having no recollection of her true identity or her original memories, and instead having the memories and personality of Circe replace them. Roman removes his mask in front of Enigma so that Kate/Circe will not be confused and will know that "her father" is beside her. Roman then begins to lie, telling her that he save her from the fire of
   Arkham
   , and that all of her current injuries and gaps in her memories are from surviving that fire.

   As Roman covered her face with the mask, Enigma explained certain inconsistencies, such as her repaired voice-box, that did not align with the original Circe Sionis. Enigma told "Circe" not to remove her mask because her face was burnt from the fire at Arkham. Later, Circe sought out
   Batwoman
   , but instead found
   Alice
   instead who quickly revealed the
   vigilante's
   location.

   Batwoman told
   Angelique Martin
   and
   Ocean
   to run as Circe approached her; the two women fought ferociously with Circe getting the upper hand. Suddenly, she was hit by a fire-extinguisher wielded by Alice. This only caused Circe to hesitate for a moment because then she attacked Alice. Alice and Batwoman had a conversation about
   Cora Lewis
   , as Circe held Alice at knife-point; Batwoman walked away, leaving Alice to Circe's mercy.

  <p key="1b47e0ad-250b-4c83-bde7-ea42fe14b894">
   "Circe" brought Alice to the Sionis Estate, telling her father that she wanted him to decide the fate of the woman who assisted Batwoman. Originally, Roman told her to kill Alice, but, at the last moment, he changed his mind, saying that he had a job for Alice. Circe knocked Alice unconscious after staring at her for a moment, then put her in the basement.
   Circe watched as Roman tortured Alice with a fingernail extractor. Later, Alice tried to run away but Circe stopped her. When Alice woke up, she prodded Circe about her familiarity, stating that she knew of a
   girl who used to have the same vicious determination
   as her. "Circe" revealed to Alice that she was in fact that girl (or at least she believed she was), which allowed Alice to figure out the true identity of Black Mask. Alice later told Roman that she could build a new face for "Circe". When she was finished with her new face, Alice pointed out to her brainwashed sister that she was not actually Circe Sionis, as her eyes were brown as opposed to Kate's genetically-colored blue eyes. After applying the face mask to Kate, Alice recognized her sister and said she had their father's eyes.
   Circe didn't understand what she was talking about and Roman asked Alice to leave.

   Continuing the lie of rescuing his daughter, Roman had his company do further work on "Circe", having them permanently attach her new face and cosmetically remove and heal the remainder of her burn scars and injuries to complete her transformation. The work that his cosmetic company did seemingly made "Circe's" new face become an organic part of her body, with it being able to bleed, scar, and heal just as natural skin would. Roman then made commercials with Circe as his model advertising his new burn cream "Rebirth" and has put in social media that Circe was in rehab for months to explain why she has not been seen. During her workout routine, Alice and Jacob capture Circe, and take her to Crow Headquarters to hide her from Sionis. A DNA test uncovers that she truly is Kate. Ocean later arrives and presents to them a pack of Kate's things to help trigger her memory. Circe doesn't move, until Alice offers her a mug she made her when Kate attempted to come out to her as a kid. That triggers Circe into imagining youthful Kate secured in a similar shelter Alice was in, with Alice using this to try to jog more of Kate's memories to the surface. As Jacob informs Mary of that Kate is in fact alive, Tatiana and individuals from False Face appear and attack Jacob.

As Ryan, Sophie, and Mary try to find out more about what has happened, Circe is set off into another vision, of a youthful Kate being assaulted by Circe in the same shelter Alice was once in. Circe then assaults Mary, who takes her out with a narcotic. They understand that Kate and Circe's personalities are fighting for control over her mind and body, and that Alice is fundamental in opening Kate's memories, and erasing Circe's and that they may have to make an exchange with Safiyah, and give her the Desert Rose to get Alice back.

     Even as a child, Kate was proving to be short-sighted, as she believed that her cousin,
      Bruce Wayne
      (under the persona of Batman) didn't care about saving her mother,
      Gabi Goldstein
      and her twin sister,
      Beth Kane
      from the car that was hanging from a bridge, after he had secured it with one of his grappling hooks, completely disregarding the fact that the Dark Knight had to go and save the school children from the
      Joker
      , as he could not be in 2 places simultaneously, something she didn't realise; until after she had discovered that Bruce is Batman.
    </p>
    <p key="9e025661-f427-4d82-a3b2-933146965df7">
     Even during Kate's youth, it is implied that she was already aware of her queerness and was fine with it; she was often seen garbed in rather boyish attires, like the suit and tie she wore just before the crash, that separated her from her twin and killed their mother, took place and will carry this on as a habit of wearing "masculine clothing", for the rest of her maturing years to follow.
    </p>
    <p key="cece1e53-c012-42c7-b355-a7ca8e2b1ec7">
     As an adult, Kate is fearless, passionate and reckless, her fearless and passionate traits also makes her blind to reality; for example, a week before Kate could graduates from
      Point Rock Academy
      , she and then-girlfriend,
      Sophie Moore
      got caught violating the academy's strict code of conduct against homosexuality, she was given a choice, deny the homosexual allegations against her or get expelled, Kate believed that because she was the academy's top cadet (along with Sophie) she would not get expelled by the tribunal, as she refused to deny the allegations against her; regarding her sexuality. Unfortunately, Kate finds out the hard way that she was wrong; as she was ultimately expelled from Point Rock Academy.
    </p>
    Kate is similar to her cousin, Bruce; as she is a no-nonsense and blunt individual. She is very open with her personal opinion and proud of her sexuality.
   </div>
   <div class="wds-tab__content" key="f04e7dce-383d-4d4e-a48e-0d96d36f7cd9">
    <p key="04ee278b-ff7f-4bfb-9719-887a2edc7179">
     As Batwoman, Kate is very stoic and committed to helping
      Gotham City
      . While mostly an antisocial individual, she can give respect to those she thinks deserves it, as she acknowledged
      Supergirl
      's worth as a hero.
    </p>
    <p key="0a0a8721-ff91-492c-9d45-95c246091789">
     Kate is proven to have good morals; for example, when her twin sister,
      Beth Kane
      had informed Kate that her step-mother and mother-figure,
      Catherine Hamilton
      had paid the coroner to fake the DNA test over some skull fragments of a deer found by some of her men to make it match Beth's, causing the entire city to stop searching for her sister, Kate was completely enraged and disgusted to the point that she disowned Catherine for good, as she cannot be associated with an immoral individual, who was indirectly responsible for Beth becoming the sociopath she is today, souring her relationship with Mary in the process.
    </p>
    <p key="cfa69c2d-af31-444a-951b-b76a213144d9">
     Although Kate hated Catherine for playing god with her family's lives, this did not mean that she wanted her dead, when Beth had killed her soon to be ex-step-mother and framed their father,
      Jacob Kane
      for it, she was furious at what her twin sister had done, as she was filled with grief over her step-mother's murder, more likely she's downhearted to know that her sister could do something so horrible to their father, however, despite this, she has not truly forgiven Catherine for her despicable actions and obviously never will. Most likely she despises her even more, after learning the full extent of the trauma Beth had to endure for more than a decade; due to a part to Catherine's manipulations.
    </p>
    <p key="1bc4d398-9dac-4da6-ad17-e4fdfebf8838">
     However, Kate later crossed the moral line herself when she killed
      August Cartwright
      , the very individual directly responsible for Beth becoming the murdering sociopath she is today, after he revealed that he had desecrated her mother,
      Gabi Kane
      's corpse keeping her severed head, proving that she is not as moral as her cousin,
      Bruce Wayne
      ; the latter who will never intentionally take his enemies' lives, regardless of the circumstance. At least that is what she believed until she learned from
      Luke Fox
      that Bruce killed his greatest enemy, the
      Joker
      .
    </p>
    <p key="ea4a372c-509c-4816-b564-dfb3a9dc8b20">
     After Kate killed August, it is very likely that she can no longer be angry with her twin sister, Beth; regarding Catherine's murder, after Kate crossed a moral line herself and also realizing that deep down, despite everything she had done, she still clearly cared for Beth and never stopped loving her sister, as she also realized that it was wrong for her to choose to save
      Earth-TUD14
      Beth Kane
      's life instead of her Beth's life; regarding them both dying from neurological degeneration, no matter how angry she was with twin sister; regarding Catherine's murder and framing their father, Jacob for it.
    </p>
    <p key="05efc725-08c5-4987-9a62-3db55dfd0e7a">
     But this did not stop Kate from (regretfully) betraying Beth and leaving her in
      Arkham
      so that she can get help, but also because Kate wanted to preserve whatever morality she has left inside of her. However, this act of betrayal led to the deaths and torture of many of Gotham's citizens; such as Arkham's late warden Dr.
      Butler
      .
    </p>
    <p key="73e16b97-1f4f-44b6-a9c3-bb8397de5b5e">
     Kate is extremely overconfident; to the point of having a massive ego; which is her greatest flaw, this was a by-product of exonerating herself for her twin sister, Beth's tragic past, instead resulting in a co-dependant arch-rivalry; similar to that of Bruce's arch-rivalry with the Joker.
    </p>
    <p key="3b41bc1f-bd30-462c-ad4e-c0379dd6b196">
     After being freed from the late
     Evelyn Rhyme
     's brainwashing; Kate has reverted to her original personality, she has also become far more humble and modest; as evidenced by the fact that Kate did not take back the mantle of "Batwoman"; as her successor,
      Ryan Wilder
      has proved herself worthy of being Batwoman.
    </p>
    Despite all her positive traits, it's evident from experience that she isn't sister material as concluded from Beth and Mary's conversation; that Kate would have had Mary locked up in Arkham like she did to Alice (after getting infected by
     Pamela Isley's vines
     ). Mary has begun seeing Beth as more of a sister than Kate ever was to her, vice versa as well.

     After Kate was brainwashed by the late
     Evelyn Rhyme
     into believing that she was the late
      Circe Sionis
      ; she become cold, cruel, sadistic, ruthless and sociopathic, similar to her twin sister,
      Beth Kane
      ; but to a far greater extent. She also became bloodthirsty; as she wanting to kill
      Angelique Martin
      and
      Ocean
      for their betrayal.
    </p>
    <p key="77961899-e770-4a03-b225-084f032de7ba">
     But unlike Beth; Kate lacks any form of empathy, compassion, sympathy and remorse. She mocked
      Sophie Moore
      ; saying that lying to her was the easiest thing she had ever done.
    </p>
    Kate is quite arrogant and egotistical; to the point of being delusional; for example, she thanked
    <a href="Roman Sionis.html" key="8c34a0fe-3860-4038-b4dd-7072d1410978" title="Roman Sionis">

     Peak of human physical condition:
    </b>
    As a vigilante, former soccer athlete
     and a former top cadet of
     Point Rock Academy
     (alongside
     Sophie Moore
     ) Kate is in top physical condition; she is strong enough to throw her enemies into the air and quickly master opponents much larger than her with relative ease. Due to five years of brutal combat and survival training under various conditions; Kate is remarkably resilient to cold temperatures, having no qualms in free diving with no protection in icy waters. Her physical strength seems to be even a bit inhuman, as Kate has little to no difficulty at all in lifting and throwing around full-grown men. She was strong enough to punch through ice from underwater using handcuffs, kick open the boarded-up doors to
     Bruce Wayne
     's office,
     break a metal staff over her knee and kick down
     Reagan
     's double-locked door.
     She is fast enough to exit a room unnoticed, not dissimilar to her cousin. Kate also has a high level of stamina as by her own admission, she can hold her breath for two minutes, but it gets "dicey" after two minutes pass.
     Her reflexes allowed her to catch
     Beth Kane
     's knife before it could hit the latter's
     doppelgänger
     ,
     as well as dodge her own
     grappling gun
     's hook. Kate's father,
     Jacob Kane
     offered her the opportunity to join the
     Crows
     , putting her on par with former Navy SEALs and Green Berets.
