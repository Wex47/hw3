   Ray was meeting a client at his desk at an apartment company. The woman told about how her family was evicted from their own apartment - only them, because of being Muslim. Terrill promised to investigate, telling the woman not to pack yet, which made her much cheer. During recess, Ray prepared a speech for a conference in front of his friend John. The man was much nervous despite the fact that John told him to relax. After a moment, Jenny entered the room and told her friends to get ready. Before Terrill got the speech right, one of the entrepreneurs interrupted him and revealed that the company would close soon, banning Jenny, John, and Ray. The reason was property losses, which could lead to serious tax cuts. Therefore, it was only profitable to suspend operations. After the conference, Terrill and Trujillo went to a nearby bar to drown their sorrows in alcohol. John decided to change the subject after seeing one of the clients staring at his friend. The man was amazed that Ray still did not reveal his sexuality to his parents, but he still wanted Ray to have fun, ordering him to speak to the client watching him. But Ray wasn't ready to flirt for professional reasons, so he decided to head home. During the meal together, the parents started asking Ray about the girl he was working with, Jenny, without realizing that their son was gay. Wanting to quickly change the subject, Ray spoke about the collapse of the company he worked for. To everyone's surprise, this pleased Robert, who thought it was time for his son to take up serious work, such as that of his brother. After the meal, Terrill went outside to talk to John on the phone. The conversation was interrupted by a gigantic
   breach
   that appeared on his lawn, and a
   mysterious individual
   emerged from it. Seeing his wounds, Terrill intended to help, but Terrill disagreed, showing a face identical to his. He handed him the core then turned into solar energy and irradiated Ray cells, confusing the boy.

   After the last experiences, Ray went to John, to whom he told about everything - noting the existence of a double. John, however, did not believe his friend, considering his story to be invented and unsupported by evidence. When Terrill showed him the secret core, the man still didn't believe him, until the device was accidentally activated. The friends got scared and ran away from him, and finally a
   hologram
   of a
   robot
   's stature appeared.
   Red Torando
   's hologram quickly noticed that he was on
   Earth-1
   and introduced the male theory of the multiverse, noting that he came from the cruel world of
   Earth-X
   . He told a story that distinguishes both worlds from each other, adding information about a group of fighters called
   Freedom Fighters
   , as well as their enemies in the
   New Reich
   . Terrill's task was to destroy the core that contained secret information that would not fall into enemy hands. Ray, however, did not intend to destroy the device, which resulted in a small argument between the friends, during which the boy unknowingly activated his abilities and put on
   a suit
   . It was then that John realized that when a double from another world exploded, he gave Terrill his abilities, which the men, after a short discussion, decided to test by destroying John's apartment.

   Ray practiced shooting light rays at geese, which he didn't do very well. John started joking that the friend would only be fit for fireworks displays for the holidays. After a short discussion, Terrill decided to practice flying again, discovering a new ability that he showed his friend right after landing. For he could manipulate light to such an extent that his body was invisible. Hours later, Ray and John returned to the bar, where Trujillo was finally going to convince his friend to meet
   the boy
   watching him. Terrill finally gave in and scared the boy away from the table with his abilities, giving himself the opportunity to talk to him alone. Ray spoke to him, learning his name and starting a long chat that led them both towards the park. Suddenly, the men heard a woman's scream, immediately running towards it and noticing the robbery. Terrill ordered a friend to escape while he would deal with the criminal as The Ray. As everything went smoothly and quickly, the hero took advantage of the situation and hung the thief on a street lamp, where he waited for the arrival of the officers.

   The next day, two criminals were robbing a bank when the alarm went off unexpectedly. The thieves did not care about him, as they knew perfectly well that the police would not arrive on time. Suddenly, The Ray appeared and forced the criminals to surrender. His confidence, however, failed, as he failed to see the third criminal who managed to shoot the hero in the shoulder. Thus, Ray found himself trapped, but he used his wits to force his enemies to shoot himself. As soon as he heard the police sirens, he immediately left the building and returned home, where he began treating the bullet wound in the bathroom. When Robert noticed the bloody bandages, the man, in order to impress his father, lied that he was playing basketball and injured himself slightly.
   The family
   conversation was interrupted by a call from
   Jacob
   , which Terrill went to answer outside. They both made an appointment when Ray was hit by a tranquilizer dart, causing him to weaken, eventually falling to the ground. He tried to open his eyes with the last of his strength, noticing the stature of the two people staring at him.

   While at the camp, Ray interacted with a number of heroes from Earth-1, their origins unbeknownst to him. When a
   Sturmbannf√ºhrer
   came to do a check, the heroes and Ray were pulled out of the area to be executed. On their way, some of the Earth-1 heroes attempted to escape but were stopped by shocks from their power-dampening collar. They continued on, but before they could be shot, Leo intervened, breaking Ray's collar and allowing him to use his powers to let them escape. They returned to the base of operations of the
   Freedom Fighters
   , where Ray was brought up to speed on who they were and their abilities. He introduced them to General
   Winn Schott
   , who told them of their plans to blow up a gateway to Earth-1.
   Alex Danvers
   attempted to argue, wishing to return home and help their friends, but Schott's mind was decided, a fact Ray tried to assure her. Ray and Leo left to their quarters, where the former questioned why the latter was so adamant about helping the heroes, eventually coming round to the idea. They suited up, before going to talk to General Schott. After some arguing, he agreed to give them some time, an hour. They discussed a game plan, before heading for the hangar.

   The heroes arrived at just the right time, the Ray and

   , discussing their course of action, as

   . The heroes soon after took to the streets, where the Ray flew around taking out Nazis. After the threat was eliminated, the Ray watched on as
   Steel
   caught
   Supergirl
   after falling from space. Following the ordeal, Ray decided to return home, albeit without Leo, who decided to hang around for a bit before returning to Earth-X.
