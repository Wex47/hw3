   Henry Goodwin

When the search team discovered that C2 explosives had been placed into the ship's hull, Moira realized the sinking wasn't an accident and ordered the team to investigate for any forensic evidence. When one of the workers tried to call Malcolm, Moira's bodyguard caught him. The man refused to say anything under interrogation, but Moira had her suspicions confirmed. Moira decided to shoot the worker dead, but couldn't bring herself to pull the trigger, so her bodyguard did it himself. Unbeknownst to them, the captain of the ship had called Malcolm and revealed Moira knew about the bomb.
   Malcolm subsequently forced Moira to aid him in The Undertaking scheme by threatening her and Thea, and she reluctantly agreed.

   Upon hearing of a vigilante targeting the wealthy in the city, Moira was especially worried for her family's safety. In court when her son was legally resurrected, she became distressed as Oliver recounted his presumed death. Afterwards, Moira was eager for her son to tour

   The next day, Walter and Moira gave Oliver a tour of Queen Consolidated, with Moira insisting that he follow in Robert's footsteps and take a leading position at the company. However, Oliver refused, prompting a brief argument over his legacy as Robert's son and leaving Moira disappointed. She attended the opening of the
   Robert Queen Applied Sciences Center

   When Thea was arrested for breaking into a store and underage drinking, Moira was called out by Oliver for enabling her daughter by not disciplining Thea enough over her mistakes, just as she had done with him. This prompted Moira to draw the line, starting with grounding Thea for two weeks. A couple days later, Moira sat down with Thea and talked about Robert, something she hadn't done in years since his death. Moira acknowledged that she and her daughter have both have fallen into "bad habits", but expressed her belief that things could still change. That night, Moira and Walter attended the
   Unidac Industries

Walter explained he was dealing with a disappearance of $2.6 million from a subsidiary, slightly alarming Moira. That night, she attempted to prevent her husband from continuing to pursue the money trail by claiming she authorized the withdrawal to invest in a friend's start-up back in 2009, which seemingly placated him. Later, Moira met with Malcolm, who revealed to her that the vigilante isn't just going after the rich, but specifically targeting those on "

   When Thea began making increasingly morally dubious choices as Oliver's chief of staff to protect his identity and mayoral career, including slander and blackmail, Oliver warned her that she was becoming just like Moira, who had committed similar acts in the name of protecting her children. Upon realizing this, Thea decided to resign and leave the city for some time.
