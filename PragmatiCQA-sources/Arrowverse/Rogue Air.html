Barry then gets a call from Cisco, and goes to STAR Labs. At the Labs, Cisco illuminates the group that Wells' wheelchair shrouded an a cutting edge power source. He induces that the source acted like a battery, charging Well's speed at whatever point he sat in it. At that point, the group understands Wells' vitality signature profound inside STAR's storm cellar. Joe, Cisco, and Barry go to examine.

Eddie depicts the "cutting edge tube" that Wells was growing underground, and how it was the "key" to Well's arrival to what's to come. Cisco at that point distinguishes the cylinder as a cutting edge power source that will re-power the atom smasher. The force source will arrive at its full force in 36 hours, and will reignite the atom smasher at that point. The gathering realizes that the quickening agent's vitality will execute the metahumans put away in STARR Labs, and chooses to send them to the jail island of Lian-Yu, where they'll be protected. Barry says he'll require Joe's assistance in shipping the metahumans.

   Joe goes to his manager at Central City's Police Department and approaches her to clear the streets for the metahuman's shipment. She says she can't get included, refering to the various laws that Joe and group have broken by detaining the metahumans without fair treatment. Barry meets with Joe and says that ARGUS can help transport the metahumans to Lian Yu, however they despite everything need prompt help in Starling City. Without CCPD down and out, Barry concludes that the main man he can go to is Captain Cold.

Before Joe can additionally dissent, Flash races to the CCPD and carefully eradicates each document on Snart. He at that point carries all physical proof to Snart, who devastates it with his Cold Gun. At that point Snart's sister, Golden Glider, shows up, and the group up authoritatively starts.

   Barry takes Cold and Glider back to STAR Labs. Cold reveals to Joe that he can be trusted, while Glider takes a stab at playing with Cisco once more. Cisco is enticed by her charms, yet stands up to. Cisco at that point shows how they'll get the Metahumans out—by means of a business 18-wheeler that has been retrofitted with Wells' mystery power source. Cisco figured out it so that as opposed to driving the metahumans, the source will debilitate them. In the wake of thumping the metahumans out with gas, the posse ships them across town. Sadly, the metahuman detainees wake up in-travel.

   Inside the truck, the force damper changes and the metahumans recover they controls. They break out of the truck and assault Flash, the pack, and Cold. An enormous fight follows. The Rogues nearly slaughter The Flash, yet Captain Cold and Glider even the tides. Cold says that they should simply consider the night a "draw," and permits them to get away. Presently obliged to Snart, the detainees escape. Flash is at that point understands that Cold fixed the force damper and made the circumstance advantageous for him.

   Back at STAR Labs, Barry faults himself for trusting Snart. He looks at himself to the Arrow, saying that Oliver Queen could have facilitated the circumstance. Joe reveals to Barry that he's not the Arrow, and he knows not to go too far among good and bad. Joe makes Barry guarantee to stroll along the clouded side, and Barry concurs.

   At the CCPD, Iris reveals to Eddie that in spite of what Wells stated, she will keep on adoring him.

   Wells puts on his Reverse Flash uniform, and a huge super-controlled battle ejects. Bolt hits Reverse Flash with a nanite-fueled bolt, which quickly depletes Reverse Flash of his speed. From that point, Arrow and Reserve Flash enter a typical road brawl. Reverse Flash rapidly recovers his forces and nearly murders Arrow, yet Barry stops him. Flash at that point baits Reverse Flash to an atomic impact from Firestorm. With Reverse Flash paralyzed, Arrow hits him with another nanite-controlled Arrow. With his forces by and by gone, the Reverse Flash falls and is at last crushed.
