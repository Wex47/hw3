   reports that they found an old bottle with mobile phone in it. The message contains a message from Ray saying that he has been kidnapped by
   Damien
   and
   Nora
   Darhk, and to not try to find him because the Darhks will kill him. It's revealed he is being tortured. The Darhks are attempting to get the
   spirit totem
   to work but they are unable to.
   Kuasa
   says that the totem should be hers, but Nora disagrees, pointing out that she already carries the water totem. Kuasa tells her that until Nora can find a selfless reason for wielding the spirit totem, Amaya's link to it will remain stronger than hers, and Nora will not be able to use it. Damien asks about the broken
   fire totem
   they have. Kuasa flinches from it, admitting that she's afraid of it because it killed her once. Damien wants to know if it can be mended. Kuasa says that only a brilliant mind could work out how to do so. They realise that they are have Ray prisoner.

   Back at UpSwipz Ray has been analysing the shards of the fire totem. He tells the Darhks that it can't be repaired without using all the energy released in the Big Bang – that is unless someone has managed to invent cold fusion, which Ray thinks is impossible. Damien tells Ray that cold fusion was invented in East Berlin in 1962 by a scientist named
   Bernhardt Vogel
   . Ray says that if it had been he would have heard about it. Damien reveals that the reason no-one knows about it was that he was hired by the fossil fuel industry to kill Vogel and stop his research from getting out. Damien decides to go back to 1962 to stop his younger self from killing Vogel. Nora points out that if younger Damien sees his future self, it could change his timeline, and says she will go instead. Damien says that it is too dangerous for her to go. Nora manages to convince him that she's capable, and insists on taking Ray, so that there is someone who "speaks nerd" who Vogel will trust.

   East Berlin, 1962: Nora and Ray use the
   time stone
   to teleport to the apartment in the safe house where Vogel is being kept and tell him that they are CIA agents, there to take him to America. Vogel tells them that he wants to go to West Berlin, and that he won't tell them anything about cold fusion until he is reunited with his family. When Ray and Nora stop Vogel from trying to get a doll that he plans to give to his daughter, he shouts for help and an East German agent enters. Nora tries to disable him using her magic, but it doesn't work, because Ray shot her with his anti-magic gun. Ray is able to knock the guard out, but others storm in. Outside the younger Damien Darhk is killing all of the East German guards, on his way to kill Vogel, whilst inside the safe house Ray and Nora are able to take out the agents in the flat. Younger Damien hears the sound of the fighting inside the apartment and shoots the rest of the guards through the door. Ray and Nora try to time jump out with Vogel, but Damien shoots the time stone, breaking it. Without an exit, Nora, Ray, and Vogel climb out of the window of the apartment and are able to jump into the back of a passing truck. When the truck stops, Nora threatens to torture the formula for cold fusion out of Dr. Vogel. Vogel tells her to do her worst, as the pain of being separated from his family and possibly never seeing them again is worse than anything she could do to him, and she relents. Nora worries that her father will think she's a failure. Ray tells her that she needs to show him what she is really capable of. They decide they're going to try and smuggle Vogel across the border into West Berlin, one of the most heavily guarded borders in history. They head to the headquarters of a forger who can make them false papers. The forger isn't there, so they make their own. They are also able to obtain a car, and new clothes so that they can get themselves into West Berlin.

   Back in 2018 the older Damien Darhk is worrying about why Nora and Ray are not back yet, and travels back to 1962 to find them.

   At the border Nora is able to convince the guards to let them cross. Unbeknownst to them the younger Darhk is targetting them with a sniper rifle. Before he can shoot however the East German guards are picked up and thrown through the air by magic. Nora realises her father (the older Damien) is there. They retreat back into East Berlin. Back at the forger's headquarters, Nora tells Damien that she had things under control until he showed up. Damien says that they are going to take Vogel back to 2018 and torture him until he gives up his cold fusion formula. Nora tells him that torture will not work, as the secret is the only way he will see his daughter again – and unlike Damien, Vogel is a father who cares about his child. Damien tells her that he's only had her best interests at heart, but Nora points out that when she was a child Damien had her possessed by a demon so that he could come back to life. Damien realises that Ray has been a good influence on hear and tries to kill him. Nora calls him a selfish man-child and leaves.

   On the Waverider, Ava returns from the Time Bureau and tells Sara that they have been unable to find Ray. Everything the Legends have been trying to do have similarly proved useless so far. Amaya and Zari meanwhile have made it to the

   In 1962 Nora runs in to the younger version of Damien. Meanwhile the older Darhk is trying to work out what happened to Nora – that she used to be a little girl and in the blink of an eye she's all grown up and doesn't need him any more. Ray tells him that if he really cared for her he wouldn't have let her be a vessel for Mallus. Damien says that he wanted destroying to world to be his gift to her, not her career path. Ray suggests he tells her how he feels, and that Nora is doing her best to try and impress him. Damien confesses how proud he is of Nora, but Ray tells him that she doesn't know that. At that moment the telephone rings. The younger Damien has captured Nora and is offering an exchange – her life for Vogel's. Older Damien ties Ray up and goes to meet his younger self, taking Vogel with him.

   In the world between worlds Zari suggest that they leave. Amaya says that she can feel her totem everywhere, but that it feels different. Zari's air totem starts to glow, and
   Amaya's ancestor
   approaches. She tells Amaya that the longer her totem is in the possession of darkness, the more the world between worlds will be corrupted. Her ancestor says that she is trying to fight the evil, but she cannot resist for ever. Amaya promises that she will get her totem back. Her ancestor tells her that she needs to get Kuasa back as well as soon they will need her. She tells Amaya and Zari that the first totem bearers imprisoned a great evil, who cannot be allowed to break free. Zari asks if she is referring to Mallus and the ground shakes. The ancestor tells them that Mallus is imprisoned by time, and the more that time is broken, the closer he gets to breaking free. Amaya realises that this is the reason that Damien Darhk and his allies are creating anachronisms. The ancestor tells her that if they do not stop Darhk, then all of time is at risk.

   Back in East Berlin older Damien (wearing a mask so younger Darhk does not recognise him) has arrived at the rendezvous to exchange Vogel for Nora. The younger Darhk shoots Vogel and then throws Nora off the rooftop they are meeting on. Older Damien is able to use magic to stop her falling. As he's distracted the younger Damien tries to shoot him, but the older version is able to stop the bullets magically. Young Damien then attacks his older self, preventing him from saving his daughter. Back at the forger's headquarters, Ray notices that Darhk has left his
   A.T.O.M. suit
   behind and is able to activate it and free himself. On the rooftop, younger Damien is strangling older Damien. Nora tells him that he must let her go so that he can save himself. Damien lets her fall, but she rises back up. The spirit totem has activated because of her selfless her act of sacrifice. She is able to knock the younger Darkh out. In the world between worlds, the ancestor tells Amaya and Zari that Nora has managed to claim the totem's power, and that they must run. Then she vanishes. Back on the rooftop East German guards arrive. Damien and Nora fight them. As they are doing so Ray also arrives, and tells a wounded Vogel that they must leave. Vogel says that it is too late, but gives Ray the doll. Ray tells him that he should give it to his daughter himself, but Vogel tells him the doll never belonged to her – it really contains all his information about cold fusion. As Ray picks up Vogel so that they can leave, the older Darhk kills him. Ray tries to fly away, but Nora, channelling the

   . This causes an aberration in time that causes a time quake, which is picked up by the Waverider. They realises that Ray is the source. However the time quake has also caused tears in the fabric of time itself. The Waverider jumps to East Berlin, and Wally is able to speed Ray away.

   Back on the Waverider Ray shows them the formula for cold fusion and tells them that Damien Darhk needed it to repair the fire totem, and suggests that they go and get it. Wally reveals that he stole it out of Darhk's pocket. Amaya and Zari return from their vision quest to tell the rest of the Legends about what they learned – that time is being destroyed so that Mallus can be freed. Rip suggests they contact the Time Bureau to tell them what they've learned. Director Bennett insists they place Rip under arrest. Before the Legends are able to tell Bennett what they've learned,
   Grodd
   appears and kills him. Rip tells Ava that she is now the highest ranking official at the Bureau and that she is now in charge of it. Ava reinstates Rip to the Time Bureau. Nate and Ray discuss his adventures, and Ray defends Nora. Nate asks if Ray has the hots for her – Ray doesn't deny it, and says that maybe there is hope for her. Sara catches up with Wally and asks if he's planning to stay. Wally says he was thinking of joining Rip at the Time Bureau, as it seems like the team doesn't like him. Sara tells him that none of them got on with each other when they first arrived. Ava and Rip come to take their leave. Ava portals back to the Time Bureau. Before he leaves Rip orders Gideon to delete a file concerning Director Sharpe, saying that Sara can never find out the truth about Ava.
