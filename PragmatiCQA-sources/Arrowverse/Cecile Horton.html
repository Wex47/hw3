   After Scudder and Dillon were apprehended by the Flash and

   Cisco Ramon

   After Cecile and Joe returned home from training for the Central City Marathon, Cecile accidentally told Joe she loves him, throwing him off. Later at work, Cecile apologized if her slip-up made Joe feel pressured to say "I love you" back, but he assured her it was fine. That night, Cecile visited Joe at home when he didn't answer her texts, asking what's been going on with him lately. Joe simply stated that part of his life was complicated and he didn't feel ready to share it with her, believing they should break up. Heartbroken, Cecile left in tears. Just then, she was captured by
   Killer Frost
   , who demanded
   Tracy Brand
   , the only person who could stop
   Savitar

   Cecile later met Joe at the precinct, assuring him her kidnapping wasn't his fault and stated he should've just been honest with her. Joe apologized for lying to her and told Cecile he loves her too, much to her joy. He then revealed to Cecile of Barry and Wally's secret identities and his work with
   Team Flash

   Cecile was prosecuting arsonist
   Lucious Coolidge

   Hankerson
   . Since Barry was the CSI officer assigned to the case, Cecile needed him to testify in court to hold Coolidge for trial. She called Joe, informing him she urgently needed Barry at the CCPD. However, Barry didn't appear to remember Cecile or that he was the Flash. Joe explained that Barry was dealing with amnesia after a failed experiment by Team Flash, much to Cecile's dismay.

  <p key="e1dc7bfd-4536-42c5-a61b-24249f052575">
   Cecile and Joe were unable to stall the hearing. That afternoon, Cecile attempted to work with Barry's memory problem by questioning him as the latter used special glasses designed by Cisco and

   Cecile had
   Harry Wells
   make her a mental activity dampener, which helped to create the

  <p key="1e3dc43c-12dc-4ddc-bfb7-3a38973c82cf">
   After Harry lost his intelligence by overloading his thinking cap, Joe asked him to distract her for a while. Harry and Cecile discovered together that Harry would lose all his knowledge with time, but Cecile could read Harry's ideas so Team Flash learned that DeVoe's plan was to strip everyone of their intelligence.

   When DeVoe launched the satellites to start the Enlightenment (the name of his plan), Iris encouraged Marlize to help them to stop said plan. After all of them went to the pocket dimension, Marlize insisted that the only way to stop DeVoe was to enter his mind, and Cecile with the cerebral inhibitor was part of the entrance there. Barry was put in the
   hoverchair
   and wore the cerebral link helmet to enter them. The problem was that if Cecile gave birth, she may lose her powers, and Barry might be trapped inside DeVoe's mind forever.

   When DeVoe arrived for them, he used Null's powers on them all except Joe, and after failing to make Joe shoot himself, DeVoe started to choke Cecile although she was pregnant. Since Barry and Ralph left the portal, DeVoe was losing Ralph's possessed body and all his powers ceased blocking Team Flash and Marlize. Ralph recovered control of his body, but DeVoe sent himself to the hoverchair with Kilg%re's powers. When Marlize unplugged his program, DeVoe made the satellite Sally fall to Central City.

   Right after Barry and

   destroyed the satellite, Cecile gave birth to her daughter,
   Jenna Marie West
   on May 22, 2018. The baby was received with a party at the West House. However, the Mystery Girl goes to the West house, where she introduces herself as
   Nora West-Allen

    Cecile's mother
    got sick and was diagnosed with cancer. Cecile was in court and she got the call that her mother had died. Feeling extreme guilt that she had not been there for her mother and thus that her mother had died alone, Cecile fell into depression and eventually ended up at St. Carmine's Psychiatric Hospital, where she wandered the halls and stayed awake at night thinking about her mother. When Cecile left the hospital, she forced herself to "toughen up" and act like none of this had happened, but it still haunted her every day for the following decades.

   In November of 2021, Cecile's memory was rewritten along with the rest of Team Flash when Eobard Thawne rewrote the events of May with the
    Negative Still Force
    to make it seem like Joe had been killed accidentally by a train. Since Barry would be unaffacted, it played into the plan to make it seem like he was going crazy.

   Despite Iris later finding proof that Joe vanished before the train ever hit him, Cecile was still convinced Barry had gone crazy from the "evidence" of not remembering Joe died, losing his job at CCPD and S.T.A.R. Labs getting condemned making him snap. Cecile coerced Top to help track him down; only for Despero to hijack their attempt. Cecile drove him off, but not before he learned Barry was at the
    Hall of Justice
