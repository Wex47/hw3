   In early 2015, seeking to take over
   The Glades
   , Brick orchestrated the theft of evidence against criminals still awaiting trial to have them released from lack of evidence and to join his crew. When confronting one of his men who shot a cop stealing schematics of the evidence locker, Brick gave the man a choice to shoot him or be killed, but Brick beat him to death anyway. Later, Brick and his men stormed the building to steal the evidence, despite resistance from

   and Arsenal, and got away. He also employed unknown means to survive a head-shot. All the criminals incarcerated based on the evidence he stole were released and Brick forced them into his gang, threatening to send it to the D.A. if they refused, and informed them of his plan to seize the Glades.

   were present. Brick ordered the Mayor and the aldermen be brought with them but to kill the rest. His men only succeeded in taking the aldermen as everyone else fought back. Brick later contacted Mayor Castle and ordered a meeting between the two in person or else the aldermen would die. Later Brick transported the aldermen to his hideout, but not before Arsenal and Black Canary attempted to stop him. When Arsenal shot an arrow into Brick's arm, an enraged Brick shot one of the aldermen in front of them and dumped his body on the street. He later met with Mayor Castle, Quentin and Ray and ordered all police to leave the Glades or the other aldermen would die. Arsenal and Black Canary stormed Brick's hideout and freed the aldermen but when Black Canary confronted Brick again he still overpowered her, forcing her to run. Though he lost the aldermen, he later informed Mayor Castle that he had the addresses of every city official in the city, forcing her to order the evacuation of the Glades.

   With all the cops gone, Brick and his men quickly took control of the Glades. He made his men extort the people living in the Glades and took the abandoned police precinct as his headquarters. Learning that two of his men encountered Arsenal but got away, he gave them his gun and ordered them to kill him in order to survive. One guy went for the gun, but Brick grabbed it first and shot him. The power went out and Brick quickly rallied his men, ordering them to shoot anything that moves. Black Canary and Arsenal took out some of his men but Brick went for a shotgun and started to shoot flares at them. Knocking them down, he moved in with his gun to finish them off, but his hand was shot with an arrow by the

   He later left his headquarters as Black Canary and Arsenal approached him again. He rallied his goons and seemingly outnumbered them, but then their army, including Diggle,
   Sin
   and
   Wildcat
   , arrived. Brick ordered his men to fight
   Team Arrow
   's army and also engaged Wildcat, who managed to hurt Brick, despite Brick eventually coming out on top. Black Canary and Arsenal came to Wildcat's rescue, forcing Brick to run. When in an alley, however, he was confronted by the Dark Archer again who fought him, but Brick lost as the Dark Archer subdued him. He revealed his identity as Malcolm Merlyn, Rebecca's husband, who angrily pointed his gun at him and prepared to execute him. The Arrow appeared, trying to persuade Malcolm to spare him if he truly wanted to make things right, and Malcolm ultimately agreed. Brick was promptly arrested and incarcerated.

   When Brickwell realized that his plan to take over the Glades had failed, he tried to goad Malcolm into killing him so he would not do any jail time before being stopped by the Arrow.

   , Brickwell, along with Ben Turner and Derek Sampson, wanted to get some payback on Oliver for his previous defeat, but also coerced him to do a dirty work. Brickwell reluctantly helped Oliver regarding information about Ricardo Diaz and the person nicknamed "The Demon" who was in Level Two of prison. When Diaz made prison riot, he briefly allied with Diaz but he ultimately wanted to escape from the prison. Brickwell was convinced that he will escape but was surprised that another prisoner Stanley Dover killed him in the morgue, ending his life for good.

    Brickwell has an uncanny ability to survive being shot anywhere on his body, actually giving his opponents one free shot before doing battle with them. While being shot in the head with a bullet does little to injure him, he can be hurt, albeit very temporarily, with an arrow into his torso.

     Peak of human physical condition:
    </b>
    While once at peak physical conditioning in his younger days, Brickwell has since "gone to seed" as he reached middle age. Despite this, he is still a highly fit individual. From his constant gambit of giving his victims a chance to kill him first, he has repeatedly shown great speed and reflexes, with tremendous physical strength, regularly striking his target before they even get a chance to fight back, at one point beating
    Jose Anton
    to death with only a few blows and he could even fairly quickly outpace and best other physically powerful individuals, such as

    before being beaten. With help from
    Ben Turner
    and
    Derek Sampson
    , Brickwell could fight and beat Oliver who was holding back. Alongside Sampson, Brickwell was able to fight and hold his own against Oliver when he fought to kill, although he needed to cheat to overpower him. He was also able to hold his own against Turner in their first encounter but he was easily defeated and stabbed by the rope Turner had in their last brawl.

     Indomitable will/High tolerance for pain:
    </b>
    Brickwell's body was (seemingly) inhuman in terms of durability, able to withstand physical trauma as extreme as John shooting him in his head, as the bullet only grazed his skin and he was unfazed by the attack. He also laughed it off when
    Jose Anton
    shot him in the shoulder. Nevertheless, he is still vulnerable, as he is seen able to visibly bleed and be in pain from being shot by an arrow, though he quickly recovered. In an actual fight, he is able to take multiple blows from weapons and fists with only minimal damage. During his fight against Ted, a professional and master fighter, Danny took the initial beating before quickly rebounding. Danny still has limits as to how much punishment he can withstand as he was quickly toppled by Malcolm with just two strikes (albeit possibly contributing to the damage Ted already inflicted), Oliver was able to eventually knock him out with a few blows and Turner could quickly injure him with just a few blows and having his neck stabbed by and used as a rope climber was able to incapacitate him.
