   Barry, Joe and Tracy are devastated over Iris' death. But when H.R. drumsticks fall from Iris' corpse, she gasps, and takes away the disguise: Savitar stabbed H.R. Iris wears H.R.'s look, and reveals herself to be alive. It is revealed, that H.R. went after Savitar after he abducted Iris from Earth-2. He found his lair, and managed to free Iris. But they got caught by Killer Frost, and they changed places, without Frost or Savitar realizing the shift. H.R. asks Barry to tell Cisco about something, just before he dies, leaving Tracy devastated. However, Savitar fled with the Speed Force Bazooka. In the forest, Killer Frost is about to kill Cisco, when Savitar arrives, and tells her they need Cisco to build something for them. He then has new memories, and sees that Iris is still alive, with H.R. having taken her place.

   In the Time Vault, Barry, Iris and Joe look upon the future article, and it is once again written by Iris, meaning the future has been restored. However, the team agree they still need to stop Savitar, despite the fact, that paradox that erases him, will caught up to him within few hours, as Iris' death was the only thing that keeps him able to exist. In Savitar's lair, Savitar forces Cisco to adjust the Bazooka, so that he can split himself to exist in every possible moment in time. Cisco refuses, but Savitar tells him, if he doesn't, he will kill Caitlin. Not willing to let Caitlin die, Cisco begins working.

   Barry comes up with an idea to stop Savitar by doing something he won't expect. He goes to meet him and offers his help to make sure, he keeps on living. They arrive at S.T.A.R. Labs, and Savitar gets an uneasy reception. Although it seems he is willing to accept help, they need Tracy for it. But she refuses to help the man who murdered H.R. Iris has Harrison Wells to be brought to Earth-1 to convince her. He seems to be able to do it. Savitar memorizes many things, even some that haven't happened yet, but concludes, that when he exists alongside Barry, Iris will still be with him, which leaves him alone. Iris is seemingly able to convince him to bring Cisco and Caitlin back, but when he speeds out, it turns out he set the Philosopher's Stone to self-destruct in the breach lab. Barry and Wally speed everyone out, before the blast destroys the Labs.

   In Savitar's hideout, Cisco has finished his work on the Bazooka. He tries to convince Killer Frost, that after Savitar is done with her, he will kill her. Savitar returns and after learning Cisco is ready, he orders Frost to kill him. But with a timely arrival by Gypsy, Cisco is saved. However, he is not particularly happy about it, but Gypsy reveals she knew he was in trouble, because they share a connection. They landed on Barry's apartment, where others are already, and Cisco reveals, what Savitar is trying to do. The team bands together to stop him once and for all.

   At the park, where his monument was erected, Savitar and Killer Frost are preparing for his ascension. He opens a breach to the Speed Force, and reveals the reason, why he needed Killer Frost's help. Soon, Black Flash appears from the Speed Force, and Frost freezes him solid and shatters him, as only Frost's ability to freeze things to sub-zero, would be enough to destroy him. Savitar then has Frost use the Bazooka on him. However, the Bazooka doesn't work, and suddenly, Jay Garrick blasts his way out from the Speed Force. Team Flash arrives, and Cisco reveals he sabotaged the bazooka. Enraged, Savitar prepares to fight, taking on Barry, Wally and Jay, while Cisco and Gypsy take on Killer Frost. They are able to defeat her, and she attempts to goad Cisco into killing her. Cisco refuses, and gives her a choice: to use the cure Julian made for her and be rid of her powers. Savitar knocks Barry and Cisco down, and is about to finish Cisco off, when he is struck by a cryokinetic blast, revealing, that Caitlin has resurfaced. Savitar, knowing his end is imminent, is going to kill all of Barry's loved ones before he is erased. But as he is preparing to leave, Barry phases into his suit, and knocks Savitar out from it. He then uses the suit to beat him to the ground, and destroys it afterwards. Savitar urges Barry to kill him, but he won't, not letting his darkness determine, who he is. Victorious, Barry walks towards Caitlin and Cisco, when Savitar, in a rage, attempts to strike at Barry, but he is shot in the back by Iris. After that, he is erased forever.

   A private funeral is held for H.R., where Iris holds a eulogy. Caitlin is not among the others, but she is spotted nearby. Barry, Cisco and Julian attempt to get her to come back, but she refuses, and reveals she didn't take the cure. She claims she isn't Caitlin anymore, nor Killer Frost. She decides to leave to find out who she is, alone, and others don't make an effort to stop her.

   In their apartment, Barry and Iris are laughing, when they shouldn't. Iris reveals she had wedding invitations made some time ago, but didn't send them as she wasn't sure, if she would be alive. Barry speeds them to the recipients in two seconds. As they are about to find happiness, an earthquake like phenomena strikes the city. The team is at S.T.A.R. Labs in order to learn, what is going on. Jay finally realizes, it's the Speed Force Prison. Without a speedster inside it, the Speed Force has become unstable. Barry realizes, that he must go to the Speed Force in order to stabilize it. In front of the S.T.A.R. Labs, Speed Force lightning strikes everywhere. Iris says, he can't go, as he will face hell if he goes, like Wally and Jay did. A Speed Force breach opens, and Nora Allen-avatar comes out, reassuring that Barry won't be going to hell, but like every speedster, he has reached his finish line. Barry says hearty goodbyes to everyone and enters the Speed Force.
