   ", as well as a former "Heir to the Demon" and the archenemy of
   Sara Lance/White Canary
   . After escaping death at Ra's hands, Damien stole water from the
   Lazarus Pit
   and formed his own version of the League called
   H.I.V.E.
   . However, Damien's methods were far more extreme and killed thousands of people. Using the Lazarus Pit, Damien continued his schemes for over a century, plotting to end the world in nuclear fire to give it a fresh start. Damien spent years gathering the resources and followers to build a shelter to survive such an apocalypse. Around 2011, he obtained the
   Khushu Idol
   which gave him numerous powers and abilities and made him virtually unstoppable.

   In 2015, Damien brought H.I.V.E. to

   if he didn't comply and eventually did so when Quentin betrayed him. Just as Damien almost succeeded in his plan, his
   wife
   was murdered and his ark destroyed. He was opposed by the people of Star City who Oliver had rallied together to stand up to H.IV.E.. Shortly after this, he was killed by Oliver in revenge for killing Laurel.

   , and they began traveling through time to obtain the Spear of Destiny, a powerful artifact capable of altering reality, eventually managing to gather the fragments and rewrite reality to their whims, where Damien was the mayor of Star City and had killed many heroes. Eventually, the Legion was defeated by the Legends and Damien was returned to his own time with his memories erased by Sara, restoring the timeline and Damien's actions until his eventual death in 2016.

   A year after his death, Damien's corpse showed up in 1895

   in order to resurrect him; Damien returned to life with his erased memories of his time battling the Legends as part of the Legion of Doom restored, as well as his magical powers fully intact without the need for the idol he'd previously used to access his powers. He worked with Nora and the Order to free Mallus from his
   prison
   and eventually complete Genesis. During his missions, he used the aliases "

   ". However, after realizing that Mallus's freedom would mean the death of Nora, the demon's host, Damien briefly allied with the Legends to save his daughter's life. With the help of

   who asked for his assistance in cooperating with the
   Nazis
   in order to obtain an artifact in his possession. He had him work with the Germans to kidnap
   Albert Einstein
   and create an atomic bomb to destroy New York. Darhk had gone to New York and met with the Nazis to inform them that he had acquired the Uranium needed for the weapon, but they still needed the proper expertise to weaponize it. The Nazis told him that they were working on kidnapping a
   scientist
   they needed to accomplish this. Unknowingly, he was being hunted by Sara Lance who had wanted to kill him in order to stop him from killing her sister Laurel in 2016. However, she had been pulled back from trying to assassinate him in order to find where the Nazis were keeping their bomb and Einstein.

   The Germans managed to kidnap

He ordered for her to be brought on board a submarine but the Legends arrived to stop him from taking her and the bomb. Darhk was then confronted by Sara Lance and he was able to recognize her fighting technique from the League of Assassins. She told him that she was there to kill him, to his confusion, but he managed to hold her off. The Legends managed to get Maric but couldn't get rid of the bomb and were forced to pull out. Darhk then boarded the Nazi submarine with the bomb and headed for New York. They detected the

   Darhk was then met with the Nazi commander who was angry as Darhk promised there would be no trouble but Darhk calmly countered that he was promised competence from them. When the commander suggested to try again with another bomb, Darhk said there wouldn't be a next bomb as his partner was moving on to something else. The Nazis were ready to kill Darhk for his insolence, but Thawne arrived and killed the entire crew save for Darhk.

   In 1962, a man named

Future Darhk used his magic to catch Nora, and Damien tried to use the situation for his adventage. Darhk shot his future self, but future Darhk caught the bullets with his magic. The two started fighting, while future Darhk tried to catch Nora. During the fight, Darhk was impressed from his opponent's magic powers, and noted that he should study it in the future. Eventually, Nora finally got her powers from the

   In 1987, Damien was in the middle of a black market deal that the CIA had stumbled upon. Before he could handle the situation, Eobard Thawne arrived and killed everyone leaving only the two of them. Thawne told Darhk that he was looking for a partner but Damien told him that he preferred to work alone. Thawne told him that he knew what he was planning with his Ark and offered to give Damien actual power instead of symbols of power. Damien then went to the Nuclear Treaty being done in Washington D.C. and joined
   Ronald Reagan
   's administration as an advisor. He would go to be a key part of the disarming the nuclear arsenals of the US and USSR. This created an aberration which summoned the Legends. Darhk was in the White House when he was spotted by Ray and Mick who alerted the team. Sara then snuck off to try and kill Damien but she was spotted by the Secret Service and Darhk managed to get away.

  <p key="5081c4b0-f3f1-4425-a149-8a028bf3a664">
   Later that night, he met with an agent of the KGB, Boris, in order to negotiate a trade that would be held during the peace dinner at the White House. His meeting was stumbled upon by a young Martin Stein who was hoping to use Darhk's White House connections to pass his research proposals to the President but the young man realized what Darhk was doing in the park with the KGB agent. Damien then stabbed the young man to keep his position a secret. During the dinner, Damien took some of his HIVE ghosts with him and traded nuclear launch codes to the KGB while they gave him an artifact that they had in their possession. However, the Legends and
   Obsidian
   showed up to disrupt their meeting. Damien taunted them with the fact that he planted a bomb at the dinner to destroy all hopes of peace between the superpowers before he killed Boris and opened fire on the KGB to start a fight. He then shot Obsidian and was then confronted by Sara Lance who he remembered back from 1942. At first, he thought she was still young through the Lazarus Pit but she revealed that she was a time traveler. She then taunted Darhk about how his plans in the future were derailed and he was killed while he listened in both anger and shock. Before anything else could be done, he was whisked away by Eobard Thawne.

   However, he discovered that the medallion had been swiped away from him by Sara during her revelations to him about his future. Damien tried to assure Eobard that he would get the medallion back for him but the speedster told him that the Legends had already left 1987 and it was now beyond his reach. With knowledge that all his plans and hopes for the future end in failure and in his demise, he asked for Eobard to take him along so that he could change his destiny. Eobard agreed to the alliance and showed Damien his
   Time Sphere
   . He went inside as Thawne activated it with his speed and the two went off into the timestream.

   Both Damien and Eobard went to the year 2016, just after his death where they met up with Malcolm Merlyn. Damien wasn't too impressed with Malcolm as he was binge drinking and living in squalor though Eobard told him that the man used to be Ra's Al Ghul but had fallen on hard times. Merlyn was surprised to see Damien as he had just watched his final moments on television just seconds before their arrival which Damien told him that he was driven to change. The two of them then offered Merlyn his own chance to change his destiny along with their own and the man agreed.

   then went off to Chicago in 1927 where they met up with
   Al Capone
   . They warned him of the impending arrival of the FBI led by
   Eliot Ness
   and offered their help in seeing that his empire didn't fall. This was a plan to create an aberration to lure in the Legends so that they could get the medallion they took from Damien back in 1987. Damien laid in wait at the docks and saw that it worked when the Legends arrived to save Ness from being killed by Capone.

   Darhk was at Al Capone's night club where he bumped into the Legends as they were trying to find the ledger of Capone's dealings so that history could be placed back on track. Before they could do anything about him, Thawne arrived and incapacitated them and they managed to take both Martin Stein and Sara Lance hostage. After Malcolm Merlyn failed to cut a deal with them for the amulet, Darhk arrived to convince them a different way. He said that he would torture them for the amulet and Sara told him to do his worst. Darhk was amused that she thought he meant her and took Stein away. When the Legends arrived to save their friends, they barely managed to escape as Capone and his men tried to kill them. However, it was revealed that it was all theatre as Capone asked Damien if he was convincing enough. Damien told Capone that he sold it and that everything was going according to plan.

He told them that it was a compass that led to the Spear of Destiny and it had the power to rewrite reality itself. Thawne then revealed that their next step was to find someone that Damien had met before,
   Rip Hunter

   Damien Darhk and Malcolm Merlyn then went off to Los Angeles in 1967 to track down the Spear of Destiny. They walked through Hollywood before they went and killed two bikers that tried to rob them and stole their motorcycles. Their murders of these men caused a small aberration as one of them was supposed to go on and make a new engine for motorcycles which summoned the Legends. The two of them followed the trail from the medallion to a film set where they found Rip Hunter, going by the name Phil, where he was shooting a movie with
   George Lucas
   . They moved to try and take him captive but the Legends arrived and were surprised to see that Rip was there and fought against them to get him back. The fight saw that Rip was arrested and brought to the police station and also went on to cause an aberration which had George Lucas quit film school. Darhk and Merlyn tried to pick up Hunter at the station but the Legends managed to get him to the
   <i key="b1ed5873-8edf-4f28-8d36-dc8c85e242e3">
    Waverider
   </i>
   . The two of them saw that Rip didn't have the spear so they went on to question his film crew and learned that George Lucas had it. When they tracked him down, they found that
   Nate
   ,
   Amaya
   , and
   <a href="Ray Palmer.html" key="f00cebe8-b5e5-473d-8da6-17f27f38c76d" title="Ray Palmer">
    Ray
   </a>
   were with him and surprised them before taking them prisoner. Nate found he didn't have his powers anymore and Ray didn't have his suit due to the aberration and the two also took Amaya's totem. Darhk then angrily interrogated Lucas for where the spear was and he quickly confessed that he thought it was a useless movie prop and threw it in the trash. He then asked Lucas where the city dump was located.
  </p>
  <p key="7b21dabc-33a3-49bd-b2d5-20bcb5ab0790">
   Darhk and Merlyn brought the four to the dump and forced them to start digging through the trash for the spear. To motivate them, they turned on the trash compactor so that they would hurry and find it faster. The four found it but knew that Damien and Malcolm would kill them as soon as they got it. They inspired George Lucas to believe in the impossible again and he yelled that he wanted to direct which corrected the aberration and gave Nate his powers back and Ray his suit. They then managed to overpower Damien and Merlyn as well as take the medallion from them. Sara Lance and Jefferson Jackson also arrived and the two saw they were outnumbered. But Eobard Thawne showed up and tipped the scales back in their favor. Rip Hunter then showed up, dressed in his old coat and tried to pass himself off as his old self but the act was quickly seen through as they went and captured him. When 'Phil' asked if Eobard would torture him, he said he wouldn't before he pointed to Damien and Malcolm and said that they would.
  </p>
  <p key="a94c1b2a-5ad8-41fd-bc32-2e2d03724229">
   They tortured Rip but they didn't manage to get any new information about the spear. Damien and Malcolm were then berated by Eobard for losing the medallion to the Legends and forcing them into this dead end. When Malcolm tried and failed to use hypnosis on Rip, Damien again recommended torture sparking up an argument between him and Malcolm. Eobard audibly chastised himself for trying to rely on the two of them before he sped off. Damien then complained to Rip about how Eobard was treating him like a henchman which he didn't like at all. He then noticed something about Rip and proceeded to pull out his tooth which had a barcode embedded in it. Damien analyzed it and saw that it was information about a security deposit box for
   Lindgren Banking Securities
   in Switzerland. Eobard then told him and Malcolm to secure it before he sped off again. Damien thought the best way to get the spear from the bank was to just go in and kill everyone but Malcolm argued that they should use Rip to get through security and easily leave the bank with the spear. Damien then mocked Malcolm, calling him soft, to which Malcolm claimed that he didn't find Damien threatening at all.
  </p>
  <p key="d042044d-86c8-46e8-900d-535b6a8057a8">
   He relented to Malcolm's plan and took Rip to the bank where they had him go through security under their watchful eye. As they waited, Malcolm brought up the fact that Eobard was most likely hiding something given the fact that he never stays in one place. Damien then retorted that Malcolm shouldn't try making them start turning on each other as it could bring down everything but Malcolm heatedly shot back that Eobard didn't see them as equals but his lackeys. Rip got through most of the security but when asked to speak his vocal password, he froze as he didn't know it. Damien then moved in and killed the security official and he and Malcolm killed the other guards before they were forced to flee. Back at the hideout, Damien angrily told Malcolm that they failed because they followed his plan when they should've gone with his own. The two then engaged in a fight that ended in Damien coming out victorious with him putting his knife close to Malcolm while his other hand successfully prevented Malcolm from doing the same, but before Damien could kill Malcolm, they stopped when Rip shouted at them that this is what Eobard wanted and called them Eobard's henchmen, greatly annoying them both. Damien and Malcolm agreed and decided that they had to work together if they were going to get what they wanted without Eobard betraying them.
  </p>
  <p key="5301395f-6922-41cc-ac42-8b3c187d8acb">
   Together, they infiltrated the bank following Damien's original plan to kill their way through and got to the box but inside wasn't the spear. Eobard showed up, having learned where they were from Rip, and explained that it was a device that held memories, presumably Rip Hunter's. They then locked the vault trapping them inside and revealed that they were tired of Eobard ordering them around and wanted to be treated as equals as he needed them as much as they needed him. Eobard tried to threaten them but grew scared when his watch alerted him. He then revealed that there was a

   hunting him as he wasn't supposed to exist since his ancestor killed himself to try and erase him. The two agreed to help him escape if he agreed to treat them as equal partners and Eobard quickly agreed. They set a trap for the speedster which ended up working and trapping it in the vault.

  <p key="d17822f7-7642-41de-b373-d4588e3e1536">
   They returned to the hideout where Eobard began to decode the device for Rip Hunter's memories and said that they could easily restore them by plugging it into his brain. Damien asked why they weren't doing that now and Eobard revealed that they could also alter his personality, which they did to make Rip their newest ally.

  <p key="0a39e54e-f06f-4bcf-bc13-658f5c28c072">
   When Rip Hunter had his memory restored, he informed the Legion that the spear was in fragments entrusted to members of the
   Justice Society of America
   that he placed in three separate time periods. Damien went with Hunter to 507 A.D. where
   Stargirl
   was posing as Merlin in the legendary court of
   Camelot
   . Damien masqueraded as the Black Knight and abducted knights of the kingdom and had them turned into their puppets through advanced cyber mind control technology. Damien even crossed swords and brought down the legendary King
   Arthur
   himself. With Arthur under their control, they went into the castle where they ran into the Legends. Damien gave them an ultimatum: give them the spear by dawn or else they'll unleash their brainwashed army on Camelot and destroy it.

  <p key="cfeb98d5-f32f-4d15-bb3d-7c0657900f83">
   Rip Hunter was getting tired of waiting and wanted to attack the kingdom that night but Damien told him to have patience as it was easier to attack out in an open field than lay siege to a castle. Damien then warned Rip to show him more respect as the tech may control the army but didn't control him.
  </p>
  <p key="492711bc-2484-404d-9d22-c0f11ddf5dd0">
   When dawn broke, Damien looked out onto the battlefield to see that
   Guinevere
   had assembled the knights to try and resist them. He also saw that Stargirl and Ray Palmer were there too. When the battle started, it seemed like their army would overwhelm Camelot's but the rest of the Legends arrived to turn the tide and even found a way to disrupt their control of the army. When Rip was brought down by the now freed Arthur, he called out to Damien for his help but he just sneered at the former Time Master and said that he didn't do rescues. He then tried to flee but Ray went after him. When they were far enough, Damien stopped to meet him face to face and mocked him, saying that he was a glorified nerd and not a knight. Ray then attacked him with the fallen Sir
   Galahad's
   sword that he charged with the energy from his suit and managed to knock him down, although Damien was clearly caught off guard. However, Damien quickly brought out a hidden blaster and shot Ray before he went and made his escape.

   Damien was sent along with Merlyn to find the
   Kalabros Manuscript
   and he had returned to the
   Vanishing Point
   to find that the Legends had infiltrated their headquarters and stole the spear fragments from under Eobard's nose. He blamed Eobard for their current problem but the speedster pointed out that it might actually be a positive development as now they didn't have to go after the spear piece by piece. Darhk was skeptical that they would be able to get the spear now as they were and told Thawne that they had to change their game. They went back in time and acquired
   Leonard Snart
   before he joined the Legends and informed him of his doomed future. He agreed to help them get the spear and already had a plan which involved Mick Rory. Learning of the Legends' plan to get the blood of Christ and destroy the spear, they surprised them at the grave of Sir Gawain in 1916. They ambushed them with World War I German soldiers and forced the Legends to retreat.

  <p key="3b220a83-f733-4a26-98f4-670961516871">
   Darhk and Snart them waited at the site where the blood was on a battlefield. He thought it was impressive that the Legends managed to get a cease fire from the two armies and then demanded the spear be handed over or they would kill them. Rory then took the spear and joined back with his old friend but Sara Lance told them that she wouldn't let them get away. Darhk agreed and thought they could use a distraction so Snart re-sparked the fighting between the two warring sides with a grenade. Darhk, Snart and Rory were then picked up by Thawne who sped them off the battlefield.

  <p key="45b1021a-10e6-4f2a-9b5a-4de5391fb17e">
   Back at the Vanishing Point, Darhk admitted that he was impressed with Snart's plan to turn Rory against the Legends and get the spear for them. Merlyn then returned, having acquired the Calebros Manuscript which had the incantation needed to activate the spear. They then all grabbed hold of the spear as Merlyn read the chant and they all began to re-write reality to their whims.

   With the spear, the Legion created an
   altered reality
   . Damien had it so so as he was now the mayor of Star City and retained his magical abilities. He also had it so Sara Lance and Amaya Jiwe were now his personal hitmen and were loyal to him though Malcolm thought his decision as well as Thawne's to have Stein and Jackson as loyal employees was foolish. Darhk had his two assailants go out and bring in a vigilante that was causing him problems, who turned out to be this new reality's Felicity Smoak. He had her killed and then took her mask to add it to his collection of other masks from the various heroes and vigilantes that had stood against him and were now dead.

   However, he and Malcolm were worried about the fact that Thawne had custody of the spear and had destroyed the Calebros so that he was the only one that could activate his power. They were worried that Thawne would use it against them and brought in Snart for an alliance to safeguard against him. However, the plans had to change as the Legends were starting to remember their former lives and Rory was starting to get second thoughts. Darhk had Sara and Amaya go and deal with Rory, Nate and Ray but the two of them managed to get their own memories back and rejoined the Legends. When they all learned through Rory that the Legends were going to try and steal the spear back from Thawne before he could destroy it, they felt that it would give them the opportunity to steal it first.

   They went to S.T.A.R. Labs as the Legends got Jackson and were trying to get Stein back but were confronted by Thawne. They surprised Thawne and Darhk managed to grab the spear but it was taken from him by Sara. The spear was then given to Amaya by Rory and Darhk watched in horror as Amaya was about to use it to revert reality back to normal but Snart froze her and killed her with his Cold Gun before she could. However, his celebration was cut short when Thawne stole the spear back and then destroyed it with his new reactor. Thawne then warned him, Merlyn and Snart to not try to cross him again as they were no match for him.

   The Legends realized that to stop the Legion from rewriting reality, they had to risk going back in time to 1916, just before they had acquired the spear from their past selves. Damien had just been joined by Snart after he visited Mick Rory and learned of the Legends' plan for obtaining the blood of Christ when they were suddenly visited by Eobard and Malcolm. Damien was confused as he thought that Malcolm was hunting for the Calebros and Eobard revealed that he was from their future. He told them of the other set of Legends and told him, Malcolm and Snart to deal with them while the speedster went off to get backup.

When the Legends emerged, Damien headed over for them with the others and fired upon them. He and Malcolm tried to shoot down both Ray Palmer and Firestorm but they were too fast and they found their weapons had malfunctioned. Malcolm then suggested to him that they go "old school" which Damien agreed as he felt that killing had been to "impersonal" lately.

   Damien moved to engage the Legends with a sword but was held at gunpoint by future Rory who had his Heat Gun aimed at him. He was then told to let Damien go by Snart but Rory wouldn't listen to him and then Snart killed him with a shard of ice from his Cold Gun. Damien then moved off and surprised future Nate from behind and drove his blade into him. He then engaged Sara in a one on one fight. The two fought evenly for a while until she managed to get the upper hand on him and had his neck at sword point. He taunted her to finish him off but Sara just smiled and said that death would be too kind for him. He was then knocked out from a hit by future Sara.

   After Eobard was defeated and erased from the timeline, Damien, Snart, and Malcolm were taken prisoner. Malcolm was returned to the present but Snart pointed out that he and Damien were already dead by 2017, to which Sara told them that they weren't going to 2017. Sara took Damien back to 1987, where Eobard had plucked him from, to resume his timeline. Damien attempted to taunt Sara that she was setting him on the path to kill her sister. However, Sara replied she knew that but has accepted and is okay with it, and so was Laurel. A confused Damien asked how she knew that, but Sara didn't answer and simply wiped his memories of the future to keep the timeline in check.

In the meantime, Green Arrow and his team continued to plague Damien's operations in Star City culminating in a surgical strike against the HQ of the Ghosts by Green Arrow and his team in an effort to rescue Andy. Damien quickly became aware and sardonically confronted Speedy in a hallway, throwing her off with his magical powers before attempting to siphon the life out of her. To his horror, Damien's power had no negative effect whatsoever on Speedy and instead caused Damien to release her and double over in severe pain as dark patterns spread across his face before disappearing. Damien later stood in the crowd during Oliver's presentation where he didn't decline his previous proposal much to Damien's annoyance.

With the Khushu Idol fixed and his magical powers restored, Damien restrained Thea, Diggle, Oliver, and Laurel, revealing that he figured out their secret identities once Andy revealed his brother worked for Green Arrow. Damien mused how he should've figured out Oliver's identity sooner due to his determination to save William. As Damien approached Laurel, Oliver shot an arrow at him, but he stopped it with his telekinesis. Damien then stabbed Laurel in the stomach with the arrow to send a message to Quentin for turning against him. Damien, Malcolm, and Andy escaped with many of the prisoners.

Unfortunately for them, Blackbeard had hidden it with his treasure, so the Darhks decided to attack the pirate who was staying with Mick and Amaya first. With the help of General Maynard, they arrested the pirates, gaining time to find the pirate treasure. The amulet, however, was in the possession of the late Anne Queen, whom the criminals could not defeat until the arrival of the legends, who distracted the deceased, allowing Damien to attack her. As a result of the fight, Amaya became the target of Mallus, which forced Ray to fire an anti-magic weapon beam at Eleanor. This shocked the woman, which terrified Damien. The legends seized the opportunity to take the earth totem, fleeing and losing the
   Anansi totem
   in the process. After a short time, Palmer returned to the island, feeling guilty of hurting Nora, and gave her the serum in exchange for the stolen artifact. As soon as the woman recovered, she stunned the scientist Damien thought might be of use to them.

   The Darhk took Ray Palmer to the hideout, where they discussed the further plan with Kuasa. Ultimately, they decided to use a scientist to repair the destroyed fire totem. To that end, they traveled to the Upswipz headquarters, where they murdered the boss by providing the hostage with a laboratory, who quickly saw that the artifact could only be repaired with the help of a cold fusion, which in fact does not exist. Damien then confessed to killing Dr. Vogal during his teenage years, preventing him from publishing his findings. To achieve the goal, the Darhk had to stop the young Damian from doing this. Nora wanted her father to finally trust her and went to the scene with Palmer, escaping with Dr. Vogal from the attack. The time travel stone had been destroyed, however, so the three had to act on their own. The scientist was immune to torture, insisting that he would reveal the formula for cold fusion only when he returned to his family. Eventually, they managed to get overseas, but with Damien's help, which led to an argument between the Darhk. Thus, the younger version of Darhka kidnapped Nora and arranged a trade, during which there was a fight. At this point, Nora managed to activate Anansi's totem, defeating the young Damien. Unfortunately for the criminals, Kid Flash appeared out of nowhere and saved Palmer by taking pieces of the fire totem from the enemy. The Darheks did not care much about this and returned to their hideout happy to improve their relations. After Damien left, Mallus began to devour Nora, leaving black veins on her body.

   Damien and Eleanor were summoned by Kuasa to Detroit in 2018, who captured Heywood. In exchange for proving her loyalty, she wanted to regain Anansi's totem, which she gave her, leaving the hero to the Darhk. Damien decided to handle the torture while his daughter was away. However, he couldn't make the slightest attack because of the collapse caused by Nora's condition. He spoke honestly with Nat, expressing his concern. Eventually, they pretended to hate each other and beat each other to avoid suspicion. Eleanor soon appeared, pushing her father's telekinesis several meters away, simultaneously stunning him.

   Damien apparently used to be arrogant and overconfident, as he believed himself to be the worthy successor to the then-

   , he was immensely intelligent, cunning and calculating; as he managed to stay ahead of

  <p key="a20dea1a-8302-45a6-b445-758544ef849b">
   Damien was a perfectionist carefully planning out all his schemes and expects his subordinates to follow through without any mishaps. He will ruthlessly kill them for such failures if he believes they have not performed their duties to an adequate standard. Although he demanding good manners and respect from others, he was not above mocking people and their suffering.
  </p>
  <p key="139c2dbb-de42-4c3e-9b18-63a304d5824e">
   Damien believes that the world was resistant to change and sees himself as one who brings about progress. He views his attacks on

   as an act of mercy comparing it to putting down a dog on the street. He believes that to build something new and great the old must first be torn down first. Despite being marked for death by his old allies in the League of Assassins he has continued to follow the philosophy of the league and carries on with his own interpretation of it through his organization,
   H.I.V.E.
   . Despite his supposed good intentions, Damien has shown that he loves killing and torturing for his own amusement and it would give him great joy to watch the world burn regardless if he thought it was for the betterment of humanity.
  </p>
  <p key="3671e603-d91a-42b4-92d9-0e9b803c92c7">
   Like many assassins, Damien was cold, cruel and ruthless, but he does have a sense of honor and good morals; for example, Damien has morals against torturing innocent children and says it was a line he would never cross, he became disgusted with
   Lonnie Machin
   for kidnapping
   Jessica Danforth
   's daughter
   Madison
   , part of this might be related to Damien having a child of his own and understanding the pain of having a child in danger. Although he threatened William's life to get Oliver to give up his mayoral campaign and his attempts to fight Damien, displaying that he feels only if he was justified in carrying out such an action whereas he was angry at Lonnie for doing the same thing (albeit he still didn't cross the more line; regarding kidnapping or torturing innocent children) and Malcolm was the one who technically kidnap William, Damien chose not to release him from his captivity and would never have done so had Oliver not followed his instructions, and would not have harm William even if Oliver had refused to not followed his instruction; due to Damien being a parent himself. He also advised

   to put his daughter back to her final rest as he believed that was more merciful than her enduring the consequences of her resurrection from the
   Lazarus Pit
   . He advised Quentin to do this as "one father to another".

  <p key="10d8b1ba-8736-4cfa-9e1d-a69a5f757c28">
   Despite normally being serious and cruel, Damien was shown to have a definite (if sick) sense of humor, he grinned while mocking an
   A.R.G.U.S.
   guard whose life-force he was draining, declaring that it was fun and he could do it all day. Though confused when the Flash saved Green Arrow, as it happened so fast he had no idea what happened, he was also amused.
   His demeanor can be described as charmingly demented, as he is often quick to make light of whatever situation he is in, such as throwing in quips or comical references, regardless of the danger or gravity of what is occurring. This trait typically manifests through his smiling and jovial tone of voice at times that most people would consider inappropriate or unusual. It was a rather unnerving trait that intimidates his enemies and befuddles his allies on a regular basis. Upon his resurrection, he annoyingly asked "who stole my watch?", when he found that it was missing while all the witnesses were shocked or in awe to his revival.
  </p>
  <p key="7145dd48-a573-4d24-862b-c3ccc85b3ed4">
   Damien's ruthlessness was reserved for his enemies and keeping his men in place, and did not extend to his H.I.V.E. associates or family, he had protected his associates from Green Arrow, and weathered their sarcasm during setbacks without violent outbursts, such as when

   Despite these negative traits of Damien's, he was a loving husband and father; as he cares about his wife
   Ruvé Adams
   and his daughter
   Nora Darhk
   , as he will kill anyone who dares try to harm them, he also had no tolerance for those who disrespect members of his family, as he killed Tomas for disrespecting his wife. Ultimately, once learning of his wife's death and the possible demise of his daughter, Damien lost all care for a better world, seeking to destroy it, regardless of who dies.

  <p key="ad3d0458-6bb2-45b4-a785-5e992751186f">
   Ruvé's death and the destruction of Genesis had wracked all of Damien's hope for humanity, gaining a nihilistic and misanthropic perspective on everything. He truly believed that humanity was diseased and lacking in strength, unity and conviction, believing that Genesis was the only opportunity for the human race to restart through a peaceful utopian society (which ironically, most of its civilians are controlled through mind control) by starting anew. Damien still believes in what he was doing, claiming his goal to "cleanse (the world) of a millennia worth of rot" but now views the world as beyond saving, and its annihilation was a mercy. His grief over Ruvè had allowed himself to be engulfed over his insanity, as he was willing to kill himself and his daughter with the rest of the world but claims in the end the two would see Ruvé again.

   Though Damien despises being treated as an underling or henchman, he had also displayed a willingness to work with others instead of a leader position to gain what he wants, displaying that he can work without his pride getting in the way especially the greater the self-benefit for him. Even though he hated working under Eobard Thawne's control of Damien tolerated it for the sake of his own survival in the future though with prompt from Malcolm Merlyn he forces Thawne to treat him as an equal partner. Similarly, Damien has a sense of gratitude as he devoutly followed the time demon, Mallus after he resurrected him, even giving the demon his precious daughter and following out his orders with ruthless loyalty.

  <p key="33a43d75-4c06-4148-a7cb-d6e52ba3a12d">
   However, Damien proved that he did have a heart as he loved his daughter, Nora very much. When Ray had fatally shot her with a special gun designed to work against dark magic, he was immediately willing to trade Amaya's totem, which Damien had stolen, for a cure Ray had concocted, as Ray didn't want to be responsible for killing Nora. Although, when Nora immediately began to recover, he quickly double-crossed Ray, taking him prisoner. His love for his daughter was also shown when he, realizing that Mallus's freedom would be the death of his daughter, willingly aligned himself with the Legends to keep Mallus imprisoned by preventing any further anachronisms, releasing Grodd in 1992 Zambesi to destroy the village only in an effort to stabilize the timestream. He was even willing to sacrifice himself for her, taking her place as Mallus's vessel after realizing that his host would die and that he loved Nora and he did not want to see her become a "monster" like him. In an alternate future timeline, Damien worked with Barry to bring her back, expressing fondness and respect for Barry as they parted ways.
  </p>
  <p key="38d5a242-7c3d-46fa-acc7-ec3e27447d2a">
   After being resurrected by Mallus with the failure of Damien's lifelong ambition "the Ark", he had displayed an even more sadistic and chaotic nature by reaping destruction across the timeline with his cabal to free his master, Mallus only to watch the world burn and rebuild it for the future, however, Damien would show that he regretted his actions as he selfishly allowed his daughter to be corrupted so he could be revived, even sympathizing with his hated enemy, Sara as he now understood the true agony of losing someone you love admitting that if he could take back murdering Laurel he would. Despite being enemies with the Legends, Damien has admitted that he liked Raymond because of his care for Nora (however misguided) and could sympathize with Nate with his problems even while Damien was torturing him.

    and
    Sara Lance
    . However, once Damien became a sorcerer, he developed an over-reliance on his supernatural powers granted by the Khushu Idol, causing his prowess as a combatant to noticeably decline; this was perhaps best highlighted in his younger 1987 version, who proved to have much more combat-finesse than he will be in the early 21st century, as his younger-self has yet to acquire the idol and it's mystical benefits at the time, at which point he was able to quickly gain the upper hand against Sara in hand-to-hand combat and even dominate Sara using her signature weapon as well as eventually defeating Malcolm in their duel. It appears that while magic gave him full access to his original level of skills, losing it can briefly deprive him of his combat skills, as while he proved to be able to easily defeat Oliver after he received League of Assassins training while he was rusty from months of not fighting and remain on equal footing with Oliver after he got back in shape as well as overpower Malcolm, once deprived he was swiftly beaten. In spite of that, Damien appears to have retrained himself after getting out of prison as while his magic was unable to be used against Oliver, due to Oliver's light magic, he was still able to fight him on equal footing and even at times dominate and knock him down twice and disarm him of his bow, only barely losing. Damien was one of the deadliest combatants in the entire

If it the idol were to be destroyed, he will lose his magic completely. After his resurrection, he regained his powers without the need of the idol.
