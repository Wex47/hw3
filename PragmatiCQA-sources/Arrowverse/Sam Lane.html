   Sam was born in the 1950s into a
   military family
   . When he was a child,
   his father
   used to bring Sam and
   his sister
   to the movies every Sunday. During one of these occasions, they saw

    The Day the Earth Stood Still

   , which strongly impressed and terrified Sam. The film would be one of the catalysts which convinced Sam that extraterrestrials were the biggest threat to both the country and the whole planet, since their technology and powers could wipe out the human race in a few moments.

   Growing up, Sam followed the family tradition by joining the
   U.S. Army
   and climbing the hierarchy until he earned the rank of general. He fathered two daughters;

   Lois Lane
   and military lawyer
   Lucy Lane

   who also served as a legal attaché on his staff. Over the years, Sam's relationship with Lois became estranged, due to his immorality and control issues over her life.
  </p>
  <p key="c4bf2678-2a29-4b91-a6ca-490d9002bb8b">
   Due to Sam's strong anti-alien ideas, he viewed even
   Superman
   as a potential threat to America. Due to this, Sam had tried to establish a partnership with the
   D.E.O.

   General Sam Lane came to
   National City
   , as he wanted "
   Hank Henshaw
   " to transfer
   Supergirl
   to his unit. However, Hank could not, as she did not technically work for the
   D.E.O.
   Then, he demanded that Supergirl fight their field robot
   Red Tornado
   . Supergirl won the battle, breaking off the android's arm with her freezing breath, and causing damage in his system. As Red Tornado flew,
   Dr. Morrow
   said his robot activated the self emergency protocol, so General Lane fired Morrow because he did not cope with the task. The next day, the general had dinner with
   Lucy
   and
   James
   , to whom he told (in an arrogant/disrespectful manner) that James is not worthy of his daughter - that James surrounded himself with special people because he's not good enough himself. Later, General Lane, Lucy and James were attacked by Red Tornado, and Supergirl rescued them but is forced to allow the android to escape in order to diffuse a tornado it caused. Later, "Henshaw" suggested using alien technology that created the hologram of General Lane to draw out Red Tornado, and Supergirl destroyed it.

   When "Hank Henshaw" was captured by
   Astra and Non's army
   , General Lane returned to National City to temporarily perform his duties as director of the D.E.O.; he tortured
   Astra
   by injecting her with liquid Kryptonite to learn the location of their base, but she gave them a false position, which turned out to be a trap. Then Supergirl decided to make an exchange of prisoners; despite the fact that the general was against it, he was forced to retreat as Kara stood her ground. After his return, "Henshaw" coldly told General Lane that his presence at the D.E.O. was no longer required, and General Lane and his team left.

   Later, Lucy asked his father to release

   Non
   and
   Indigo

   President
   granted him a full pardon and re-instated him as the director of the D.E.O. He then took Non's apocalypse device, the
   Omegahedron
   , under military custody and later delivered it to

   At some point, Sam became a general and had a daughter named

   Sam Lane and the
   army
   went to a nuclear plant that was about to explode. When he arrived at the site, he asked a worker how long they had before the plant exploded, with her replying that it would only take a few minutes and that radiation would cover the entire
   Metropolis
   . Then, using his device, he called the
   Superman
   to resolve the situation, and it worked. When Superman landed, they realized that the same thing had already happened to another plant, with Sam saying that the cracks were intentional and that worried him.

   He then asked if
   Lois
   was not complaining as Clark spent a lot of time away from
   home
   and said that he also wanted to take
   Jonathan
   fishing, and that maybe Clark could convince
   Jordan
   to come along. Clark said he was going to make an appointment with Lois and said goodbye to the General. When
   Martha Kent
   died, Sam attended her funeral. Sam later goes on to
   Kent farm

   Kryptonian language

   After learning that Lois, Clark and the children moved to
   Smallville
   , Sam comes to Kent farm just as Lois takes the twins with her to the town meeting. Sam berates Clark for revealing his secret identity to the children because he feels that it will take a toll on their mental health. The Stranger who had sabotaged the nuclear power plants appeared in the military facility that Sam was in and started attacking the soldiers, so Sam called Superman to stop him. Sam ordered everyone to leave the facility and the Stranger invaded, asking Sam to stop protecting Superman. Then he gives Sam an object with the symbol of the
   House of El
   and says that
   where he comes
   from,
   Sam
   doesn't trust
   Kal-El
   and knows what he's capable of. He asks for your help to stop him before Clark arrives and defeats him, which ends up being revealed as just armor. Sam then tells Clark what happened and shows the object. He says the Stranger was there after
   Kryptonite
   , making Clark angry. Sam says he had kryptonite so that no one could use it against Superman. In his office, Sam looks at the object and realizes that the word hell is in it.

   Days later, Sam goes to the twins' football game and realizes that Jordan has powers. Annoyed, he has an argument with Lois and Clark. He tells Clark that
   Killgrave
   has escaped from prison and then tells the children not to catch his father while he is Superman. After arresting Killgrave, the children tell Lois and Clark what happened, making them angry and going to get some satisfaction from Sam. Later, Sam called
   Rosetti
   to find out about

     Sam is extremely arrogant, self-righteous, short-sighted and disrespectful, although he genuinely cares about the welfare of his country, he is also quite selfish, as never takes responsibility or even admits to his own mistakes, always trying to shift the blame on others, he is incapable of expressing gratitude, even towards individuals who had saved his life, viewing their actions as only acting for their own selfish reasons, his elitist views even proves their nature when it comes to his parenting, regularly outright noting his disapproval of would-be suitors to his daughters that do not meet his overly-high standards. It can be assumed that he does not have a good relationship with his daughter, Lois; due to the fact that he interferes in her relationships with men.

     Sam has a strong view on aliens, deeply hating them simply because they are different, regardless whether or not they are a threat to the human race. He even dislikes anyone who associates themselves with aliens, like

      Superman

     Sam was an absentee father who put his duties over his own family, which lead to his relationship being strained with Lois since her childhood. He was also somewhat controlling when he saw Jordan display above average physical abilities emphasized the Kent family needs to keep their head down to avoid drawing suspicions to Clark; while true, Sam was still overstepping his boundaries. He also tried to tell the boys not to be too burdensome on Clark since he is Superman, which led to more fallout between him and his family.
    </p>
    After meeting with
     John Henry Irons
     , Sam began to think what would happen if Superman turned against the earth and he developed a project called 7734 (a name he got from Irons that when put upside down spells "hell") as a contingency in case such an event occurred. He did express regret that 7734 weapons ended up being used against Superman and acknowledged that he had lost his son-in-law's trust, and would have to work to regain it. After seeing Superman fight for humanity over his own kind and seeing how the kryponite affected Jordan, Sam decided to dismantle 7734; he would dispose of most of the kryponite but keep enough to keep Tal-Rho and Leslie Larr under lock and keep so there won't be enough to supply an army who would kill Clark.
