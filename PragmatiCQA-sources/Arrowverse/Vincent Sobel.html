   Vigilante emerged again, to try to kill
   Emily Pollard
   for also supposedly being corrupt after her crafting and supporting anti-vigilante legislation. He first attempted to kill her with a sniper rifle, but Dinah saw him and pushed her out of the way. He was caught on video camera, allowing Team Arrow to know he was back. When he attempted to sneak into Pollard's apartment, he was spotted by Dinah again, in which he tried to escape, realizing he couldn't escape in time, he attempted to raise a weapon at her but she used her Canary Cry to destroy his googles. He took off his mask revealing his identity to her, throwing her off, this allowed him to escape. Vincent later trapped Pollard again and attempted to kill her but Dinah once again showed up dressed as Black Canary, only for a police officer to aim his gun at the pair, when he shot the gun, Vigilante took the shot, Dinah sent the cop away to get an ambulance, but was shocked to discover that Vigilante had a healing ability. Vincent explained to Dinah, that what they did as cops did no good, she allowed him to escape and didn't inform her team. Later on, Vincent left a gift for Dinah in her car - the same kind he used to when they were together, revealing there may still be a part of the man whom she loved left in him.

   Vincent continued to send messages to Dinah all the time, eventually Dinah agreed to meet him and he wanted to be with her. She refused him and told him to leave Star City or next time she will take him down. Unknown to her, the conversation was watched by Oliver Queen, Felicity Smoak, and John Diggle, which caused a confrontation which ultimately led to Dinah leaving Team Arrow. Dinah contacted Vincent and she told him that she needed a friend, unknown to her, he has been working with
   Cayden James
   as he and the
   Cabal
   have been watching Dinah and Team Arrow for months.

   Over the following weeks, Vincent changed his image as Vigilante and stopped killing, forcing criminals to turn himself over to the police. Besides, he got much closer to Dinah, with whom he arranged to go for a walk by the river, where they hardly kissed. The romantic moments were interrupted by the phone call to Vincent who had to leave him. He was forced to show up in the team's hideout, thus presenting Cayden's numerous alliance before Green Arrow, who decided to escape. Soon after, he got a call from Dinah, who asked him to meet him, where a desperate slap on him and revealed that she knew about his cooperation with criminals. She couldn't understand that she had let him approach her and handcuffed him. This one, however, was cleverer and broke free, stunning the woman. A few hours later came the moment of the transaction with Bertinelli, with which the criminals met in his port. There was also an archer who was working with Jerry. However, the criminals turned out to be smarter, again provoking the hero to flee and killing Bertinelli. Soon after, Vincent was cleaning the weapons in the hideout when Cayden wanted to make sure Drake was not going to be a problem for him.

   When Cayden began implementing his plan against Star City, and Queen revealed that it was the hacker behind all the incidents, criminals took action. Before Sobel went with Sheck to a designated safe area for their attack, the ex-policeman sent the Outsiders information about the attack plan. As planned, the criminals met the avenger's resistance on the spot. During the fight, Sheck managed to get close to the Wild Dog and was close to firing a lethal shot, but then the Vigilante appeared as a double agent and shot Sheck before he could inform anyone that Vigilante was a traitor. After all this, Vincent met with Dinah, who forgave him for his lies and kissed him passionately.

   Sobel's romance with Dinah flourished again, however Cayden began to suspect the man of Sheck's murder and became wary of him. Vincent tried to keep the appearance of a "good criminal", but in the meantime he was seeing the Outsiders. The original team attacked him the next time he was passed on, but quickly realized her mistake. Everyone immediately went to the hideout, where all inconveniences were cleared up. Queen, however, still did not trust Sobel, but needed him to hack Cayden's servers. Everything went as planned, but when Vincent left the building, Anatoly Knyazev stunned him. As soon as he woke up, he was tied to a chair and awaited torture from his former allies. Fortunately for him, the Outsiders found Sobel, but it was a trap. On orders from James, the Black Siren began screaming in Vincent's ear, seeking the limit of endurance of his regenerative abilities, eventually killing him in front of her beloved.

    Vincent appeared to be a brave man who served justice as a police detective while also striving to protect his partner and mistress, Dinah Drake. Even when he knew he was going to die, he didn't care about his death, but tried to cheer up the woman who had been tortured for the past two weeks. Upon discovering the power, Vincent realized that as a policeman he did little and was looking for a new way of creating the Vigilante's alter ego.

     After becoming a vigilante, Vincent became extremely violent, cruel and ruthless, even towards criminals who had only committed minor offenses, he is also willing to kill criminals in cold blood, even if they have not physically harmed anyone.

     Vincent claims that he was exactly like

    <p key="7f1d4cb8-a2f4-41da-bfce-ad8c1fe50d9c">
     Vincent could be described as a fanatic where his crusade against crime is concerned, when Oliver (in the guise of his civilian identity) was threatening to face impeachment from his career as the mayor of

     , he tried to kill the latter, simply because he covered up the death of police detective,
     Billy Malone
     , claiming it was government corruption, he was similarly willing to sacrifice innocent lives as "collateral damage" if he deems it necessary, likening his actions to a war and thus; being willing to take such extreme measures. He thusly views Green Arrow with contempt for his unwillingness to take similar actions, feeling that the only reason Green Arrow did not do so was because he had not suffered sufficiently.

     As lost in bitterness and a vengeful attitude towards criminals as he's become, Vincent did genuinely believe he was doing the right thing; he saved an innocent from men who intended to traffic her and then told her to run, he also still cares for his former partner and ex-girlfriend,

      Dinah Drake

     , choosing not to kill her when she first opposed him and later taking a bullet for her, the subsequent interaction between them revealed that the reason he had not sought her out in the years since is because he did not wish to be "distracted". Between it all, it is apparent that, as

     Vincent prioritize his secret above his targets because he retreated when Mr. Terrific's equipment hit and destroyed his goggles.
    </p>
    Since reconnecting with Dinah, Vincent had become far less violent, cruel and ruthless towards criminals, to the point that he only scares these said criminals into turning themselves over to the police. Vincent did not care what other individuals in general think about him (with the exception of his girlfriend, Dinah) particularly Oliver.
