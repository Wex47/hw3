   The Captain of a boat strolls onto the harbor after weeks adrift. Three weeks prior he found a stowaway, who had 32 blades on him. The stowaway represents the first run through. He's hung tight quite a while for this chase. Unexpectedly, as though by enchantment, the stowaway gets his cuffs off and onto the Captain. The stowaway executes everybody on the dock, recovers his blades, and leaves.
  </p>
  <p key="0953b1cb-98ef-4d12-9fd6-3bc7dbd8d5c7">
   At the Police Station Barry, Joe, and Patty take a gander at photos of the crime scene on the dock. Barry clarifies that there was just a single executioner. There were bits of the blade in the people in question. Patty thinks it was a meta-human. She and Barry attempt to act professionally, which makes Joe chuckle and call them "adorable" for not being loving before him.
  </p>
  <p key="a28baf2f-1e0d-4bd0-9dc5-97766ba4ce09">
   At night, Kendra brings Cisco to Jitters for a date. She made them supper, and he is thankful. They flirt and are going to kiss when the stowaway shows up and says he is there for Kendra, who he calls Priestess Chay-ara. Cisco covertly messages Barry for help while standing protectively before her. He confronts the stowaway, who is going to toss a blade at Cisco when The Flash handles him. The stowaway tosses the blade at Cisco, and disappears while The Flash runs, getting the blade inches from Cisco's chest. Relieved, Cisco calls Barry by name before Kendra.
  </p>
  <p key="c0b40ec9-96a2-48c9-b684-05e7a5aad11e">
   In S.T.A.R. Labs, the group attempts to get information from Kendra, yet she knows nothing about the man. Barry figures they should go to their companions in Star City. Cisco is uncertain of this idea, yet Barry calls attention to that they are scientists who have little involvement in magic, while Team Arrow has plenty.

   In Star City, Damien Darhk and his ghosts are taking a bomb from an Argus truck. An arrow hits the ground close to them, revealing Green Arrow, Speedy, and Diggle to Darhk, who mocks them for carrying arrows to a gun fight. Green Arrow reacts by setting off a magnet in the arrow, which pulls all the firearms from the ghosts.
  </p>
  <p key="0567a8e8-d4ac-44eb-b545-bd1f3b693d4d">
   While the battle starts, Felicity is in the Bunker, complimenting herself on the achievement of the magnetic arrow, which was evidently her idea. Green Arrow reminds her she is on an open com line.

   At the Bunker, Barry is then again embraced and hit by Felicity, who is glad to see him yet furious he didn't tell her about Zoom's attack. Cisco is incredulous of their setup and says they need copper wiring to fix the forced blackouts which, despite everything, plague them. In the long run, Kendra is acquainted with the posse and Barry quickly outlines the stowaway's face, which Felicity offers to go through facial recognition. She finds an image of him from 1975, looking similarly as youthful as he does now. Ollie starts to address Kendra, and both Cisco and Barry get down on him about his brutality.

   Kendra sees someone in the window, in spite of how high up they are. The stowaway crashes through the window. Barry speeds Oliver his bow and arrows. The stowaway tosses a few blades, focusing on every individual in the room. Barry is fast enough to catch each blade, with the exception of the one which hits him. Oliver takes shots over and over at the stowaway, who blocks the arrows. Thea joins in with her own bow. At that point she and Oliver each get a hit. Oliver calls for Thea to stop, however she shoots a third time, thumping the stowaway off the gallery, lost in her bloodlust. Oliver and Barry investigate the edge, yet the stowaway is no place to be seen.

Jay tells Harry that he doesn't comprehend the Speed Force, it is a living thing. Jay cautions them against utilizing Velocity 6 on Barry. Harry takes off to get the supplies they need to make the serum.
