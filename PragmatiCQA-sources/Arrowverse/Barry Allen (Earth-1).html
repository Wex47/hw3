After the sudden return and help of the resurrected Earth-1 Harrison Wells, Team Flash found an alternate usage for the Speed Force machine. Channeling the residual Speed Force energy Iris from her various interactions with speedsters through hers and Barry's love for others into the machine, they were able to restore the Speed Force and Barry's powers.

   Soon after, Barry and his team are forced to contend with the brewing Godspeed War, masterminded by an artificial speedster August Heart, who seeks to become the God of Speed by stealing Barry's recently enhanced speed.

After later defeating Xotar, Barry, for unknown reasons, attacks Central City, an event caught on the news, although he does not remember doing it. After mentioning celebrating with Joe and Cecile, Barry is stunned to learn that Joe was dead, and had been for six months. After escaping another attack from Despero, Barry, feeling overwhelmed by recent events, calls for Black Lightning’s help at the
   Hall of Justice
   .
   After discovering that Eobard Thawne was behind it all along, he was able to defeat Despero and remove Thawne's speed, finally ending Armageddon.

   When he was six years old, Barry begged his parents to take him to a science exhibition in
   Midway City
   , but they, unfortunately, got a flat tire on the way. The family's car had to be towed to a garage in
   Masonville
   , where they were stuck all day. Barry and his parents had ice cream and french fries with gravy for dinner at a small diner and spent the night watching the local fireworks display. Barry would consider this to be one of the happiest memories he ever had with his parents.

   On March 18, 2000
   , 4 days after his 11th birthday, Barry ran home from school after getting into a fight with some bullies. Though not being fast enough, his mother assured Barry that he had a good heart, and his father was proud of him for winning the fight.
   Later that night, Barry was comforted by his mother when he admitted he was afraid of the dark. Nora convinced him he wasn't afraid of darkness itself, just being alone in the dark and wished him sweet dreams.

   That night, Barry was awoken by a commotion. He went downstairs and saw his mother surrounded in streaks of red and yellow lightning. Barry attempted to reach his mother but she told him to stay back and amidst the streaks, Barry saw "the Man in Yellow" for a brief moment, and his father urged him to run. At that very moment however, Barry suddenly found himself 20 blocks away (because his future self took him away from the

   Barry returned home in time to see his father being arrested by police, and was told by his father not to enter the house. He entered, seeing Joe standing solemnly over a body. When he walked away, Barry approached the body and discovered, to his horror, that it was his mother.

  <p key="92e561c9-d09e-4f85-9844-b70cbd6a32d8">
   Following the ordeal, Barry was fostered by Joe and Iris.

   Joe asked Iris to show Barry the guest room, and Barry told Iris that his father did not kill his mother, to which Iris responded that she believed him.
   Later that night, Iris found Barry crying alone and comforted him.

  <p key="d8bc3867-0ff1-4d3d-a095-c053dc15e47c">
   Living together caused an inhibitor between Barry and Iris, as growing up in the same household prevented their feelings (at least on Iris' side) from maturing beyond sibling love.

  <p key="fd40c583-dcfc-4d4d-973d-8d7864f77c51">
   Initially, Henry asked Joe to not let Barry see him. Not knowing this, Barry kept trying to run away to see his father at

   , and he was caught and stopped by Joe every time; at one point, Barry called him out for it, telling him that he wasn't his father and that he hated him. Eventually, Barry finally reached Iron Heights before Joe could stop him, and he finally came face to face with his father. Henry told him that he simply did not want Barry to see him in prison. Despite this, Barry begged for his father's release, insisting that the man in the lightning was who killed his mother, not Henry. Henry told him that he couldn't help him and asked that he be a good boy and let Joe raise him. Henry was promptly taken away and Barry became more accepting of Joe as his new guardian.

   Six months after his mother's murder, Barry was still depressed and became grumpy towards everyone. Seeing this, Joe understood that Barry was acting angry because he didn't want to let the pain of the grief in, fearing his father and mother would be disappointed in him if he did. Joe assured Barry it was okay to let the pain in. Barry finally allowed himself to feel the grief and cried, with Joe comforting Barry and promising that he'd always be there for him.

   During the first year that Joe took him in, Barry attempted to impress the former by building a robot with wheels for his science fair project, which nearly set the school gym on fire and hurt his teacher,
   Mrs. Dumas
   .
   In school, Barry was relentlessly bullied by
   Tony Woodward
   . Joe noticed this and had Barry spar with Iris, who easily beat him. Joe then told Barry that if he ever got into a fight he couldn't win, it was okay to run the other way.

   At the age of 12, Barry went to a reptile camp, which was paid for by Joe.
   In 7th grade, Barry decided to mix glycerol with an oxidizing agent for his science fair project, believing he would win if he started a chemical fire. Barry got an A, but was suspended.
   As a teenager, Barry, according to himself, "lived for danger", including smoking a cigarette once, which was an unpleasant experience.

   In high school, Barry attempted tryouts for the football team but failed horribly and made Joe swear to never talk about it again.
   Barry dated
   Becky Cooper
   in high school, though she was apparently a "nightmare" of a girlfriend.
   When Barry was 16, he and Iris switched bedrooms so Iris could sneak out the window past curfew, which was 8:00 pm at the time. They told Joe the reason they switched bedrooms was that Barry didn't like the noise from the streets.
   At one point, Barry and Iris took Joe's convertible out for a joyride and ended up crashing it into an oak tree on Fairmont Drive.
   Without realizing he was the man who killed his mother, Barry idolized Dr. "Harrison Wells" so much that read his
   biography
   twice, though he was still left not knowing much about him.

   Barry graduated from college with a double major in physics and chemistry.
   It was with this skill that Barry was motivated to study criminology at
   Central City University
   in the hopes of proving that his father was innocent in his mother's murder.
   Barry was hired for the
   Central City Police Department
   by Captain
   David Singh
   .
   Shortly after, around 2012, he was the Junior CSI on a murder case in which the victim,
   Judy Gimlin
   , was stabbed to death and her husband,
   Reagan
   , was the prime suspect, which touched home for Barry. His superior, Detective

   , apparently proved Reagan's guilt by finding the knife used to kill Judy, which contained his fingerprints. Seeing similar circumstances to his mother's murder, Barry decided to delve further into the investigation and tested the knife. The knife actually didn't match the murder weapon used to kill Judy and Barry reported Ralph, who was subsequently fired for planting evidence. This created an enmity between the two.

   Barry was set up in the division with Felicity's help, unknown to Barry, because Felicity believed that they should have used him as an asset considering his work in forensic science. The two began talking, and Barry began speculating about The Arrow and his background, making incisive observations about why The Arrow wore green instead of black, the type of arrows he used, and how he theorized that The Arrow has partners, particularly someone who had a background in computer sciences; all of this unnerved Felicity.
  </p>
  <p key="57a505c6-199c-4262-aedc-383624135db1">
   Barry was astounded when Felicity asked him to help with a blood sample from an arrow she received from the police both by her "connections" from working for Oliver, and the fact that he was working the same case as The Arrow. During that particular part of their investigation, Felicity invited Barry to a Queen Consolidated function, which was actually a party at the
   Queen Mansion
   . However, before the results came in, his cover as a crime scene investigator working for the police was blown by Oliver just after he and Felicity began arguing over a news report about the mass particle accelerator.

   It was revealed that he was just an assistant CSI and there was no connecting case in Central City. Barry explained what happened to him as a child and how it had caused him to begin looking into cases with impossible circumstances, in hopes of one day proving one possible, therefore solving his mother's murder and freeing his father. He was later re-invited by Oliver as Felicity's plus one to come to his home, where he was throwing a party for
   <a href="Moira Queen.html" key="7381936a-1277-43fb-902e-f491227632a9" title="Moira Queen">

   After the party, Barry was contacted by Singh and was told to return to Central City if he hoped to keep his job and revealed the sedative used was ketamine, informing Felicity it should have been easy to track. He tried to catch the soonest train, though missed the last one of the night. He settled down into the train station to wait for the next one in the morning, when suddenly he was hit with a tranquilizer dart to the neck. When he awoke, he found himself in

    Oliver's base

   with Diggle watching him and Oliver lying on a table in full Arrow costume. Felicity approached him and asked Barry to save Oliver's life, who was not only poisoned with an unknown substance from the A.R.G.U.S. disaster bunker, but also had been beaten by
   the robber
   who had stolen the centrifuge from Queen Consolidated, raided the blood bank, and encountered Oliver as The Arrow while stealing large amounts of ketamine from the bunker.

   Barry was able to save Oliver's life by thinning his coagulating blood with rat poison. Oliver was not too pleased with the situation at first, as Felicity had revealed his secret without his permission. However, Barry eventually gained Oliver's trust. He recommended that a mask would be better than the green grease paint he used on his eyes as concealment of his identity. Oliver later asked Barry if there were any side effects to the rat poison he injected in him, and Barry admitted it could cause hallucinations and heavy sweating. After testing Oliver's blood though, Barry discovered that Oliver's hallucinations weren't from the rat poison, and that it was psychological. Soon after, Barry headed back to Central City, but not before leaving Oliver a mask as a parting gift.

   and the two discussed physics and Harrison Wells' particle accelerator and how it would change the world.
   After he got off the train, Barry soon headed back to work, arriving at a crime scene late. He was successfully able to identify the getaway car from the robbery and also grabbed a sample of some animal feces found on the ground, before heading back to his lab to examine the evidence. While processing the feces, he was greeted by Iris. Barry talked on and on about the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator with her, noting that it provided ideas that were far beyond their current capabilities of science, hence why he was so excited. Detective West approached right as the feces had processed. Barry described the results found, explaining that it had a chemical used only at four different farms around town, suggesting they check them out.

  <p key="c418569a-812f-4fc5-9bf5-735cce371947">
   Following this, Barry and Iris headed to the unveiling and switching on of the particle accelerator. Barry attempted to convey his attraction towards Iris, but she simply misunderstood it. They began listening to Dr. Wells, who described how the particle accelerator would lead to a much greater future. As they were listening, a thief stole Iris' bag, along with her laptop inside it. Barry ran after him, attempting to catch up to him; however, the thief knocked the wind out of him and ran off, only to later get caught by detective
   Eddie Thawne
   . At the police station, Iris and Barry mocked Eddie, a new transfer from
   Keystone City

   Later, Barry headed to his lab, watching the news of the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator, when it suddenly became unstable. As Barry tried to close his lab's rafters due to the worsening storm, he watched in confusion and awe as the liquids around him suddenly levitated, defying gravity. The particle accelerator then exploded and sent a shockwave of
   dark matter
   through the city. Seconds later, Barry was struck by a yellow bolt of lightning through a window in the roof. He was sent flying backwards through the already-charged chemicals and knocked unconscious. A red flash of light appeared across Barry's cheek, rising, and then faded away.
   Barry was quickly rushed to
   Central City Hospital
   , where he was kept on life support while in a coma.

   For the following five weeks, Felicity visited Barry in the hospital while he was in a coma, and left only to help Oliver.
   Barry constantly seemed to flatline. However, it was concluded by Harrison Wells - who had also started visiting him - that Barry's heart was in fact beating too fast to even register on the EKG.
   When Barry's condition began to worsen he was moved to S.T.A.R. Labs to be closely monitored and was frequently visited by

   Freaked out by the incident, Barry promised to call Iris that night and left. Once outside, Barry noticed his hand vibrating at an unbelievable speed, shortly followed by him accidentally almost running into a bin at super speed, then breaking the back window of a cop car. Realizing the gifts he had, Barry went off running, testing out his super speed. Before long, he accidentally ran through the back of a van. Sometime later at
   an airfield
   , Barry met with Cisco, Caitlin, and Wells. He put on a tight suit and got ready to run. Dr. Wells cautioned restraint, whereupon Barry began to run at full pelt.
  </p>
  <p key="5bf636d7-10e4-4184-a201-c47cd4e45aa7">
   Partway through his test run, he began to remember the night of his mother's murder, specifically a ball of lightning with a man seemingly inside it surrounding his mother, and he crashed, fracturing his wrist. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, they discovered that Barry's wrist had healed in under three hours, much to their amazement. Dr. Wells inquired as to what happened, and Barry explained what he'd remembered: a man somehow inside a ball of lightning. Barry raised the question that perhaps there were more people like him, but Harrison rejected the idea, claiming that Barry was unequivocally one of a kind. Following that, Barry went to meet Iris at Jitters. He looked upon Iris and Eddie kissing. Barry and Iris soon took a walk as Iris explained to Barry how her and Eddie had met, asking Barry to promise not to tell her father. As they talked, a police car involved in a car chase slammed on the brakes, leading to Barry pulling Iris out of the way as the car hit the wall under the bridge. As the other car raced by, Barry recognized its driver; a man thought to be dead:
   Clyde Mardon
   . Barry ran after the car, crashing through the side and entering. Before Mardon could get his gun out, Barry grabbed the steering wheel, making the car tumble on its side and onto its roof. Mardon exited the vehicle, relatively unscathed and Barry quickly followed.
  </p>
  <p key="d064b235-f758-456e-a6a9-9462797d70f4">
   He called out to catch Mardon's attention, but soon the area was flooded with fog, apparently made by Mardon himself, causing a car to run into the already overturned car, forcing Barry to speed to a nearby patch of grass for safety. Paramedics soon arrived, along with the police, including Joe. Joe scolded Barry for having Iris out in the open and Iris for having followed the danger. Barry took Joe aside, telling him of his belief that the car was driven by Clyde Mardon, who had apparently survived a plane explosion, also somehow gaining the ability to control the weather. Despite various pieces of apparent evidence, Joe didn't believe him. Frustrated with Barry's apparent fantasies, Joe explained how his claims were impossible, including the ball of lightning with the man inside; he knew Barry's father was the murderer, as did numerous others. Having never asked for anything from Barry, Joe asked Barry to for once be realistic, to which Barry simply walked off, disappointed.

  <p key="72218324-226f-4285-a6bb-73e2f4a886d0">
   He returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, angry at Wells for lying to him about being the only one affected by the particle accelerator's explosion. Dr. Wells claimed to not be entirely sure, as there had been numerous amounts of radiation including anti-matter, dark energy and x-elements, all apparently theoretical prior to the event. Despite them only being theory up to that point, Wells claimed that Barry was proof otherwise. He went into more detail, explaining that they'd been looking for more "meta-humans", a term they'd coined for people like Barry. Barry brought up Clyde Mardon, whom they had to stop before he hurt anyone again. Wells cautioned Barry to keep himself safe, as Barry had the potential to unlock previously undiscovered vaccines, medicines and breakthroughs in science, yet he wished to put himself on the line and "play hero". Dr. Wells saw him as nothing special, just a boy who'd been struck by lightning.

   Upset by Harrison's words and lack of confidence, Barry called Oliver Queen, hoping to get some advice.
   He visited Oliver in Starling City, where he expressed that he believed Barry could save people, though in an entirely different way to the Arrow. As opposed to the Arrow's tough vigilantism, Barry could be a guardian angel to the people of his city, saving them "in a flash". As he speeds away, Oliver expressed his awe at Barry's powers.

  <p key="62b0ad79-6d37-47d0-8dea-252f36085c39">
   Barry headed back to Central City, to S.T.A.R. Labs. He apologized to Caitlin and Cisco, understanding that they'd lost things in the explosion, but there had been an increase in crime, presumably occurring because of the creation of meta-humans. They agreed to help, and Cisco even suggested the use of a suit he'd made, initially for a firefighter, but believed it suited Barry well. He put on the suit and raced to Mardon's farm, where they'd noticed an acute change in the weather. He saved Joe and Eddie, who'd come to investigate, after a piece of debris flew at them.

  <p key="83ab4617-57dd-4d65-a6ef-2e940f7f4272">
   With Mardon's tornado heading towards the city, with an increasing wind speed, Barry suggested that he run around the tornado in reverse in order to unravel it. Despite Caitlin and Cisco's belief that Barry might not hold up, he proceeded to run around it. Before he could run fast enough, Mardon knocked him away. Believing him to be too strong, Barry didn't think he could beat Clyde. However, as he was about to give up, Dr. Wells began communicating with him. Despite acting selfishly, Wells expressed that he truly, deeply believed that Barry was special, that he could help stop the havoc he'd created. With the confidence boost, Barry was able to run fast enough, clocking just over 700 mph, ultimately unraveling the tornado. After being knocked to the ground, both Clyde and Barry stood up. Clyde proceeded to point a gun at him, claiming them to be the same, though Barry strongly disagreed. Before he could shoot Barry, Joe intervened. The following morning, still at the crime scene, Joe and Barry discussed Barry's powers and Joe apologized, for not believing him and for also believing his father a murderer. Barry also promised not to reveal anything to Iris so as to keep her safe. Not long after, Barry visited his father in
   <a href="Iron Heights Prison.html" key="1e7f9827-771e-4d35-8805-d3c2ac378a3f" title="Iron Heights Prison">

  <p key="4f4c0534-2e8c-4a97-b875-5f6228699dd0">
   Barry continued to save citizens throughout Central City, much to the frustration of Caitlin and Joe. At his day job with the CCPD, Barry investigated a strange robbery and murder scene wherein the surveillance footage showed one man, but evidence indicated that there was at least six present. He later made a casual remark that the perp's footprints were about the same size as those of Captain Singh's but was reprimanded for it by Joe, who reminded him not to tell Iris about his ability.

  <p key="10db39a9-5f0b-4d25-b3d9-ab1d2c88d299">
   Later, Barry went to
   Stagg Industries
   with Iris, where
   Simon Stagg
   was set to receive an award from Central City University. Iris was covering the event for her journalism assignment and needed Barry to help her with the scientific parts. At the event, the armed gunmen responsible for the scene Barry had just been investigating arrived and were in the process of stealing valuables when a security guard attempted to stop them. Just before they could shoot him, Barry saved him and went after the robbers, only to lose consciousness along the way. After his fainting, this prompted the S.T.A.R. Labs scientists to investigate Barry's recent weaknesses. After a run at a "Cisco'd"
   treadmill
   , it was discovered that Barry had acute hypoglycemia, a condition that Barry developed because of his sped-up metabolism and could be remedied by a more extensive meal plan. Joe then arrived at the lab and called him out for his unnecessary heroics.
  </p>
  <p key="64e01158-577c-44a8-95cb-7c4736cb74a0">
   Because of this, Barry lost confidence in himself and, face to face with
   Danton Black
   , the meta-human that infiltrated the Stagg event, he realized that he did not have the ability to really go up against them. At this point, Iris was still trying to get Barry to tell her what was going on with him. Just when he had momentarily quit his association with Wells and the others, Iris revealed that her new journalism topic would be his alter-ego, who has been dubbed the "red streak" by citizens. Caitlin then called Barry back to S.T.A.R. Labs and told him of a way to defeat Black. Joe then arrived to convince Barry to go after him.
  </p>
  <p key="ede6b0ea-6f2d-4355-a5e3-f24628a29967">
   Barry did and followed Danton to Stagg Industries, where he intended to kill Stagg once and for all. With a pep talk from those at the Lab, including Joe, Barry was able to isolate the real Danton from the hundreds of clones and put him down. When Danton momentarily regained consciousness, he attacked Barry only to miss and hit the window. Barry tried to save him from falling but Danton, not wanting to be saved, summoned up an extra hand to pull himself from Barry's grip and fell, much to Barry's disappointment. Later, Barry commended the group at the lab, who then fully supported Barry's city-saving, even Caitlin, and made amends with Joe.

   Barry went to the movies with Iris when Cisco and Caitlin informed him of a car chase. Using his speed Barry quickly stopped the robber and returned before Iris knew he was gone. The next day Barry and Joe investigated the death of the Darbinyan crime family. Noting that as the victims were poisoned with gas they would have all died at the same time, yet some of them had time to move. This led to Barry realizing that they were dealing with another meta-human who could control gas. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Joe brought up the topic of finding a suitable prison for meta-humans. Wells and Cisco decided that the particle accelerator would be the best place to hold them until they could cure them of their powers. Caitlin, remembering the death of her fiancé Ronnie, froze in her spot. Seeing her distress, Barry offered for Caitlin to help him run tests on the poison gas they'd procured. At Barry's lab the two talked about Ronnie until the DNA results came back, revealing that the gas inside the victims also had someone else's DNA. Hearing of the murder of
   Theresa Howard
   on the police radio, Barry left despite Caitlin's pleas. Arriving at the scene, Barry found himself too late and angrily chased after the meta-human. Before he could fight him, the man transformed into gas and forced Barry to inhale him.
  </p>
  <p key="8498aae0-65ee-4e21-80ce-1ce4d08a382b">
   Rushing back to S.T.A.R. Labs, the team was able to painfully extract the gas with a needle. Despite being told to rest, Barry went to talk to Joe and confide in him about his inability to save the judge. He went on to mention his temptation to break his father out of jail, though Joe reasoned that his father would simply be a fugitive, and despite his abilities, Barry would never be able to save everyone. Later Barry apologized to Caitlin for worrying her, only for Caitlin to reveal that what he had said to her were the same last words Ronnie said before he died. Barry decided to help her overcome her fear of walking into the particle accelerator.

   After finding peace, she thanked Barry and the two embraced. Wells and Cisco soon called them up and revealed that a sedative was also found in the gas. Barry told Cisco to check if anyone was executed on the night of the particle accelerator, as the two chemicals were used when executing death-row inmates. They identified the meta-human to be
   Kyle Nimbus
   , a hit-man for the Darbinyan crime family; the family had turned on Nimbus, leading him to be arrested by Joe West and prosecuted by Judge
   Theresa Howard
   . Barry quickly suited up and headed to Iron Heights prison, saving Joe who was visiting Barry's father.

  <p key="feb59ff5-95d6-4542-9a6e-680dd9ee0664">
   Barry then went after
   The Mist
   , as Cisco proudly nicknamed him, defeating him by tiring him out (his fatigue would have forced him to revert to his human form eventually).

  <p key="f3711a60-f1b5-4afd-81c8-b1b901107f69">
   Barry later visited his father and confided in him that he missed his mother. Henry comforted him by telling him the story of how he learned to walk. Barry realized that to honor his mother he had to continue running, as he had always done.

   Barry trained the speed of his mind by multitasking by playing a game of chess with Harrison Wells, a game of Operation with Caitlin, and a game of table tennis with Cisco. Barry defeated Cisco and Caitlin but made a mistake which caused him to lose against Wells. Soon after, they had an alert of a bank robbery, to which Barry responded to quickly. At the scene, Barry managed to unmask
   Leonard Snart
   , the leader of his crew. After a guard was shot, Barry quickly rushed him to St. Andrews Hospital and quickly returned to the scene for work. When Captain Singh noted that a guard said there were three robbers, Barry corrected him to four, though he quickly justified his reasoning as it had to have been a four-man job. After Singh sarcastically thanked Barry for his insight, Joe asked if Barry saw anything that could help the case, to which Barry told Joe he saw one of them unmasked. At the precinct, Barry quickly identified Snart and learned that Snart's father was a dirty cop.

   Later when Iris brought Barry coffee, Barry was told by Iris that she began a blog about The Streak. Barry attempted to convince her to stop with the blog as it only brings crazies and trolls, but failed. Barry was shocked when he saw Felicity in his lab at the police station. He caught up with Felicity and he learned Felicity listened to his entire conversation with Oliver on the rooftop. Barry showed Felicity his powers and brought her to S.T.A.R. Labs. When asked if they could trust Felicity, Barry told Cisco and Caitlin that she works with The Arrow, reassuring them. Barry showed his powers again, using the treadmill where Barry attempted to show off by running backwards, though he failed When Barry brought Felicity to Jitters, he was invited by Iris to join her and Eddie at Trivia Night and to bring

   When Iris asked why Barry wasn't dating Felicity who she claimed to be the perfect girl for him, Barry stated that they were only friends. At trivia night, Barry and Felicity answered a majority of questions correctly. Iris then pushed Barry to ask Felicity out again, assuming Felicity was very interested in Barry based on how she dressed. After Snart was spotted, Barry left and had Felicity cover for him, though she had no excuse that could work for him. Barry arrived in time to save Joe and a few others but due to the fact he was struck by the cold gun when saving Joe, he was slowed down and failed to save a security guard.

   Barry later was furious at Cisco for building the weapon which caused the death of a man. Barry felt betrayed as he was never notified of such a weapon, and this meant he was unprepared. Barry quickly learned Cisco originally made the gun to be used on him, had he gone uncontrollable. After the team tracked Snart, Barry decided to take him on his own and turn off all communications. When Barry confronted Snart, Snart noted that Barry's weakness was his altruism; his need to always save others, rather than going after the villain. Snart froze the wheels of the train, causing it to derail as he fled. Barry, having no choice, managed to rescue all passengers though he was attacked by Snart. Before Snart could finish him, Barry was saved by Cisco, Caitlin, and Felicity. Back at

   Barry was hanging out with Cisco, Caitlin, Iris, and Eddie at a bar where he discovered that because of his high metabolism he could not get drunk. Suddenly an explosion was reported at a building Barry raced over to see a window washer about to fall, thinking of no other way to save him Barry asked Cisco and Caitlin how fast he would need to go to run up a building. They told him that if he moved at extremely fast speeds he would be fine but must maintain his speed on the way down or risk serious injury. Barry rescued the man but was seen by Iris; blurring his face so she wouldn't recognize him, he quickly left.

   Later as police investigated, Barry informed Joe that he could find no bomb casing. Searching through the files using his powers Barry found some information that pertained to the incident. Back at the police station Barry was told by Joe to give the military everything they had on the case. Barry handed the files over but, using his speed, managed to snatch one file from them. Joe told him to consult with the crew at S.T.A.R labs. At the lab Barry told them of what happened. Wells was familiar with Wade Eiling, the general leading the investigation. Wells explained that he worked with Wade to develop gene therapies for soldiers while Wells was more concerned over its benefit to civilians, only for him to sever their partnership when he found out Eiling's plans to develop mind-reading abilities for interrogation purposes. Cisco went through the army's digital records where they discovered the culprit was a woman named Bette Sans Souci, a bomb specialist for the army.

   Barry found Bette at her last known address however when tried to take her in, contact with her caused his clothes to begin to detonate. Bette told Barry to get out of his clothes before they exploded which he did, just barely escaping the blast. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs Barry told a distraught Cisco about the suit and revealed to the others she was a meta-human. Joe came to him and asked Barry why he didn't tell him Iris saw him the other night. Barry told him she caught him off guard so Joe told him to tell Iris to stop blogging about him. Barry begged Iris to stop but she refused, claiming that he himself had wanted to know about the impossible since they were young. Barry noted that she wasn't even putting her name on it; Iris told Barry only to talk to her when he was ready to tell her the truth about why he was being so skeptical.

  <p key="51c5a2c8-696b-4a5d-a50a-867494fbed54">
   Cisco and Caitlin called and told him that Bette was spotted at the location of the surgeon who experimented on her. Barry arrived just in time to save Bette from being captured. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs the others told Bette of how the Particle Accelerator explosion and how it changed her. As they examined her Caitlin discovered a tracked inside her graze wound when the army attacked her, leading Wade right to S.T.A.R. Labs. The others quickly got her out while Wells stalled Wade. Outside while testing her abilities, Bette asked Barry if the others had tried to help him find a cure. Barry told her how a friend once told him that the bolt struck him for a reason and now because of it he can help people. Joe called and told Barry that Iris put her name on her blog.

  <p key="61fc7453-a694-4a0b-82d6-868372e1430e">
   Barry confronted her as the Flash and told her to stop writing about him. Iris revealed that to him that she was writing to help Barry prove that the impossible does exist. Barry arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs where the others revealed to him and Bette that curing her was at the moment impossible. Barry suggested that she join their team but the others pointed out that Bette's powers were too destructive and could put them all in danger, despite Barry pointing out she was the first meta-human they encountered who was not a criminal or a person who deliberately used their powers to hurt others. Back at his lab in the police station Barry met up with Joe. He told him that by visiting Iris as the Flash he found out that Iris was only writing about him to help. Barry pointed out that the only way to get Iris to stop was to tell her the truth claiming he told her everything only for Joe to reveal he knew Barry had feelings for Iris since he was a child and noted that Barry has not told Iris his feelings about her.

  <p key="566251c4-927f-4d70-b5e7-ef53b90a90b3">
   Barry claimed it didn't matter since she was already dating Eddie but Joe told him that when fate wants something to happen, whether it be him getting hit by the bolt that gave him his powers or getting two people to fall in love, it works things out. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs the others told Barry that Bette had left without saying where she was going. When they finally found her about to engage Eiling and his men, Barry rushed to her location before she could kill him. As Barry talked her out of killing Eiling, the general shot her killing her. As her body began to detonate the others told Barry to get her remains out of the city. Barry asked them how fast he would have to go to run on water. The team guessed about 650 miles per hour but told him he must escape the blast once he dropped her. Barry did and just barely managed to outrun the shock wave.
  </p>
  <p key="3955f280-c52e-465e-b572-7462cbc54548">
   Later as Eiling covered up the incident Barry expressed disappointment, as Eiling had killed Bette in cold blood right in front of him and yet they could do nothing to him. Caitlin tried to comfort him telling him that running on water put him in interesting "company". Back at Joe's house Barry told Iris about his situation with Bette without telling her the specific details and asked her one more time to stop writing about The Streak. Iris once again refused, forcing Barry to tell her that they should not talk to each other for a while.
  </p>
  <p key="09db8faf-96cf-4dff-96b0-8831de286a81">
   Later Barry visited Iris once again as The Streak and tried to convince her to stop writing about him. However she ignored his request and instead tried to find out more about him. She then asked what she should call him with Barry claiming anything would be better than "The Streak". Their conversation was cut short when they heard sirens. Rushing to the crime Barry saved a kid who was about to be run over by the culprit. Cutting the criminal off, Barry discovered he was a meta-human when the man ripped the door off of the Humvee he had stolen and threw it at him. Barry dodged this and attacked the man, only for his skin to turn into a steel like substance, resulting in Barry injuring his hand and the man brutally back handing him. Beaten, Barry escaped but not before the criminal told him that he was "born to take a beating", a phrase that seemed familiar to him. Rushing back to S.T.A.R Labs, Barry passed out on the floor.

  <p key="00d0e0d7-b2d0-4aa5-bf0e-656988594ae2">
   Caitlin examined his injuries and told him he had various fractures, a concussion, and a bruised spleen, the injuries being so severe that Caitlin told him even with his healing abilities it would take a couple hours for him to recover. Barry then told them about the meta-human's abilities, and asked how he was supposed to fight a man made of steel.

   and the team assured him that they would find a way. The next day Barry reported to the Central City Police Department, where he confirmed with Joe that the metal man was indeed a meta-human. Joe told Barry that he was putting him and Eddie on the case so that Barry could explain to Eddie what he saw.
  </p>
  <p key="e80663b6-0a32-47bf-acea-2266221d8a50">
   Barry then went to see the Central City District Attorney, who identified the "man of steel" as Tony Woodward. Barry recognized the name; Woodward was a former classmate of Barry and Iris’, who bullied Barry throughout his childhood. After the meeting, Barry and Eddie ran into Iris. Eddie asks Barry what's going on between Iris and him, not knowing that Barry was avoiding Iris but Barry told him everything was fine.
  </p>
  <p key="2fce17b8-0912-4ffe-ac88-f37f269f93e3">
   At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry was introduced to a girder dummy built by Cisco so Barry could learn the right speed to take down Tony Woodward. Barry was easily defeated and dislocated his shoulder in the process. Shortly after, he was called by Eddie who had found the missing Humvee. Barry responded and as he arrived, Eddie recommended that he should get a car. Eddie then asked what's happening between him and Iris again where Barry revealed they had a fight.
  </p>
  <p key="c6cb63dd-ce19-4fe2-858b-af82dedef375">
   Barry and Eddie then headed to
   Rusty Iron Ale Brewing Co.
   after suspecting he had dropped by there due to the kegs in the trunk. After questioning a few men at the brewery, one man ran, Barry and Eddie chasing him. Barry ran in front of the two, where the man punched Barry though it slowed him down enough for Eddie to take the man down. They then learn that Tony supposedly died in an accident, though they revealed to the man that he lived. Barry visited Iris at Jitters again where he told her that Tony is an example of why she should stop blogging about him. As the cops arrived, Barry ran off to Tony's hideout.
  </p>
  <p key="a251965e-d5f1-4923-97ca-10c535e1d3e1">
   Barry was easily defeated by Tony and rendered unconscious. After he was brought back to S.T.A.R. Labs, he was yelled at by Harrison Wells who reminded him that they were still finding a way to stop him. Barry was then told that they had found a way to stop Tony and that is to hit him at 837 mph. At the precinct, Barry and Eddie discussed being victims of bullying as kids, while blowing off steam using a punching bag. They were soon told that Iris was missing and the two quickly rushed to help. After learning a fire alarm went off at his old elementary school, Barry quickly realized that was where Tony and Iris were. Barry fought Tony but was once again defeated. Barry then ran away from the school, 5.3 miles exactly, then ran back towards the school, breaking the sound barrier and knocking Tony down. Barry then greeted an incarcerated Tony, revealing his identity and told him that the particle accelerator made them who they truly were.

  <p key="3def4555-641a-4a4e-a3d5-a72125352bcd">
   After walking away from the makeshift prison, Barry celebrated as he had finally had his revenge on Tony. Barry then greeted Iris at Jitters and the two reconcile. When Iris told Barry more about "The Streak", she told him how he comes and goes in the blink of an eye, and Barry interrupted her saying he does it in "A Flash".

  <p key="bc58ace7-4886-4183-9ddb-035155f507de">
   Barry went for an early morning coffee run at Jitters, though a trainee was working that morning. After a woman complained about it, Barry sped past and got everyone their coffee and left a large tip for the trainee. As he left Jitters, a man grabbed him and asked for his wallet. Barry laughed at the man, as he chose him out of everyone else in the city. Barry proceeded to take a majority of the man's clothes off and brought a police officer to him as he ran away. Barry later was called to a crime scene where a man was burned to death. Joe said Barry had to ID him though Eddie asked how Barry was going to do so with the man's face melted off.

  <p key="879f33fc-a394-4a68-9f30-0f0db6f36b44">
   Barry then bragged about his "mad skills". Barry then brought the photo of the man to S.T.A.R. Labs, where they managed to ID the man as
   Casey Donahue
   . Shortly after, the man's ID was used at an electrical plant, which Barry quickly responded to. When Barry arrived, he encountered
   Farooq Gibran
   , a meta-human who has the ability to drain electricity. Barry made a few attempts to avoid his attacks though he was soon struck by Farooq. Barry later tried to run away, though to his surprise, he had lost his super speed. At S.T.A.R. Labs, they had tested him on the treadmill, though to everyone's surprise, Barry ran slow, even for a normal person.

  <p key="3673329c-bf70-4f5e-b5d6-adf59ed25d08">
   Barry warned Barry about the meta-human who siphoned his abilities and killed the man. Barry later bumped into
   William Tockman
   at the precinct, who had complimented him for his watch. At S.T.A.R. Labs, they managed to identify the meta-human who shortly arrived at the lab, demanding to see Harrison Wells. Wells shortly told Barry that they could try jump starting him to regain his speed which Barry quickly agrees to. When Farooq broke into the lab, Barry tried to talk sense into him but Farooq only struck Barry. Cisco managed to close the doors to hold Farooq off for a short while. Barry and Caitlin then went to the treadmill to jump-start his powers. When Cisco turned the power back on, Caitlin was hesitant to follow through as she was afraid he would die.

  <p key="e1e9f8e4-7108-4a5a-b728-a77f2d8aad18">
   Barry told Caitlin that if she doesn't follow through they would all die. When Caitlin made an attempt to jump start Barry, they learned that it had failed. Barry and Caitlin then witnessed Tony get defeated by Farooq. Barry asked what he was doing outside of the prison where Tony reminded him he never steps away from a fight. Tony then told Barry and Caitlin to get out as Tony died. Barry was then furious at Wells, who had used Tony to buy some time. They then noticed that Barry's cells were still regenerating though Barry still didn't have his speed. Cisco and Caitlin then believed the reason he had yet to regain his speed was because it was mental and he didn't believe enough. When they made an attempt to escape the lab, they were attacked by Farooq. Wells then finally faced Farooq.

  <p key="63e8bbc8-6f73-4234-8a11-5506cd9761ce">
   When Farooq attacked Wells, Barry finally believed enough to regain his speed and save Wells. Barry faced Farooq once more but this time he has connected to his powers and the energy overwhelmed Farooq, killing him. Barry then rushed to the precinct, worrying that something had happened to Iris. He was relieved when he saw her safe in Joe's arms. After they locked up Farooq's body, Caitlin noticed that Barry's cells were regenerating faster than before. Barry payed Eddie a visit at the hospital. After Iris left to grab a coffee, Barry briefly left and had a conversation with Iris as the Flash. Barry then told Iris he would never be late again and that Iris is worth being on time for. Barry then ran off and returned to Eddie's hospital room.

   Barry arrived at a bank that
   Roy Bivolo
   was robbing, only to find everyone attacking each other. Barry managed to save a man from being shot just as everyone began to recover. When Joe and a few other police arrived at the scene, Barry suggested to Joe that the people were "whammied". At the precinct, Barry learned that Eddie finally believed the Flash's existence though he learned Eddie believes he's a menace. Barry proceeded to steal Captain Singh's lunch as he went to S.T.A.R. Labs to discuss the new meta-human. Shortly after, Iris called him out through her blog. Before Barry left, Caitlin told him not to get involved in Iris and Eddie's relationship as he would be responsible for their breakup. When Barry arrived at Jitters, he told Iris his name was Ralph.

   Barry was warned by Iris that Eddie was pushing to get him behind bars. Barry managed to get to the storage facility Roy was hiding at before Joe and two other police officers could be killed. Barry was then greeted by Oliver, who had arrived in time to injure a "whammied" police officer. Barry then raced to the barn Oliver, Felicity, and Diggle were hiding at. When he arrived, he bragged how he gave Oliver a half an hour head start, yet still beat him. Barry asked the three what they were doing in Central City where he learned they were investigating a homicide which possibly connected to Central City, due to the material of the boomerang used to kill. Barry suggested that the two teams should work together, though

Barry was later told by Harrison and Joe not to trust Oliver as they feared he was too dangerous. The following day, Barry met up with Oliver and Felicity at CC Jitters, where Barry learned that Oliver had helped get the name of the meta-human. Barry was then asked by Iris how he knew Oliver Queen. She then sarcastically said that Oliver's arms were twice the size of his and told him that Oliver was on her top 3 cheat list. Barry was then glad when Oliver decided to work along with him.

   The following day, Barry arrived late for the training, despite his speed. Barry was told by Oliver that he always ran in blind and he has a lot to learn. Barry was told to run a distance and run back where he'd get shot by an arrow where Barry told Oliver he wasn't going to be shot. Barry proved him wrong by catching the arrow though he was struck in the back by 2 bolts which Oliver had set up. At the precinct, Barry was told once again not to trust the Arrow, though Barry defended him, saying he's the reason they had Bivolo's name. Barry then decided to cut off the partnership and go after Roy himself. Barry was whammied by Roy but he believed there was no effect on him. Barry proceeded to bring up Ronnie in front of Caitlin. He later met up with Oliver where he told him that he believed Oliver was jealous of him. At the precinct, Barry lashed out at Captain Singh. Later on, Barry attacked Eddie and threw him out of Iris' car. As he was about to beat Eddie, Barry was hit by a trick Arrow from Oliver.

  <p key="8298e956-c44e-45af-a22e-daf718652747">
   Barry then pulled the rope from the arrow and dragged Oliver down an alley. When Oliver fired two arrows, Barry dodged them, believing Oliver had missed, though he failed to realize there was an electricity box behind him. Oliver then injected Barry with two thousand milligrams of horse tranquilizer, though his metabolism burned it all off. Barry then ran circles around Oliver and as Oliver used one of his arrows to get on the roof, Barry reached the roof first and knocked Oliver down. Barry then dodged a few hits from Oliver before punching him several times. Barry then caught two arrows which Oliver had set up to his motorbike.

   Barry was then shot in the leg with a flechette and then held by Oliver as Joe and Harrison arrived to reverse the effects from Bivolo. Barry and Oliver went on to take down Bivolo and look him in the prison in S.T.A.R. Labs. The following day at Jitters, Barry apologized to Oliver for his actions and his words, but was then told by Oliver that guys like them can never get the girl because of what they do. Barry visited Iris at Jitters though he learned Captain Singh has called the task force to bring him in. Iris proceeded to tell him she doesn't want to see him again after what he did to Eddie. Barry then ran off into the night.

   Barry told Oliver that he had begun to approach cases more carefully rather than just running into them. Oliver then accepted his help and told Barry they needed to reassemble the boomerangs to which Barry did swiftly. Barry and Oliver visited Quentin Lance where Quentin had forgotten his name and believed it to be "Bart". Quentin also believed that Barry was hit by a bus, rather than lightning, though Barry corrected Quentin. Barry asked Quentin about
   Klaus Markos

   When Barry returned, he admitted that he should have listened to Harrison Wells and Joe West. When Oliver told him that Starling City isn't always sunny and that he had friends and family murdered, Barry interrupted Oliver, saying he watched his mother get murdered also. Barry then told Oliver that he doesn't use his own personal tragedies to torture whoever pissed him off. Oliver then made it clear to him if his way of dealing with criminals was too hard then Barry was not allowed to stay and help. When they believed they had tracked Digger Harkness, Barry and Oliver arrived at the warehouse, though they realized that they were played. When they returned, they found Lyla in critical condition where Barry rushed her to Starling General Hospital. After Oliver blamed himself, Barry reassured him it wasn't his fault.

   When Oliver told Barry that everything he had been through taken away his humanity, Barry told him his humanity is what got him through everything. Barry and Oliver arrived later arrived a the train station where they had tracked Digger. Digger told them that they can stop him, or 5 bombs from detonating. Barry left to defuse the bombs while Oliver dealt with Digger. When Barry arrived at the first bomb, the team quickly realized that the bombs are linked and if one is defused, the remaining will detonate. Cisco told Barry that he needed to cut all 5 wires at the same time though Barry reminded him he wasn't Multiplex. Barry then quickly grabbed Felicity, Caitlin, Roy, and Cisco to the other four bombs where the five of them managed to cut the wires simultaneously and stop the bombs from detonating. At the arrow-cave, Barry was surprised when he had a mannequin set up for a future team-up. When Oliver said he will still be calling the shots, Barry told him that they'll see about it. Barry and Oliver then went to a warehouse to settle once and for all, who would win in a fight. Before the dueled, Barry told Oliver that he could still inspire people, but as Oliver Queen. Barry managed to catch two arrows from Oliver before charging towards him and dodging multiple arrows.

The two race down towards a stadium where they battled though Reverse-Flash quickly defeated Barry. Barry asked the Reverse-Flash who he really was but the man claimed Barry already knew who he was, that they had been fighting each other for years. As Barry tries to fight back the Reverse-Flash subdued him and told Barry it was his destiny to die at his hands, just like it was mother's.

Barry visited his father and told him that he had found the man who murdered Nora. When he apologized for failing to catch the man, his father reassured him that it wasn't his fault. Barry was then told to stop pursuing that man as everything that happened to Barry was influenced by the murder.

He then had Cisco fire a missile, which Barry successfully grabbed and threw towards the drone. Shortly after Snart re-emerged, Barry quickly realized Snart was setting a trap for the Flash. Barry vowed to take Snart down but Wells told Barry to set his priorities straight and focus on taking the Reverse-Flash down. Barry went to Joe and told him he was going to focus on the Reverse-Flash and left Snart to Wells and Cisco, much to Joe's dismay. At S.T.A.R.

   with ease. When he returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, the team took a group photo. After Wells was attacked by
   Hartley Rathaway
   , Barry went over to his mansion. When he noticed the shatter of the glass, he realized it couldn't have been a teenage prank. At his lab at CCPD, Barry demonstrated how Hartley likely used some sonic technology when he attacked Wells. After Eddie reported an attack on
   Rathaway Industries
   , Caitlin called Barry but Barry told Caitlin he already knew why she was calling.

   Barry quickly took down Rathaway, who told Barry he can hear Cisco, Caitlin, and Wells through the radio waves. After Wells admitted he knew the chance of failure of the particle accelerator, Barry told Wells he owed Caitlin and Cisco more than an apology, as they stuck around when everyone abandoned him. Later that night, Barry and Iris had a coffee at Jitters discussing how people they admire aren't who they seem to be. When Hartley broke out of the prison, Barry rushed to S.T.A.R. Labs though Hartley had left by then. When Hartley attacked the
   Keystone Cleveland Dam
   , Barry rushed over and arrived in time to save a woman who Hartley threw off. Hartley used the data on Barry's molecular scans to stop Barry once he was disarmed. Hartley was then stopped after the team hacked into the frequencies after the cars at the dam to send out waves powerful enough to stop Hartley. When Wells told Barry he wished to regain the trust of the team one day, Barry told him he already had.

   Barry saved a couple from a burning car, Cisco told Barry he couldn't be mad for dirtying his suit, to which Barry asked when he could start calling it "his" suit. While Barry was investigating
   Clay Parker
   , he was greeted by his father. When Barry brought the DNA samples to S.T.A.R. Labs, they realized
   Shawna Baez
   was also involved. Barry and Caitlin discuss how they both don't have much of a social life where they were interrupted with a sighting of Shawna Baez and Clay Parker. Barry rushed to the scene and was shocked when he learned Shawna can teleport. He was shot at in the neck by Clay Parker but managed to stop the bullet, though the two escaped. Barry stopped by to help Iris with a report, though she already had plans with Eddie.

  <p key="6b245885-85fe-4c7b-9a20-898b7ef66ada">
   Barry then decided to drop by a south-side dive bar with Caitlin to check if Shawna and Clay returned to old habits. After Caitlin had a few drinks, she walked up to the stage drunk and called Barry out to join her. The two then sang "Summer Nights" where Caitlin was shocked Barry could sing well. After their duet, Barry was greeted by

    Linda Park

   Julius
   .
  </p>
  <p key="4c3add7e-93e2-4e9b-9489-010aa9910cde">
   Barry asked who attacked him and went after Julius. Barry broke Julius out and told him he wouldn't return him to prison, causing him to face more time if he didn't give him Clay and Shawna's next heist. After Barry was told they were in St. Louis, Barry decided to leave Julius out for beating his father. While chasing Clay and Shawna, Barry busts out all the lights in the tunnel they were in, disabling Shawna's teleportation abilities and locking her in a one way glass. Later, Barry decided to call Linda Park and asked her to go on a date. Barry gave Iris information on Clay Parker to use for a report for the
   Central City Picture News
   . He then picked Linda up and the two go for a date. That night, Barry went back to Iron Heights to check on his dad. When Henry began putting the pieces together that Barry was the Flash, Barry claimed he would've told his dad if he was the Flash. Barry was then told that the world is dangerous and told to be careful and that his father was proud of him for saving many lives.

   Barry took Linda on a dinner date at a Mexican restaurant. While Linda went to wash her hands, Barry was notified of a robbery at a convenient store and quickly settled the robbery. The following day, Barry had another date with Linda but had to end the date early after Wells and Caitlin spotted Firestorm. Barry tried to stop Firestorm and told him they could help but Firestorm attacked Barry and flew off. Barry and Caitlin then tried a different approach, bring Martin Stein's wife along this time, which Martin finally agreed to get help. Linda called Barry to break up with him as she felt he didn't care enough in the relationship as he often ran off and made excuses. Linda told Barry that it's hard to date someone new when you aren't over someone and understood.

  <p key="28996e4d-9713-43ef-b613-7574940af5c6">
   Barry went to ask Iris why she told Linda he had feelings for her still and told Iris he no longer had feelings for her. At S.T.A.R. Labs, the team learn that Ronnie and Martin could go nuclear and level the entire city, unless the host body was killed. Barry went to offer Ronnie/Martin some pleasantries though Ronnie told Barry he overheard the conversation. Barry went to Central City Picture News and told Linda he was going to eat a ghost pepper if she didn't agree on another date. Barry took a bite after she believed he was bluffing and Linda agreed to go on another date and offered him some milk. Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs and the team decide to use a quantum splicer on them two separate but learn Martin had left already. Barry and Caitlin rush over to Martin and the two told Martin that they have a way to separate them.

  <p key="f4fc4813-c4e7-4ef2-9e54-c2969d2b953f">
   After the quantum splicer was placed, Firestorm reacting, believing they had failed, Barry grabbed Caitlin and ran off to safety as an explosion set off.

   After they got to safety, Caitlin worried they were exposed to radiation, though Cisco informed them there were none. They went back and were pleased when they learned they successfully separated and took them back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Barry was contacted by Joe and was informed what he learned with Cisco the previous day. They brought the news to Wells who told them
   time travel
   is indeed possible. Barry then went to ask more about time travel with Martin Stein who suddenly had a panic attack when General Eiling attacked CC Jitters.
  </p>
  <p key="3776b87b-e770-4f8a-af49-07a7f968d64d">
   Barry rushed over to stop Eiling but the latter used kinetic needles to stop Barry. They later learn that Martin and Ronnie are still connected. At his home, Barry asked how Joe knew whose blood sample to match and was told that Joe asked Cisco to match the sample with everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs. Barry then told Joe to not worry as he was sure Wells had nothing to do with his mother's murder. After Martin was captured, the team track him down and Barry, along with Ronnie go to rescue Martin. Barry was hit with a weaponized phosphorous and began running in circles to burn it off. After Eiling had the upper hand, he prepared to kill Firestorm though Barry stopped Eiling in time and Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs with Firestorm. Later, Barry told Joe that when the time came, he wouldn't fail like he believed he had in the past and he would save his mother.

   After Barry loses a USB drive containing information on various crime scenes and searches for it at S.T.A.R. Labs with little success, but his attention was quickly diverted when Cisco told him of a possible metahuman,
   <a href="Mari.html" key="cf09729f-16eb-40e2-a269-3ae764315b8c" title="Mari">
    Mari McCabe

However Cisco also informs Barry that Mari was currently living in Detroit and not knowing what to expect Barry went to Oliver for help and the two headed to Detroit to confirm whether or not she is a threat. Flash and Arrow arrived at the house of Mari's foster father
   Chuck
   but when she saw the vigilantes she immediately ran and they gave chase. Flash gave chase to Mari whose speed was just as fast as his and asked her to stop but she refused and displayed incredible strength caused Flash to fly back several blocks, but eventually resumed the chase with Arrow. Mari then displayed the ability to run up a building forcing Flash and Arrow to take the fight to the rooftops. Despite the combined efforts Mari continued to outrun Flash and dodge Arrow's shots, even crushing his arrows with her bare hands.
  </p>
  <p key="8e11ba72-5c78-4aa3-949d-3cf618e2d633">
   Mari also displayed the ability to camouflage but Arrow attempted to restrain her with a jettisoning arrow but she outran it, only to slip off the side of the building but then displayed the ability of flight which highly impressed Flash. As Mari attempted to fly away Arrow convinced her to come back as they just wanted to talk, though Flash wanted to handle the talking claiming to be better at it but Arrow simply reminded him he just puts meta-humans in the pipeline. However Mari shot down Flash and Arrow's claim that she was a meta-human claiming that she wasn't in Central City when the particle accelerator exploded, which Felicity was able to confirm. Though Flash was unconvinced Arrow offered their help to Mari to understand what she can do but she turned them down as she was uninterested and warned them that if they ever showed up at Chuck's house again, she'd kill them and flew off.

   Ignoring Mari's warning Flash and Arrow returned later to her house, where they discovered she'd become a vigilante herself, and Arrow questioned her intentions to take on Detroit's criminals without training. However Mari convinced them to let her try things her way for a while and Arrow agreed and wished her luck as Flash reminded her they could still help if she needed them to. After Mari asked if they had an idea of a name for her Flash told her that Cisco had been calling her Vixen, and he quickly tried to cover up mentioning Cisco causing Arrow to ask if Barry and Felicity were separated at birth. Arrow also learned that Flash kissed her causing him to speed off in worry.

   Barry took Linda bowling where they bumped into Iris and Eddie. The two join them but later, Eddie and Barry were called after a silent alarm went off at the
   Central City Morgue
   . Barry ran ahead and investigated the crime scene prior to returning as his CSI job and on his way, he noticed another Flash running beside him. After listening to a recording, they learned that it was Mark Mardon who attacked the Morgue. The following day, while Barry and Joe were discussing over a drive, they were attacked by Mark Mardon, though Barry got Joe to safety in time. Barry and Iris later went to CC Jitters where the latter told Barry that she suspects Wells had to do with Stagg's murder. Barry told Iris that Wells is a great man and she won't find such a story. Barry later told Cisco and Caitlin from what he heard from Iris but still denied the fact that Wells had involvement in Stagg's disappearance. After Mark attacked the precinct, Barry ran over in time to stop Mardon with the
   Wizard's Wand
   , though Mark escaped. The following day, Barry dropped by and conversed with Mason Bridge about Harrison Wells.
  </p>
  <p key="f8bdab65-54fc-4162-9904-94c09c1c13ca">
   Barry asked Mason what evidence he had on Wells and was told to read about it like everyone else. After Joe was kidnapped and held hostage by Mark Mardon, the latter called Iris to meet him at the waterfront. Barry went to help Iris. Linda stopped by the precinct to talk to Barry, though Barry told Linda there was something more important, though not what she thought was going on. At the waterfront, realizing the danger, Barry told Iris to get out and get to safety, though Iris confessed her love for Barry. The two share a kiss before Barry revealed his alter-ego to Iris. To stop Mark Mardon's wave from destroying the city, Barry ran back and forth the seawall to create a barrier of wind and doing so, he accidentally traveled back in time as he watched his past self run towards the morgue.

  <p key="92b4ef7e-478f-4292-b921-c5d177abe25b">
   At the morgue, Barry was confused at what was going on, quickly solving everything. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry finished off everyone's sentences and Wells quickly realized that Barry had traveled back in time. Wells then warned Barry to not alter any events, big or small as it could cause a cataclysm. Ignoring Wells instructions, Barry tracked down Mark Mardon and brought him to the S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator prison. Wells told Barry that even though he may have saved many lives, time would find a way to repair itself. Barry ran as fast as he did previously in an attempt to go back once again, though to no success. At Central City Picture News, Linda told Barry that she knows he still had feelings for Iris and broke up with him, though wished him luck with Iris. Barry then told Mason he knew he suspected something wrong with Wells. Later that night, Barry and Cisco grab a drink but Barry ended up leaving Cisco with
   <a href="Lisa Snart.html" key="b63e142f-05d2-4d1e-bdb4-a29a61a941bf" title="Lisa Snart">
    Lisa

   After a report of Snart and the
   Santini crime family casino
   , Barry rushed over and held Lisa hostage. Snart told Barry to let her go as he told Barry he has Cisco hostage. After the two left, Barry returned to the labs as a CSI where he was punched by Eddie for trying to win Iris over earlier. The following day, Cisco showed up at S.T.A.R. Labs and quit, feeling guilt for revealing Barry's identity. Barry told Cisco that he shouldn't feel sorry but Cisco still felt the guilt. Barry and Caitlin later realize the casino wasn't the target but a way to trigger a money transfer. Barry chased after Leonard, Lisa, and Mick and captured Leonard. Barry told Leonard he could lock him up for good but Leonard told him then there would be no way of stopping his broadcast of him revealing Barry's identity. Barry told Leonard that if he was good as he claimed he is, he shouldn't need to kill. Barry then told Leonard if he hurt anyone close to him, he would go after him, no matter who Leonard told his secret to. At Jitters, Eddie apologized to Barry for hitting him and learned that Caitlin told Iris and Eddie about his "lightning psychosis". Barry later went to ask Wells about Stagg but before he could ask, he saw a report of Mason Bridge missing. He later called Joe and admitted that he was right about Wells.

   Barry and Joe discuss over Wells and while Barry believed he could be the Reverse-Flash, Joe told Barry that the blood at the house didn't match his. Barry then rushed over to a terrorist attack by
   Axel Walker
   , who claimed himself as the Trickster. They learn that Axel is a copycat of
   James Jesse
   , who had killed 10 civilians and 2 cops prior and now facing life sentences at Iron Heights. Barry and Joe head over to Iron Heights where James Jesse told them Axel likely found his lair. On their way out, Barry stopped by his father's cell and told him he has gotten closer than he had before in investigating his mother's murder. Iris later called the Flash to ask for help for the investigation on Mason Bridge's disappearance. Axel then made an address that he had planted a bomb somewhere in Central City. When Barry couldn't find the bomb, Wells told him it was a trick but Barry refused to listen. As Barry kept looking, Wells theory was indeed correct as Axel broke James Jesse out and took Henry Allen hostage.

  <p key="ba3f23d7-f2a1-4865-969d-7cc7af2c768b">
   Upset his father is held hostage and possibly killed, Joe was comforted by Barry and while the latter no longer trusted Wells, Joe told Barry it didn't matter why Wells was helping and the only thing that mattered was that he did. After they tracked down the Tricksters, Barry ran over but Axel planted a kinetic bomb so if Barry didn't run over 600 mph, the bomb would go off. Barry was told by Wells to phase through a wall but Barry refused to listen. Wells told Barry to feel the power and electricity and that he was now part of a speed force. Barry ran through a truck, getting the kinetic bomb off and returned to City Hall to give everyone an antidote. Barry then went to rescue his father before knives could drop on him. Barry then confirmed his father's prediction that he is indeed the Flash. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Henry thanked Wells for taking care of Barry, though Barry didn't seem to happy. The two share a hug before Henry was brought back to Iron Heights. At the precinct, Barry revealed his identity to Eddie and told Eddie to get Iris to stop looking in on Mason Bridge. Barry then described Wells' speech and deduced that he is indeed the Reverse-Flash.

   Barry, Eddie, and Joe quickly took down a group of robbers and apprehended them. The following day, they went to
   Hudson University

   Bill Carlisle
   was attacked at
   Folston Tech
   but Barry was too late by the time he got there. He was then attacked by
   Brie Larvan

  <p key="7d5bb854-b6f3-40d2-aef3-a8a639f59f03">
   After things at dinner went downhill with Eddie and Iris, Barry was called back to S.T.A.R. Labs where they learned the bee's were all robotic. At Jitters, Felicity told Barry to inform Caitlin and Cisco about Wells, though Barry told Felicity it could backfire. Barry later told Iris to trust Eddie and that Eddie only wants to keep her in the light. The team later learned Brie went to her next target, Tina McGee and Barry went to Brie's hideout while Ray went to save Tina. Brie sent bee's to attack Barry but Felicity hacked into the software and shut the bee's down and restrained Brie. Barry rushed over to Cisco after he was stung by a bee and vibrated his hand to use as a defibrillator.

  <p key="fca0ca01-e81e-45b9-8ac9-2fee8e38741f">
   After Tina thanked Barry for the help, Barry asked what happened between her and Wells and learned one day Wells became a completely different person. Barry later called Caitlin and Cisco over and told them about why he and Joe had learned about Wells. When Caitlin was hesitant to believe them, Cisco told them he has had dreams of Wells murdering him.

   Barry ran over to Coast City and returned to Central City with pizza. At Joe's house, they inform the rest of the team that Joe and Cisco are headed to Starling City to investigate Wells. Later, Eddie called Barry when there was a report of a male who was trying to sell jewelry which was stolen the night before. Barry rushed over but learned the man was a shape-shifting meta-human. When the team feared the meta-human could copy Barry's powers, they told him to keep his hands off him. When Caitlin went to Wells' mansion, Barry rushed over and took her away and told her not to tell Wells anything. Eddie and Barry went to contact
   Mrs. Bates
   though soon realize it was actually
   Hannibal Bates
   . After Hannibal framed Eddie, Barry ran Eddie out of the precinct and told him S.T.A.R. Labs could keep him off the grid until they cleared his name but Eddie told him to do it the right way and Barry returned him to the precinct. Barry later got a visit from Eddie and was told Captain Singh called in a favor.

  <p key="0642a8f2-947d-43ff-85a4-c6cb3e883f8c">
   As Barry turned his back, Eddie, who actually was Hannibal, hit Barry and hid him. Barry was later found by Caitlin and they return to S.T.A.R. Labs. Caitlin presented Barry with a serum which could disable his shape-shifting abilities. They then got a ping from Barry's phone at the airport and Barry ran over. Barry quickly spotted Hannibal and the two quickly fought before Hannibal was shot with the serum. Barry later gave DA

   a full list of everyone Hannibal had impersonated. Later, Joe and Cisco presented with their discovery in Starling City, the corpse of the real
   Harrison Wells
   . Upon seeing this Barry realized that Tina's words about Wells being a different person were true as the "Wells" they knew was an impostor. While Cisco was looking through the schematics of S.T.A.R. Labs, they spotted a hidden room. As they entered the room, they saw the
   Reverse-Flash suit
   as well as an article from 2024 reporting the disappearance of the Flash.
  </p>
  <p key="bba264d6-af59-493c-9592-963bb6f84a32">
   They realized that "Wells" was from the future. Barry, Caitlin and Cisco were then greeted by
   <a href="Gideon (time vault).html" key="521a8aa1-1636-4366-a97a-9b44b9c0de9a" title="Gideon (time vault)">
    Gideon
   </a>
   who told Barry of his future. Barry, hoping to get some information out of it asked why Wells came to this timeline. Gideon revealed the grim, cold-hard truth; he came here to kill Barry. When they learn Wells was on his way, Barry quickly asked why he killed Nora Allen that night, where Gideon revealed that he did so out of anger after Barry escaped from him. When Wells was heading to the Time Vault, they quickly left. The team then help Cisco see his "dream" properly by constructing glasses that allowed lucid dreaming. At the precinct, Eddie asked Barry to ask Joe why he did not give his blessing for his proposal to Iris. Later, while Cisco was in his lucid dream, the team learned Wells' true identity, Eobard Thawne, who called them shortly after Cisco woke up. Eobard told him of a fire that just broke out and Barry rushed over. When Barry was unsure what to do, Eobard guided him to use his arms like a vacuum by rotating them fast enough.
  </p>
  <p key="9498e58b-182c-4cc7-9434-1de72496981a">
   Later, Eobard told Barry that the only thing stopping him from achieving his goals, 9s himself. Barry later told Joe that they need to recreate the events that happened in Cisco's dream. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Cisco had rigged the force field so instead of keeping a speedster in, it kept them out, which Barry had tested. Later, when Eobard returned from his lecture, Eobard managed to enter the force-field. As he prepared to kill Cisco, Joe fired three bullets at him, though Barry stopped most of them. The final one Barry was unable to reach and Eobard was shot and killed. Barry was upset that Eobard would never be able to confess however, it turned out to be Hannibal Bates.
  </p>
  <p key="4d460aef-fedd-460e-b4fb-b47326b1cbef">
   They were then reminded by Eobard that he was always one step ahead. Barry told Eobard he could kill him if he'd just let his father out but Eobard told Barry he needed Barry alive. Cisco got a ping from Eobard's time vault and Barry ran over. Barry learned Eobard had camera's everywhere and had access to CCTV footage. Barry warned the team before running over to save Eddie and Iris. Eobard captured Eddie as Barry arrived. Barry told Iris everything was going to be ok and swore that he would bring Eddie home. As he ran off, Barry sent a static shock, much like he had when he was in a coma as Iris realized who the Flash really is.

   Barry looked everywhere for Eddie but to no success. When Captain Singh asked where Eddie was, Barry and Joe told Eddie was taking personal time off. When the gold reserve was being attacked by Grodd, who had controlled Eiling, Barry ran over but was quickly stopped as Grodd "whammied" both Eiling and Barry. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, the team was greeted by Iris, much to the team's shock. Barry explained to Iris that there had been many times he wanted to tell Iris his secret but learned that Joe was right.
  </p>
  <p key="3b51fbc2-ede6-4e5a-b56d-7a10dca224e5">
   Barry and the CCPD later set a trap and capture Eiling. They locked him in the meta-human prison and learn he was controlled by Grodd. With the help of Iris, they learn of sewer workers going missing and Barry, Joe, and Cisco headed down to look for Grodd. Barry was whammied and knocked unconscious and Joe was kidnapped by Grodd. Later, Barry had Cisco build a tech so Grodd couldn't get into his head again. When Iris told Barry that he had been lying to her on the things that mattered most, Barry told Iris she had been lying about her feelings for him also. Barry cut himself off when he realized he couldn't have told Iris about the other timeline. Barry went 5.3 miles away from Grodd and ran toward him in an attempt for a super-sonic punch, though he had failed as Grodd cut his distance down.
  </p>

   Grodd threw Barry on a train track and as Barry's tech broke, Grodd had gotten into Barry's mind once again. As a train went toward Barry, Iris told Barry that he could defeat Grodd and save Joe. Inspired by Iris' words, Barry got out of the tracks on time and as the train passed, challenged Grodd. As Grodd jumped toward him, Barry got out of the way and another train passed and hit Grodd. Barry saved Joe and freed Eiling from the meta-human prison. Barry later told Iris that it's the thought of her that always kept him going. Iris then told Barry that she did have feelings for Barry but Eddie is her boyfriend and missing. Barry then told Iris that he would do the best he could to bring him back.

   After continuously searching, Barry told Iris he has yet to still find Eddie but promised he was trying his best. Barry was then called by Cisco who had learned Eobard had been using his wheelchair to absorb Barry's speed. When they learned the particle accelerator was turned on, they realize the reason they couldn't find Eddie and Eobard was because Eobard was holding Eddie hostage at S.T.A.R. Labs. When they opened the particle accelerator, Eobard escaped and Barry chased after him, though Eobard had gotten away. Later Barry apologized to Eddie for not finding him sooner.

   . Desperate, Barry looked to Leonard Snart to help transfer the meta-humans, under one condition, Barry erase all criminal records of him, though Joe was very disappointed Barry looked to such lengths. They had the meta-humans placed in a truck owned by Cisco's family and used the device from Eobard's wheelchair to disable the meta-humans powers temporarily. Once they reached the hangar, the meta-humans had escaped and began attacking Barry, Cisco, Caitlin, and Joe. They then learned it was Leonard who had sabotaged the truck and let the meta-humans escape. Leonard told Barry he had done so as they all now owe him and could be useful as a part of his Rogues Gallery. When Barry asked why he had spared him, Leonard told him he now owes him as well.

   At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry felt guilt having his plan failed and wondered how Oliver could do whatever it took to get what he needed. The particle accelerator then was fully charged and online. Eobard approached S.T.A.R. Labs and Barry ran out to face him. Eobard told Barry he couldn't stop him if he had tried as Eobard was always faster. Barry was then joined by Firestorm and Oliver. Barry and Eobard faced off as Oliver tried to get a clear shot at Eobard. Barry was thrown towards a S.T.A.R. Labs sign and as Eobard used his hands as a vacuum to blow Firestorm away, Barry ran over to grab Firestorm. Barry ran back and stopped Eobard before he could kill Oliver. Barry and Eobard fought on the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs and Eobard was thrown off S.T.A.R. Labs by Firestorm.Eobard was then shot by Oliver with another nanite arrow, disabling Eobard's speed and making him unconscious. Barry thanked Oliver and Firestorm for their help and looked over Eobard, finally taking down the man who murdered his mother.

   Barry asked why Eobard he murdered his mother, Eobard told him he hates him for something future Barry had done. He reveals that killing Nora was not his original intention, as he really went back 15 years to kill Barry when he was still a child. When Barry got his past self to safety, Thawne was so angry that he took it out on Nora by killing her. Eobard then told both of them could get what they want, Barry return to save his mother which would allow Eobard to return to his time. Barry presented this information to the team who all agreed he should do so. Barry asked Joe why he was so supportive and Joe told him though he had been a great son, he wants Barry growing up with his mother and his real father. Barry told his father he could save his mother but Henry told him it was to dangerous due to the repercussions of

   Iris told Barry she knew of a possible future of them being married in the future and joked she was never a fan of hyphenated names. Eobard explained how Barry was going to go back to the night his mother was murdered, he warned Barry that he could die if he didn't reach the right velocity. Later, Barry was informed that as well as dying, Barry could cause a singularity which could destroy earth and continue even after the earth is gone. Barry along with the rest of the team attended Ronnie and Caitlin's wedding before Barry prepared to save his mother. Barry said his goodbye's to his friends and foster family. Barry was then told he had 1:52 seconds otherwise a singularity would form. Eobard told Barry he holds both of their futures and then told him to run.

   As Barry ran, he saw the past, present, and future before traveling back to the night his mother was murdered. When Barry arrived to the night, Barry looked on as his future self battled Eobard. His future self then signaled him to stay back and Barry looked away as his future self rescued his younger self and Eobard murdered his mother. When Eobard had left, he went and told his mother that he and his father turned out to be ok. His mother looked at him, proud of her son, and Barry tells her goodbye, before she dies in front of him, her last words being "Goodbye, Barry".

   Barry returned and broke Eobard's time machine. Eobard asked why he didn't save his mother and have everything he had wanted and Barry told Eobard he already has. Barry and Eobard battled though Eobard quickly has the upper hand. When Eobard told he was going to kill as his friends and family, Eddie shot himself and Eobard fell back. Cisco quickly realized that Eobard was being erased from existence and before Eobard vanished, Eobard told Barry he controlled his life all his life and wondered how he would go on without him. A singularity formed in the particle accelerator and the team rushed out. As they watched the singularity eat Central City, Barry told the team he had to try and stop it, even with little chance of success. Barry ran through Central City and jumped towards the singularity.
   As he stabilized the singularity, Firestorm flew toward the singularity and Barry watched as the two separate, causing the singularity to close. As Martin Stein plummeted to the ground, Barry caught him. When Caitlin arrived at their location and learned Ronnie didn't make it, Barry hugged Caitlin and looked toward the sky. For the next six months, Barry lived in solitude, blaming Eddie and Ronnie's deaths on himself.

   Barry investigated the crime scene involving the death of
   Al Rothstein
   . Barry identified that Rothstein was strangled by someone large, though assured Joe that it wasn't Grodd. That night, Barry cleaned up Jitters from the destruction caused by the singularity. Iris arrived and joked Barry should be a contractor, as she noticed night after night, buildings had been rebuilt. Barry told Iris he wasn't going to his rally, though Iris told him he should just go as the citizens of Central City deserve to see the man who saved the city. Barry then told Iris that he wasn't the man who saved the city. After Iris left, Barry remembered it was Firestorm who closed the singularity, causing the death of Ronnie Raymond. The following day during his rally, Barry decided to show and accept the key to the city, much to the cities joy. As the key was handed over,
   Atom-Smasher
   threw a grill toward the mayor, though Barry got the mayor away in time. After Atom-Smasher grew, the Flash picked up and threw two propane tanks for Joe to shoot. After the tanks exploded, Atom-Smasher shrank and his mask unfolded. Barry and Joe noticed that he resembled Al Rothstein and Atom-Smasher fled.

Barry told his team he didn't want them there, though he was told by Joe that he needed his friends. After Atom-Smasher was tracker, Barry ran out with his Flash suit, leaving the communication system behind. After landing a few hits on Atom-Smasher, the latter grew and strangled Barry with ease. After Cisco caused a distraction setting off the alarms, Barry managed to escape and run back to S.T.A.R. Labs, though he passed on soon after. When he woke up, Joe told Barry that he can't blame himself on the death of Eddie and Ronnie and that it was on the entire team. Barry then went to Caitlin to apologize for not saving Ronnie, though Caitlin told Barry it was her fault as at one point, Ronnie asked her to get away from Central City, though she refused. Barry and Caitlin then watched Eobard's last will, where he confessed to murdering Nora.

   Barry and Caitlin return to S.T.A.R. Labs and the former told the team he realized that the only way to stop Atom-Smasher was as a team. Barry attracted Atom-Smasher with a Flash signal. Barry had Atom-Smasher chase him to a local plant, where the former trapped the latter in an enclosed room, forcing Atom-Smasher to absorb more radiation than he could. Barry asked Atom-Smasher why he wanted to kill him and Atom-Smasher told Barry a man named

    Jay Garrick

   Barry was told by Jay that when the singularity formed, it created a breach between both their worlds. Barry was then told by Jay that he was the Flash of his world. Jay told the team that he lost his powers and Barry quickly asked Jay how he lost them. Barry then told the team to do tests on Jay, warning the latter if he could have more enemies if they learn what he said was false.

  <p key="26bbe43b-534c-4036-897e-5ea1b79abab3">
   Barry later discussed with the team that nothing Jay said added up. Martin Stein then presented the team with the multiverse theory, telling them they need to find the breach and close it. Barry was later told by Caitlin that she ran a lie detector test while testing Jay and he passed it. Barry still reluctant to believe Jay, told Caitlin to continue running tests. Barry locked "Jay" in the meta-human prison and was told by the latter that he only wants to help, not harm. Barry was then told by Cisco about a fire and Barry ran off to extinguish it. Soon after he extinguished the fire, he was attacked by
   Eddie Slick
   . Barry went to tackle Eddie but Slick got away with his powers. The following day, Barry returned the scene as part of his job. Barry deduced that the fire was from an arsonist and was then greeted by
   Patty Spivot
   , who claimed to be a big fan of his due to his forensic reports.
   Patty
   told Barry she'd been trying to crack Joe's "no-code" and asked for any advice as she knew Barry grew up with Joe as his father. Barry told that it was unfortunate as he'd been trying to pick that since he was 11. Later, Barry told Patty he would try to put in a good word for her.

  <p key="6c1abcf3-bbb5-4be7-a102-2162afda451e">
   Joe told Barry that the Eddie Slick they have in custody is proven innocent. Joe asked if it was possible if the Slick that started the fire was from Earth-2. Despite evidence piecing together, Barry told the team he still refused to trust Jay. When Cisco said Jay was right about Zoom, Barry reminded Cisco that they don't even know anything about Zoom. After Barry told the team they need to be extra careful, Iris pulled him aside. Iris told Barry she knew he's only being extra-cautious was because of Eobard Thawne. Iris reminded Barry that not everyone is the same and he only was able to beat him because he trusted in others. After Eddie Slick took Patty Spivot hostage, Barry looked to Jay for help. Jay told the only way he could stop Slick was by hurling lightning at him, as lightning and sand creates glass.

   For an hour, Barry ran in circles and hurled lightning at a dummy, with Jay continuously telling him to go slower so he could direct the lightning accurately. Cisco and Martin Stein then reported the two on Slick's whereabouts. Barry then told Jay that they could distract Slick, with Jay, as Slick is unaware Jay lost his powers. The team return Jay Garrick's helmet and the two Flash's join hands before leaving to rescue Patty. While Jay distracted Slick, Barry saved Patty from a concussion bomb. When Slick grabbed "Jay" by the throat, Barry ran in circles around Slick and successfully hurled lightning toward Slick, turning him into glass and shattering. Later, Barry apologized to Jay for not trusting him because of a former mentor. Later, Martin Stein told the team that the most significant breach was in S.T.A.R. Labs but shortly after, Martin collapsed.

At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry and the team investigated the wormhole in the basement. Barry was told that they've tried sending objects in but they've all jumped back. Barry told the team Zoom may have been able to cross worlds due to him being a speedster and Barry may attempt to cross the breach. Unfortunately, Barry bounced back like the objects. The team deduced there's a hallway between the portals which continuously moves, therefore they need to create a "

Barry ran into Patty and they briefly conversed. Lisa Snart then bumped into the team, asking Cisco for the Flash's help as her brother was kidnapped. At S.T.A.R.

When Barry arrived, he found Snart, though he seemed fine. When Barry told Snart that his sister thinks he's kidnapped, Snart froze him. Barry was then introduced to Snart's father, as the two left.

Barry approached Leonard at a bar and asked why he was working with a man he despised. Barry was told things were complicated but Barry asked what was wrong so he could help. Barry told Snart that he may have a code of honor now but his father doesn't, leaving no choice but to stop the two. Snart reminded Barry that he could still reveal his secret and left Barry to pay for his bill. Later, Barry was told by Joe that lied about his wife as she never died. Barry assured Joe that it was for the best as Iris may have gone down the wrong path with
   Francine West

Patty asked if it could've been by a meta-human but Barry told her it wasn't. Barry then quickly discovered that Leonard is only working for his father as Lewis had planted thermite in Lisa. Barry contacted the team, who discover Lisa was indeed injected with thermite.

Barry met with Leonard and told him of his plan. When their father arrived, Barry introduced himself as "Sam" and volunteered to join the team. To prove himself, Barry told Lewis that he helped his son steal the Khandaq Dynasty Diamond the previous year. Barry, Lewis, and Leonard arrive for a heist. When their ID's were failing, Barry told the security guards they should let them go before the managers start making complaints about the clogged toilets. When they arrived at the twenty-seventh floor, they find two security guards and Barry ran to subdue them as Leonard and Lewis argued. After Barry hacked into the security lock, Lewis fired a bullet at Barry, though Barry caught the bullet and faked being shot. Before Lewis and Leonard could get away, Barry intervened. Lewis told Leonard to fire his cold gun at him or Lisa dies. Barry told Lewis that the bomb was extracted by Lisa and Barry was then shocked when Leonard killed his father. As Leonard looked over his father, Barry took Leonard's cold gun, leaving him to be arrested. Barry payed a visit to Leonard at Iron Heights, telling him that he has good inside of him. As Barry left Iron Heights, he was told by Joe that the latter took his advice on told Iris of Francine. At Jitters, Barry ran into Patty yet again and was given her number. At S.T.A.R.

Barry was later told by Joe that he was aware of his feelings for Patty. Barry told Joe that she's great but not Iris. After Henry Hewitt went on a rampage, the team found his police record. After Jax accepted his destiny as Firestorm, Barry, Stein and Jax left to face off Henry Hewitt. They managed to evade his attacks until he became unstable and blew his fuse. Barry and Firestorm then brought Hewitt to the pipeline. The following day, the team said their goodbyes to Stein and Jax as the two left for Pittsburgh. Later that night, Barry ran off and watched Patty from a distance. When he was caught off guard, the man-shark grabbed him and told him Zoom wanted him dead. As Patty walked out, she shot the man-shark several times and the man-shark dropped Barry. The man-shark was suddenly shot by a hooded man. Barry chased after the man, who unveiled his hood and Barry was shocked seeing the face of Harrison Wells.

After crashing into Caitlin and multiple objects, Jay and Caitlin told Barry to stay behind as they volunteered to look after Linda. Later, Barry went on with his date with Patty, wearing sunglasses with built in cameras for Cisco to guide him. Though he went on with the date smoothly, Patty eventually told Barry she knew he was blind. Barry told Patty that he had his pupils dilated prior and didn't want to cancel. After the date, the two kiss and Barry regained his sight, complimenting Patty's dress. The two were then called to report to Central City Picture News after Eric Larkin was killed by Dr. Light. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Jay apologized to Barry as he never thought Dr. Light would ever kill.

   After Wells argued with Jay, the two fought, though Barry stopped the two. After Barry told Wells he had retrieved Dr. Light's mask, Wells revealed to the team Cisco is indeed a meta-human, using his
   Next gen watch
   to prove so. Barry asked why Cisco never told them and Cisco told the team he was going to eventually. After failed attempts at using his powers to locate Dr. Light, Wells forced it on Cisco. Cisco told Barry Dr. Light was trying to leave town at the South Plaza Train Station. Barry left and confronted Dr. Light once more. After evacuating the train station, he asked how he is supposed to stop Dr. Light. Wells told him to confused Dr. Light by creating speed mirages. Barry told Wells he isn't able to but was told if he was able to travel through time, he should have no problem creating the after images.

   Barry went on and created speed mirages but Dr. Light sent a blast of light around her, knocking Barry away. Barry told him he couldn't do it but Jay told him he could. Barry went on to create the after images once more and knocked Dr. Light out. After locking Dr. Light up in the pipeline, Barry told them they should listen to Wells and use Linda as bait. A frustrated Jay told them once more they can't trust Wells as he has as many secrets as the one they knew. At Jitters, after Caitlin suggested Cisco should have a nickname, Barry suggested the name "Vibe".

   Barry asked Dr. Light for help to stop Zoom, though Light urged him not to, though she eventually agreed. Barry told the team of the trap while Harrison Wells told them he developed a serum that could dampen Zoom's speed. Barry and Joe were then called to the CCPD precinct. At the CCPD, Barry was told by Patty that Joe shut her down on a case and asked if it was because of their kiss, though Barry told her he never told him. After Dr. Light escaped, Barry rushed over to S.T.A.R. Labs but was too late. In fear of Dr. Light going after Earth-1 Linda again, Barry had Iris take Linda into her home. Barry and Joe then had an argument that they shouldn't go after Zoom just yet.
  </p>
  <p key="cd0352b4-7be9-49e9-ba27-3b59302ae90f">
   Barry reminded Joe that he always said it's good to play offense rather than defense at times but Joe told him that was for football tryouts. At Iris' house, Barry suggested they use Linda to lure Zoom, though realizing what he was saying was wrong, Iris told him it was a good idea. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry greeted Linda. The S.T.A.R. Labs team took Linda on a practice run. After a few attempts, Linda eventually succeeded. When he went to hi-five Linda, the latter accidentally fired a blast of light to the former, though he managed to evade it.
  </p>
  <p key="15bd7d2c-d808-40a1-85b8-4a183ccfccb6">
   Later, Joe told Barry that Linda wasn't ready but Barry told him otherwise. Later that night, the Flash went to visit Linda. When Linda said she wasn't ready, the Flash told her she's one of the strongest woman he knew. When she asked what he based that on, he revealed his identity. The following day, Barry was asked by Patty if he could go out for dinner but Barry told her he had something else to take care of that night. At night, Barry and Linda faked a battle where the latter came victorious, though Zoom never showed. Later when Zoom eventually arrived and kidnapped Linda, Barry ran over. Zoom told him that he isn't the only one who fished with bait and proceeded to drop Linda off the roof of S.T.A.R. Labs. Barry ran down and slowed her fall down and caught her.

  <p key="ceb24b92-cdcd-4814-a90c-498d2c39e63a">
   Barry then ran around S.T.A.R. Labs in circles and hurled lightning at Zoom, though the latter caught the lightning and hurled it back at him. Barry then made an attempt a free fall fight for equal velocity though Zoom still came on top. Zoom proceeded to beat Barry and broke his spine. When Wells tried shooting Zoom with the speed dampening serum, Zoom caught it and used it against Barry. Zoom then dragged Barry to Central City Picture News and the CCPD, announcing their hero had been defeated. Barry was dragged back to S.T.A.R. Labs where Zoom shoved his claw like hands into Barry's abdomen, rendering Barry unconscious. When Barry woke up, he was told Linda left for Coast City. Barry then told the team he couldn't feel his legs.

   Barry began walking around with a cane. At one point, he made an attempt to walk without it but to no success. Barry asked how much longer until he should be recovered and Caitlin told him he was almost completely healed. When Wells told the team he was returning to his earth, Caitlin tried to stop him but Barry told her to let him be. When Cisco had a reminder of his date, Barry teased him. Barry then had a call from Patty, who offered to make him chicken soup for his "sickness". Barry went to test his speed on the treadmill. When he tried to push himself, he had flashbacks of being defeated by Zoom and soon collapsed. When Joe asked what was up, Barry told Joe that he couldn't get over being destroyed by Zoom. Barry then told Joe he felt as if the city no longer see's him as the man strong enough to protect them.
  </p>
  <p key="53593207-559a-4d25-b604-377318238b1f">
   Later, Joe alerted Barry and Cisco that Grodd had returned. The three chased after Caitlin but were too late. Barry felt guilty he couldn't do anything about it but Joe told him there was nothing he could do to help Caitlin. Later, when Barry ran on the treadmill again, he was greeted by his father, who was called by Iris. Barry caught up with his father and was told that it's good to slow down to get back where he wanted to be. They were then interrupted by Cisco, who had found where Grodd was hiding.

  <p key="7bcf87b1-37d6-467c-819c-d0305a845f40">
   When Cisco told Barry he had a plan, Wells revealed himself in Eobard's suit and Barry tackled him. Cisco quickly rushed over and reminded Barry that was a different person and Barry quickly apologized. Barry introduced Wells to his father and told him he would explain "Earth-2" to him later. While Cisco and Wells went looking for Caitlin, Barry was told by Henry he saw what happened against Zoom. He told him that though the city may not believe in him, he would get through it as he had himself when he was framed for Nora's murder.
  </p>
  <p key="1e6a862d-09a0-4b51-873c-3ae916b16b4b">
   Barry was told that he needed to accept it and believe in himself to get through anything. Barry was also told that him believing his innocence when he was just a kid gave him all the hope he needed. When Wells and Caitlin returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, Wells suggested that they should send Grodd through a breach which would bring him the closest to home he could be. The team had Caitlin lure Grodd and as soon as Grodd caught her attention, Barry got her out of the way.
  </p>
  <p key="3e7c54ad-6d9d-41ac-8ab5-6e7c3816895c">
   Barry told Grodd that if he wanted Caitlin, he would have to catch him first and Barry ran toward the area of the breach. When Grodd caught up, Barry once again had flashbacks of being defeated by Zoom and was knocked down by Grodd. Barry was pinned down by Grodd with a single foot and was asked where Caitlin was. Caitlin revealed herself and told him they now understand what he wanted. Grodd released his foot off Barry and the team turned the speed cannon on, opening the breach and Barry took Caitlin to safety. When Grodd resisted to go through, Barry ran around the city and "super sonic" punched him into the breach. At S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry asked if Cisco could reverse engineer the Eobard's Reverse-Flash ring so he wouldn't need to carry a bag around, in which Wells said he could help.

   At Joe's house, Barry, Joe, and Iris showed Henry photos of Barry growing up with them. When Joe told Barry Patty wasn't buying his "sick" story, Henry asked if Patty was his girlfriend. Barry told him that he would tell him about her on the way to the bus station. At the CCPD, Barry explained he was keeping secrets was because his father was in town and was afraid that Patty wouldn't have a good image of him, despite his conviction being overturned. Barry was told by Patty that she isn't that kind of person and told her he should've given her more credit but Patty told him he should've given himself more credit. Barry and Patty then share a kiss.

   Determined to defeat Zoom, Barry continued to hone his speed. However he, quickly realized that he was not getting any faster, which Wells confirmed by pointing out that there were a number of reasons Zoom was more faster and stronger than Barry. Barry however concluded that they would just need to figure it out fast. He then went off to meet Patty. The next day Barry told Joe and Patty that a recent murder at the docks was committed by one man with the only evidence found being traces of a crystal that broke off the killers knives. Later at Jitters Cisco and Kendra were attacked by the same man. Barry quickly came to their aid and saved Cisco when the man threw a knife at him, which Barry stopped. This resulted in a grateful Cisco accidentally revealing Barry's identity to Kendra, much to Barry irritation.

   Later, at S.T.A.R.

Knowing that the police could not protect Kendra, Barry decided to got to Oliver and his team for help in Star City. Barry proceeded to rescue Oliver, Thea, and Diggle from

  <p key="bd9788f2-1df1-4fbe-853b-53aa4ea314bd">
   When Thea suggested a description of the mysterious man, Barry used his abilities to draw a sketch of the man. Felicity proceeded to use face recognition software to find a match. When she did she discovered that the only known photo taken of the man was from 1975 meaning that the man should at least be in his 80's. Oliver proceeded to question Kendra more. When his questioning started to get harsh Barry stepped in, only for Oliver to point out that by asking them to help protect Kendra, and by bringing her to Star City, Barry put all of them in possible danger. Felicity proceeded to calm him down and suggested they all go back to their home to relax and catch up.
  </p>
  <p key="e3534e77-3814-4b6e-9002-3d78d4ab5838">
   At Oliver's loft, Barry and Felicity proceeded to catch up and tell each other about what changes had happened recently in their lives. Barry then proceeded to go to Oliver and apologize only for Oliver himself to apologize and tells him that he was glad Barry came to them for help as it showed real maturity, something Oliver claimed he lacked. Soon after Oliver made a toast about how great it was to see everyone again. Later Barry went to Cisco to reassure him that they would keep Kendra safe. Cisco proceeded to tell him that when he kissed Kendra he got a "vibe" of seeing her with wings like a bird with a suit to match.
  </p>
  <p key="84f898d6-df9c-48ad-b59c-a4988fef2ff9">
   When Barry asked him why he didn't share this information sooner, Cisco told him it was because he thought it was unrelated until now and asked Barry not to tell her about his powers. Not wanting to risk damaging their relationship, Barry agreed to not say anything. Suddenly the man broke through the window of the loft. Barry quickly fetched Oliver's bow and arrows but the attacker began throwing knives at everyone, forcing Oliver to engage him while Barry protected everyone.

   Eventually Oliver managed to shoot two arrows into the man's shoulders but Thea impulsively shot the man in the chest and he fell off the balcony. To their surprise, however, the man was nowhere to be found. Back at the Foundry the group tried to find out more about the mysterious man, until Barry suggested they use Cisco's powers. Cisco proceeded to tell Kendra about his abilities and the vision he got of her. Suddenly

   After working together they managed to subdue Hawkman and brought him back to the foundry where they questioned him, but he was only interested in Kendra who he also addressed as Chay-Ara. Upon being asked the man identified himself as Carter Hall but revealed that he was really the Egyptian Prince
   Khufu
   , and he and Chay-Ara were lovers who have reincarnated over the centuries after their deaths to find each other in each life. Carter also revealed that Savage has, for centuries, hunted down both Kendra and himself and has killed them 206 times, as their life-force is tethered to his, and every time he kills them, he becomes stronger with his immortality and healing reinforced. Barry was confident they could kill Vandal but Malcolm arrived again to inform them Savage has left and is now searching for the Staff of Horus, which will make him near impossible to defeat. Carter suggested that he be allowed to show Kendra how to activate her powers and memories.

   Going to the top of a building Carter suggested Kendra jump off to unlock her potential. When she began to hesitate Carter pushed her only for Barry to save her. When he suggested she try again, Barry and Cisco refused. Oliver then pulled Barry aside and asked why he was acting the way he was, with Barry admitting that he felt the rules of how they stop evil keeps changing and how even with powers he still feels powerless. Oliver told Barry however that he had already done enough and after making a joke about Kendra giving him a "lift" back to Central City, they realized that's where the staff was located after remembering Kendra felt drawn to Central City, and came to the conclusion that both her and Carter are attracted to the items that destroy them, or are from their past. Felicity located the staff at a church in Central City. Oliver and Barry raced towards Central City to try and stop Savage, only for him to beat them to it. Oliver and Barry proceeded to try and take the staff away from Savage only for him to overpower them with the staffs power. Savage proceeded to blow the church up using the staff with Barry racing both him and Oliver to safety. Doubting Savage blew himself up the two considered the current situation a tie.

Savage demanded Kendra and Carter, or Central and Star City would be annihilated. As Cisco developed gloves to take the Staff of Horus from Savage to kill him, Barry and Oliver go and free Kendra and Carter before Savage kills them. Kendra's powers don't work, leading to her and Carter's death, making Savage near impossible to hurt. Barry uses the Staff against him to little effect along with Oliver. Oliver tells Barry to run, as he's fast enough, before Savage takes the staff and wipes out Central City with a magical blast, but not before Barry runs through a wormhole to allow him to re-live the last day. With encouragement from Oliver, Barry helps fix what went wrong before, allowing him and Green Arrow to vaporize Savage into ash with the Staff, destroying the weapon itself, and ending Savage for a time.

   While trying to find a way to defeat Zoom, a meta-human named
   Russell Glosson
   appears. Barry tries to stop him from stealing Vandervoort diamonds at the CCPD but Glosson gets away. Believing where he would appear next, Barry and the team go the Central City Museum to stop him. He invites Patty to come with him and when Glosson shows up Barry tries to stop him but he drops a chandelier on top of Patty which causes to push her and get hit instead. He later visits her at her apartment who was upset at him believing he left her and after a small argument Barry leaves. He later discovers Glosson kidnaps Patty and goes after them. After an initial struggle Flash finally defeats him and saves Patty. While Flash was on patrol Cisco informed him of a runaway chemical truck but the Flash was unable to stop it as someone rigged it, and was set to collide with a building and destroy an entire city block. Fortunately the Flash found a spanner and literally unbolted all the tires, causing the truck to stop. However, the Flash was soon informed by Cisco that Turtle was dead and sped back to S.T.A.R. Labs, unaware he was being watched. At S.T.A.R. Labs Caitlin examined Turtle and deduced the cause of death was severe brain trauma and Jay noted it occurred the same night he was captured. Jay was quick to blame Harry but he denied any involvement as Barry went back to the precinct to follow up on the runaway truck case. While there however he was very shut off with Patty in regards to her leaving which she couldn't understand, but Barry simply stated that everyone he loves leaves eventually.

   Later Flash responded to a break in at Mercury Labs but was horrified to see the trespasser was a still alive the Reverse-Flash, though the Reverse-Flash was surprised to hear Barry call him by his real name and didn't seem to be aware of his death. Instead the Reverse-Flash simply told the Flash that he knew what time period he was from and that soon he would die, and the Reverse-Flash knocked him out and abducted Tina McGee. At S.T.A.R. Labs Harry surmised that Eobard is still alive because this is a younger version who hasn't yet traveled back in time to kill Nora, and travelling through the Speed Force protected him from timeline changes thus protecting him from Eddie's death thus; leaving a timeline remnant of the Eobard who would eventually go back in time and kill Nora. While the team worked on finding Eobard, Barry talked to Caitlin about Tina's abduction but she revealed that Jay was dying of an illness caused by Zoom taking his speed, but believed the way to cure him was to replace his dying cells with healthy ones but there was only one way to achieve this; his
   Earth-1 doppelgänger
   .

  <p key="05fe5139-a66a-441a-bcbc-196fd686ad65">
   At the police station Patty asked Barry to look over the evidence from the truck incident which he agreed to but was distant with her, which Patty didn't understand why he was doing so but he simply said that everyone he loves leaves him eventually. Much later Patty, after looking over old case files and after learning of Barry and Joe's connection to S.T.A.R. Labs, learned Barry was the Flash and confronted him about it. Barry played dumb but Patty desperately told him he didn't need to lie to her anymore, understanding why he didn't tell her, but begs him to be honest now and she'll stay. However, Barry, not wanting another person for Zoom to target or stand in the way of her own future, refused to admit he was the Flash causing Patty to walk away in tears.
  </p>
  <p key="ed9f1691-5e94-449e-bcaf-ae029f84d26e">
   Later when Cisco was harnessing his powers to find Zoom he saw a vision of Eobard murdering Tina and taking off back to the future, but Harry was unable to find any trace of a tachyon device being used. However, when Cisco said he saw a clock with the time 9:52pm Harry revealed it was currently 6:00pm, revealing that he can see the future and the team began searching for Tina. With a mere few minutes left almost 3 hours later Cisco finally found Eobard and Flash spend in after him, stopping him from killing Tina and destroying the tachyon machine. However, the Reverse-Flash simply said he'd find another way back to his time and challenged him to a race and both the Flash and the Reverse-Flash sped around the city, but the Reverse-Flash was faster. However, the Flash this time managed to intercept his paths and dragged him into a warehouse where he proceeded to brutally beat the Reverse-Flash out of vengeance, ignoring Joe's protests not to but eventually listened and locked him in the pipeline.
  </p>
  <p key="d9659baf-9c8a-47b2-a175-bd4e38914e9a">
   At S.T.A.R. Labs Barry decided to talk to him to get some answers but Harry immediately protested as Eobard would learn more about him and the more he would alter the timeline, but Barry argued that Eobard killed his mother but Harry reminded him that this Eobard hasn't done that yet and doesn't know he's the Flash and he needs to keep it that way. Joe argued however that Harry already stated that Nora was going to die no matter what but Harry elaborated that Nora's death isn't set in stone, but altering her death will cause changes which no one can predict. Against Harry's advice Barry confronted Eobard anyway, remaining in the shadows so Eobard didn't see his face and asked Eobard why he despised him so much.
  </p>
  <p key="af12c649-530d-4cbe-ab9b-8f29ca48945a">
   Eobard explained that once he was obsessed with the Flash so much he wanted to be the Flash and spent years learning how he came to be, and replicated the reaction that gave Barry his powers. Unfortunately after travelling through time he learned that he was never going to be the Flash but was destined to be his greatest enemy. Following this he grew bitter with resentment towards the Flash, believing himself to be superior he dedicated his life towards killing his opposite as the "Reverse-Flash". However, Barry was disgusted to learn that Eobard murdered his mother, accidentally informing Eobard that he murders his mother in his future, because he couldn't be him but Eobard angrily claimed to have become better than him, that he is the one thing Barry will never stop.
  </p>
  <p key="dfdbd3a9-a3fa-40f6-8ad7-51029ae96c0f">
   However, their argument was interrupted when Caitlin informed him that Cisco had begun seizing uncontrollably, and despite getting him stable Cisco physically began to fade out of existence. As everyone was stunned and clueless Harry realized that Eobard's capture ruptured the timeline and Cisco is being affected by the effects, and the only way to save him is to send Eobard back to the future. Barry however protested to sending away his archenemy enemy but Joe supported Harry and begged Barry to agree. Barry reluctantly listened but reminded them he destroyed the tachyon device but Harry told them that he and Eobard running around the inner ring of the accelerator in unison, will provide enough the speedsters with enough momentum to break the time barrier and allow Eobard to go home.
  </p>
  <p key="32dfd7ee-e9e0-48a6-933e-96375b7f7125">
   In the pipeline Eobard was released as Harry talked to Flash, reminding him that this was Eobard's origins story and there is nothing that can be done to stop it but now he can send him home and move on. However, the Flash argued that no matter how far he sends him he'll always be a part of his life. As the Flash and Reverse-Flash stood side-by-side at the entrance into the pipeline the Reverse-Flash vowed they'd meet again, and the Flash agreed but promised that every time he'll be ready for him and both sped off. After gaining enough momentum the two opened a portal into the future and the Flash hurled the Reverse-Flash into the portal and returned the Reverse-Flash to the future, and Cisco's life was saved. Shortly afterward Patty called Barry telling him there is a man with a gun on the train she's taking out of town but as the Flash arrived he found no one, except Patty claiming it to be a false alarm. Knowing she knew his secret and was leaving Barry finally stopped speaking with his altered voice and bid Patty farewell as she left for Midway City.

Labs, though Wells secretly implants a device in Barry's suit's emblem to siphon his speed, hoping to exchange it to Zoom for his daughter's life. During a confrontation with a vengeful

   Barry lamented on how he failed to stop Iris from getting hurt, causing Harry to confess his involvement in slowing his speed. Barry learns from a guilt-ridden Harry that his intention was to save his daughter from Zoom, and is asked to be returned to his Earth through the last remaining breach and to seal it to prevent Zoom from returning. Instead, Barry sympathizes with Harry's situation, as the team would've done the same; Barry and the others then inform Harry that they'll go to Earth-2 with him to save his daughter.

This also shocks Earth-1 Barry to see how much more geeky he is on Earth-2 but Harry distracted Earth-2 Barry while Earth-1 Barry uses a taser on him to knock him out.

   Barry calls Earth-2 Nora and talks to him about the plane tickets to Atlantis "he" gave them and afterward Barry barely held back tears, as he and Iris went to Jitterbugs (the Earth-2 CC Jitters) there Barry was shocked to see Earth-2 Joe is a singer but after his performance when Barry talked to him, he coldly reminded him his name was Joseph not "Joe" and addresses him as "Bartholomew". Barry then quickly realizes that Barry Two's relationship with Joe is not what it is on Earth-1. When Barry talks to Joseph further he coldly blames him for putting Iris' life on the line to further his own career, stating that Iris had to become a cop so they'd have enough money for his P.H.D., but Iris defended herself saying that writing for C.C.P.N. was boring and she loves being a cop. As they watched Joseph perform they were interrupted by the arrival of two metahuman criminals looking for Barry, but Barry was horrified to see they were the Earth-2 versions of

When Ronnie fires a fireball at Iris, Joseph pushes her out of the way and takes the hit. While Joseph and Iris are distracted Barry speeds Caitlin and Ronnie outside trying to reason with them but Caitlin attacks with her powers of cryokinesis, then Ronnie flies after Barry as he speeds through the city.

However, Barry angrily insists Jesse has time and Iris and Joseph need him, insisting they are his family no matter the universe. Barry accompanies Earth-2 Iris to the hospital as comforts her when Joseph passes away from his injuries and Barry and Cisco, using a weapon build to disable Killer Frost's power, choose to aid Iris as she and Lawton attempt to bring Caitlin and Ronnie in. The Flash hides in secret as Cisco, Iris and Lawton lure Caitlin and Ronnie about but is shocked to see Cisco's counterpart
   Francisco Ramon/Reverb
   who is one of Zoom's henchmen. As Cisco Two tried to tempt Cisco One into joining him Flash intervened and engaged Killer Frost, Reverb and Deathstorm all at once but was soon overpowered and knocked unconscious. The Flash was continually attacked by Reverb and Deathstorm until Zoom appeared and murdered them both for disobeying orders and kidnapped the Flash. Awakening in a cell opposite Jesse, Barry tried to assure her he'd get them out but Zoom appeared and scolded him for making promises he can't keep but promises Barry that his cell is the last place he'll ever see.

   Barry kept looking for a way out of his cell with no luck and tried to keep Jesse hopeful that Harry will find them, after she expresses doubts and believes he only cares for himself, but Zoom returns to remind them Jesse only lives so he can kill her in front of Harry. Barry then notices a man in an iron mask in another cell tapping against the window but whereas Jesse believes he's insane, Barry suspects he may be trying to tell them something. After agreeing to work together Barry and Jesse discover the "iron mask" is using a 5-by-5 tap code and begin to decode the message. The message turns out to be "J-A-Y" as in "Jay Garrick" but when Barry tells him he's alive "iron mask" repeatedly smacks his head against the wall of his cell in frustration for reasons unclear. When iron mask attempts to tell them more Zoom returns and angrily reminds him not to speak again, then phases into Barry's cell and proceeds to brutally beat him in a fit of rage. Barry then realizes the answer is to phase through the wall but is unable to find the frequency necessary to do so.

   refuses and confronts him about all they've been through to get to him, all the things he's done, impossible things, because he had to prove to himself and Iris that he could, reminding Earth-1 Barry that he is the Flash. Motivated by Earth-2 Barry's words Earth-1 Barry finally manages to phase through his cell only for Zoom to appear after Killer Frost tells them of their plan. Barry One pleads with Zoom to let everyone else go as Zoom only needs himself and Harry, and while Zoom acknowledges this, he makes no exceptions for everyone else and grabs Jesse. Before he can kill her Caitlin blasts him with her ice beams and everyone escapes except for Barry who refuses to leave without iron mask, but Harry insists there isn't enough time. Before leaving Barry promises to get iron mask which he accepts and Barry flees.

When Zoom approaches Flash manages to get Cisco and Jesse to Earth-1 but when he returns to Earth-2 Zoom is waiting with Harry hostage who insists he close the breach. However, Harry has a dart and Flash distracts Zoom long enough for Harry to stab Zoom and the Flash speeds Harry back to Earth-1 and Jay closes the last breach. However, as the team is happy to see the last breach closing Zoom reappears and stabs Jay right through the chest, and drags him back to Earth-2 leaving the team to believe him dead. After the horrific tragedy, Caitlin starts to deny Jay's death, not wanting another lover to pass away.

   Cisco then brings her upstairs. Barry then demands Wells to open up the breach again, only for Harry to tell him that he can't, as the device they used was strong enough to close and prevent any breach from opening, ever, telling them that they can't do anything now, as they are now safe. When Barry went upstairs, he talked to Cisco about how Caitlin was doing, and what this incident is going to do to her. Wells chimes in, telling them that it will be all right and not to tell anyone about their experience from Earth-2. They reluctantly agree.

Although secretly he wanted to tell about his adventures, feeling frustrated about his circumstances, wanting a distraction for him to ignore all of it. He started to act strange around his foster family, not wanting to play games with them. One day, a week later from their trip to Earth-2, two guests arrived, known to Team Flash, John Diggle and his wife. They notified the team of King Shark, believed to be dead. John notified them that he was in A.R.G.U.S. prison until recently where he escaped, intent on going after Barry. They also revealed that A.R.G.U.S. was keeping track of meta-humans, weaponizing them. John told Barry that they were going to take care of him but Barry obliged. Though Diggle insisted that A.R.G.U.S. recapture King Shark, Barry refused, as he was the last of Zoom's henchmen and was going to take care of him himself. They then worked together to try to stop King Shark. During the search, Joe called Barry, asking him to come over to help Wally with his engineering project. Though not wanting to go, due to the situation at hand, Barry accepts, much to Joe's surprise and delight. Barry then searches for King Shark, with the help of A.R.G.U.S, but in the end, they couldn't find the shark meta. Barry ran to John, telling him the results and asked him about Felicity, knowing that she was in the hospital after Darhk's attack on Christmas, Diggle says she was okay, as she is a tough woman. John then remarked that he was like Oliver, "holding the world on his shoulders". However, it was during this conversation when King Shark attacked A.R.G.U.S. then ran off.

Although his plan to simply pose as his past-self failed due to the intervention of a

    With Eobard's information, he and his S.T.A.R. Labs friends helped him build a new tachyon device.
    While testing this out, he accidentally opened a wormhole to another Earth and met

    Despite the team attempting to compromise by using a holographic recreation of the Flash to fight crime, after Zoom returned to attack Central City, Barry decided to go along with a risky plan of recreating the particle accelerator explosion on a smaller scale in the hope that it would restore his speed.
    Although this effort seemingly vaporized Barry, he was actually sent into the Speed Force itself, where his encounters with aspects of the Speed Force masquerading as Joe, his mother and himself helped him accept his mother's death and his identity as the Flash before he returned home, his powers restored and even increased.

   this timeline's version of himself in the process, and he used an abandoned building to lock up his nemesis in a specially designed cell to keep him from harming people. Barry saw that the timeline had changed, most noticeably being that his parents were alive and well. While his "past self" had lived happily with them all these years, this also left Iris never having grown close to or even really knowing Barry and Joe as an alcoholic with a strained relationship with Iris, and a new speedster vigilante as the Flash. After three months of bliss with his new life, and periodically bringing food to Eobard in secret, Barry finally worked up the nerve to ask Iris on a date, which she agreed to. Soon after, the new Flash began struggling against an evil speedster called the Rival. After narrowly saving the other Flash, Barry learned that his replacement was in fact Wally. Barry also started to lose his memories of the first timeline, which Eobard theorized wass from Barry's frequent use of his powers in a timeline where he never actually obtained them.

This also allows Barry to be fully returned to meta human investigation duties in the police department. Barry eventually confronts Shade after he attacked the park, but realized that the meta dubbed

Barry went to investigate, but realized that it was not a meteor, but rather an alien spaceship which he later found out belonged to the Dominators. Barry got Oliver and Team Arrow's help along with the Legends, and Supergirl. They used an old S.T.A.R Labs hall as a base and battled the Dominators as they tried to kill all of the meta-humans on Earth as they thought they were a threat to their kind. Once Barry told everybody about Flashpoint after Cisco unfortunately found the message future Barry sent to Rip Hunter that Jax and Stein found on the Waverider, everyone besides Oliver, Kara, Felicity, Caitlin, Jax, and Stein didn't trust Barry as a result of Cisco's dumb actions. Once the president was captured by the Dominators the team selfishly decided to go without Barry. Oliver thought this was a crazy idea and wouldn't go without Barry.

Labs and tried to kill Oliver and Barry. Oliver fought off all of the melee fighters as Barry fought off all of the super powered fighters. The two were surrounded by all of the mind controlled heroes and were saved by Wally as he used his super speed to take out all of the fighters. Barry later got Kara to chase him to the salt mine where he faced so she flew right through him and destroyed the mind control machine that whammied all of the heroes.

   Once Oliver and company returned he along with Barry, Ray, and Sara met with Agent Smith, who revealed that the Dominators knew about Flashpoint and told him that Barry was the Flash. He also told them that the Dominators would leave Earth in peace if Barry turned himself over to them. Barry decided he would give himself up to the Dominators in order to save every met human's life along with millions of human lives. The team didn't allow him to do so with Cisco finally reconciling with him and instead they all fought the Dominators. Barry and Kara raced around the world planting the device Lilly and Martin made that would put the Dominators in excrutiating pain on every Dominators on Earth. When Felicity activated the devices the Dominators were in extreme pain and once Firestorm transmutated the meta-bomb into water the Dominators retreated leaving Earth. After the heroes beat the Dominators Barry and Oliver went out for a drink talking about who would win in a fight and how the lives they live are far from normal.

Barry then phased into Savitar's suit and knocks him to the ground but Savitar says that "It's written and if you kill me you become me". Barry destroyed Savitar's armor and knocks him out. He threatened to kill his remnant but held back. His remnant charged toward him as Barry walked away but his remnant is shot by Iris and erased from existence shorty after.

   As Barry and Iris plan their wedding, a storm broke out. They figure out that someone needs to go into the speed force prison to balance it and so Barry voluntarily goes to as he felt he needs to atone for creating Flashpoint. He passed on the role of protector of Central City to Wally and told Iris to always keep running for him. Everyone watched as Barry entered the Speed Force with a manifestation of his mother and the Speed Force storm stopped.

   would work. After Jesse and Jay came back, Jay was shocked of Barry's trick which Jay never got to do. Barry told Jay Harry's idea, which Jay strongly discouraged on the basis that every speedster could lose his speed and the Speed Force is a part of the multiverse.

   After everything failed, Barry got desperate and grabbed Iris to say goodbye and apologize for his failure. He called her his lightning rod, which gave Iris the idea to take the device with Barry's DNA out of the Speed Force. After Iris explained Barry how he was released from the Speed Force, Barry ran fast to open a portal to the Speed Force, grabbed the device, got out from the Speed Force to go to the bomb and throws the device at the explosion. The chasing lightning rays followed the device and negated the explosion. Then Barry fainted and Joe went to see his health. An exhausted Barry then asked Joe if they were dead; Joe told him that they weren't, assuring Barry that the lightning had stopped the nuke.

   A vigilante who apparently could strip people from his powers was the next meta-human. He was called
   Matthew Kim

   Barry, Cisco, Caitlin and Ralph were prepared to capture
   Edwin Gauss
   on an emerging portal of a pocket dimension, he fell back to his portal for he was surprised of Team Flash. After they took Gauss in for his protection against DeVoe, DeVoe and his wife then sabotaged S.T.A.R. Labs while Barry, Cisco, and Caitlin went to DeVoe's lair via Gauss' pocket dimension. Iris battled against Marlize while DeVoe headed to the Pipeline to take the powers of the remaining bus-metas. Ralph crossed paths with DeVoe, now in Gauss' body, in the Pipeline and the two battled each other. At last, Ralph managed to gain the upper hand and defeat DeVoe by using the sonic scepter. Ralph later apprehended him with Barry, Cisco, and Caitlin returning from DeVoe's lair. Barry looked at Ralph with a smile and congratulated him but DeVoe, using Kilg%re's powers removed the power-dampening cuffs, and finally took over Ralph's body. Barry, Cisco, and Caitlin tried to stop him but he was now very powerful. Before escaping, DeVoe mockingly thanked Barry for Ralph's body.

   After Ralph's demise, Barry developed PTSD that made him weak against DeVoe and other enemies. Team Flash asked
   Leo Snart
   for help in transferring Neil Borman to A.R.G.U.S. to protect him from DeVoe. As they were heading to A.R.G.U.S., they were attacked by DeVoe, who was intent on capturing Borman from them. Barry, believing that he could defeat DeVoe, used the sonic scepter to try to knock him out, but it was useless as he had Ralph's body, which only elasticized when the sonic waves passed him. DeVoe mocked Barry by saying, "Right, Rookie" in Ralph's voice, which made Barry fall to his knees. But in the middle of the battle,
   Siren-X
   , Laurel Lance of Earth-X, who was being captured by Citizen Cold before he was transported to Earth-1, interfered. Siren-X used her sonic scream to knock out both Barry and Leonard and even DeVoe. DeVoe eventually escaped while Siren-X brought Borman, Caitlin, and Joe to Central City Police Department, where she held them hostage. Barry, disappointed he failed to protect Ralph, was comforted by Leonard, who convinced Barry to accept his pain and face grief, made him better. Barry and Leonard headed to CCPD while Siren-X was seen to be forcing Borman to take off his power-dampening suit to spread radiation was interrupted right in time. Barry tried to stop Siren-X but he was struck by her sonic waves, pushing him backwards easily even Snart. When he was down, Barry again was haunted by his friend's death, while Siren-X continued to scream at Borman to make the radiation spread faster. After a lot of convincing words from Snart, Barry finally stood up and ran against Siren-X, knocking her out. Team Flash successfully transported Borman to A.R.G.U.S. with Snart going back to Earth-X with an apprehended Siren-X. Barry and Iris then headed to Sharon Finkel, where Barry opened up his feelings about Ralph's death.

  <p key="c09b3642-e952-4802-a393-987ad0d0f515">
   The team later gathered at S.T.A.R. Labs, where Caitlin goes over DeVoe's tech. He planned on using the stolen satellites to reduce the intelligence of everyone on Earth. Harry tried offering advice, but he was unable to think of an intelligent plan.

  <p key="2d9a9716-26c0-470f-8507-cc7fffcb2401">
   Caitlin then realized that they had been tackling the problem of DeVoe all wrong. She revealed that they need a metahuman that's immune to DeVoe's powers and the only one that met those standards was Amunet Black. While initially hesitant, Caitlin was able to convince the rest of Team Flash to let Amunet help out.
  </p>
  <p key="7ec121c3-7a86-4127-8e24-c7856cb273d3">
   Barry and Caitlin went to Amunet's hideout where they're greeted by Norvock. He told the pair that Amunet had not been heard from in quite some time so they're unaware of her whereabouts.
  </p>
  <p key="21503e42-e1a7-4bd7-ad55-e79612a07cdd">
   The group hatched a plan to find Amunet and they started it by finding out her real name.

   Meanwhile, Barry pulled Iris aside and told her to exercise caution when writing the article on DeVoe.

   When Joe and Caitlin arrived at a bodega that Amunet allegedly worked at they were attacked by her. Fortunately rushed in, stopping her from using her powers. Barry then revealed to her that they need her help to stop the Enlightenment. Reluctantly she agreed to help out and they took her back to S.T.A.R. Labs.
  </p>
  <p key="78c36d62-cb37-4449-acf0-e1dcfe088429">
   At S.T.A.R. Labs Amunet questioned Barry on why he was still wearing his uniform and revealed she already knew the Flash's real identity from when Barry was incarcerated at Iron Heights. Amunet told the team that in order to defeat DeVoe, she needed more of her metal shards, which were recently stolen. Barry sped off to find more shards in Amunet's storage lockers. Barry, Caitlin, and Amunet arrived at her storage location to try and find the person who took the shards. After a quick test, the group found out that t was Norvock who stole the shards and he and his cronies had left the boxing gym.
  </p>
  <p key="b5b1a25b-81e3-4537-9bef-9ecfdb7cede9">
   Barry and Iris continued to talk about Iris' article. She tried convincing Barry to let her release it to the public, but Barry is still hesitant due to the risk.
  </p>
  <p key="ba1cbe60-6aaf-4046-aeaa-85403d24cd1f">
   Eventually Amulet and Caitlin managed to deduce Norvock's location. As he was making a deal with thugs over the stolen metal in a dark alleyway, Barry sped to the location but is soon joined by Amunet, who tried killing Norvock. Barry managed to save Norvock from Amunet's shards, but Norvock then begins to attack them. Unfortunately manages to poison Barry with his venom. When Iris notices Barry's vitals going through the roof, she reminds Barry that he has to phase through the venom before it kills him which he does manage to do.
  </p>
  <p key="8c27d2ea-b0d5-4879-93d4-1d81aacd0047">
   Caitlin and Joe stop the thugs from making away with the shards and Amunet uses them to form a mask around Norvock. She nearly kills him, but instead decides to cut off the snake in his eye. With her new shards, Amunet ditches the team and leaves.

   Before leaving however, Amunet does gives Caitlin a concussive grenade made of Amunet's shards, which should help them take down Clifford DeVoe.

   The team met back up at S.T.A.R. Labs and Harry had an idea. He explained that Clifford had not launched the satellites yet because he doesn't have help from his wife.

   As the team starts to disperse, Barry told Iris to go ahead and publish her expose about the DeVoes.

   Barry, Iris, and Cisco worked on coming up with a plan on stopping DeVoe. Barry admitted that he was not fast enough yet to run into DeVoe's pocket dimension however Cisco pointed out that if they split up, they might have a better chance at stopping DeVoe. Eventually Cisco got around DeVoe' hack and the team found out that the metahuman DeVoe is after is Fallout. Knowing that Fallout was still in A.R.G.U.S. custody, Barry ran to Star City and brung back John Diggle, who accessed ARGUS files to find out somebody posing at him checked in six hours ago.

  <p key="cd2843b6-c46f-4ef4-8da9-933e4c50e3fb">
   Cisco and Caitlin would later come up with an idea on how to stop DeVoe; they had to enter Flashtime with Barry to assist him in rescuing the hostages in time and stop DeVoe. Barry tried convincing them not to join Flashtime with him, but they show the science behind their theory and he eventually with hesitation and reluctance agreed to train them on how to move about in Flashtime.
  </p>
  <p key="97a62ae9-52d6-4d90-aad5-0e1c4d907480">
   The three began training and on the first time, Cisco was unable to use his powers while in Flashtime.

   While Barry tried to train Cisco and Caitlin in Flashtime. They also began working on trying to come up with scenarios on how to save the hostages. While Cisco was able to use his powers this time Caitlin was not able to power up the cold gun. She fell out of Flashtime and knocked herself out.

  <p key="99f66397-f95c-4f39-8ec5-9a2229a18c3d">
   Barry and Cisco took Caitlin to the med bay where she woke up and assured them she was fine, but Barry not wanting to risk losing his friends told Caitlin and Cisco that he refused to keep training them.

   While trying to run through scenarios himself Cisco walked in and confronted Barry about continuing to train them.

   However, Cisco also pointed out that he was just as responsible as he freed Barry from the Speed Force which not only gave Ralph his powers, but also started the whole situation and told Barry he didn't do all that just so Barry could try to stop DeVoe all by himself. Barry admitted he couldn't do it by himself but told Cisco that everyone he tried to train ended up worse than when they when they met them. However, Cisco told Barry that Ralph himself was made a better person because of Barry and that they can stop DeVoe if they worked together which Barry agreed and decided to resume their training.

  <p key="2cfd288d-0461-42c6-a9a0-748484ff8e38">
   In the training track, Marlize set Barry into DeVoe's chair and placed a power-expanding device on Cecile's head. They explained that using Cecile's power with DeVoe's chair, Cecile simply needed to find DeVoe's brain wavelengths and the chair will transport Barry into DeVoe's consciousness.

   Barry rushed to the picnic where Clifford and Marlize had their first dance and after he arrived, he was approached by Ralph Dibny who was revealed to still be alive and also walking around in DeVoe's consciousness.

   Losing all hope Ralph tried to convince Barry to leave DeVoe's consciousness and spend whatever time he had left with his family. Barry refused to leave however and thought of another idea. Remembering that Marlize told Barry that if the good DeVoe transported through DeVoe's nexus, they'd be able to take control. Barry realized DeVoe had been keeping Ralph alive because if Ralph died, DeVoe would lose control.

   Eventually, the team decided to have Barry and Nora race around the Pipeline, with both of them using tachyon devices to get Nora back to her proper point in the timeline. As Barry and Nora raced off to open up the Speed Force, Wally rushed in and told the group they have to stop the pair from going forward in time.

  <p key="cad1c0f8-31b0-4704-b75a-879df171fd1a">
   Barry and Nora were knocked out and they soon woke up in the medical bay. Wally informed them that he met with the Legends and had Gideon analyze Nora's blood, where she found that Nora was suffering from negative-tachyons that were making her slower. They then noticed on the TV that Gridlock has committed another robbery and they realized that without their satellites which they had just destroyed, they were without eyes and ears to keep track on the criminal metas.

   In the Speed Lab of S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry and Iris had a heart to heart about having children. While they were talking, Barry came to a realization and left to talk with Nora. Nora admitted to him that in her timeline, Wells' newspaper of Barry disappearing in a Crisis came true and that shortly after Nora's birth he never reappeared. At that moment Barry realized that Nora wasn't stuck in the current timeline, rather she was choosing not to go forward in time in an effort to save her father from the Crisis and get to know him.

  <p key="e4a2c490-b209-4158-b384-38a69f4e3844">
   Iris called Barry and Nora back to inform them that they've identified Gridlock as a career criminal known as William Lang. They realize he boarded a plane at the airport in an effort to gain control over the flight and crash it.

   As predicted the engine of the plane exploded and was crashing. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Nora mentioned that she had heard of a story of Barry phasing the airplane through buildings. Barry then came up with the idea that together with Nora and Wally, they can make it happen. Nora gifted her dad a ring (similar to the one Thawne wielded) containing a brand new suit made by

   The three speedsters then sped towards the plane while Cisco got a better angle on the situation in an effort to Vibe them onto the plane. The scenario worked and Barry was able to handcuff Gridlock and stop him while Wally knocked him out. The three then began trying to phase the plane but their initial attempt failed as Nora found herself unable to do it. Barry then decided to give his daughter a pep talk recounting the same words Thawne told him early into his career as a hero and the trio were able to phase the airplane through Central City skyscrapers and land it safely in the river.

   Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Cisco gave Nora updated technology but Barry convinced the group that they should let Nora stay in the current timeline for a little longer. He however did not tell them know about the Crisis and persuaded them that they should make sure Nora's powers are functioning properly.

   Later that night, CCPD was escorting Gridlock to Iron Heights Prison when the convoy was stopped by a strange object that appeared and lodged itself in the road, started to glow and emitted red electricity before causing an explosion which disoriented the convoy and the officers. Gridlock remained chained in the transport vehicle while hearing the carnage outside as it appeared that there was a fight going on outside. After the fighting stopped, the door to the transport vehicle was opened, and an unknown assailant walked in and stood before Gridlock, he asked the assailant, "Who are you...What do you want?" and the assailant answered him with, "For all of you to die." The dagger in the assailants hand began to glow, and he walked toward Gridlock, appearing to intend to kill him.

   dagger
   . This forced Barry to fight the killer using combat but was easily defeated. Luckily, Nora had a brilliant idea. She grabbed one of the reactor in the
   Pipeline
   and ran to the woods. As she reached the woods, Nora quickly throws the reactor to Cicada but deflects it using his dagger. The reactor then ricochets to Cisco then explodes, causing all the metas to fall on their backs. After the explosion, an injured Cicada flies off while Barry and Nora looks for Cisco. Thinking that he was dead, Barry almost panicked until a breach opened, where Cisco came out. Both Barry and Cisco thanked Nora for saving him.

   At the weapons cache, Barry tried to shoot an incendiary arrow at the criminals, but accidentally shot a grappling hook arrow instead. He proceed to beat them using Oliver's fighting skills, but had a little problem with it due to his lack of combat training. One guy almost shot him, but luckily Diggle got him in time. Excited that he beat all the criminals, he almost let the driver get away. But luckily got reminded what to do by Dig, and shot exploding arrows at the truck. When it was all over, Barry realized that there is another guy sneaking up behind Dig, ready to hit him. He shouted in order to alert Dig, which was too late. Luckily, Oliver (who was dressed up as "the Flash" and got Barry's speed due to them switching lives) sped the two away. Barry then said that he's really glad to see him, as Diggle threw up (as he usually does when a speedster suddenly grabs him and speeds him somewhere).

   Barry and Oliver went to S.T.A.R. Labs together and told Team Flash the situation. However the entire team was confused and did not believe that the heroes had switched identities and decided to call a Team meeting without Barry or Oliver present. Later when seeing Iris by herself, Barry encouraged Oliver to talk to her and try to convince. Oliver however was reluctant noting to Barry that she was his wife but Barry in return pointed out that because of how reality was changed it had to be Oliver. He also suggested calling Iris his “lightning rod” which Oliver refused to say. Iris however ended up knocking Oliver unconscious by spiking his drink still while Ralph knocked Barry unconscious.

   Barry awoke up to find himself and Oliver handcuffed and locked in the pipeline. Barry then realized that if only Earth-1 people have them mixed up, they should go to Earth-38 to see if Kara can be a witness to their real identities. Agreeing on the plan the two first worked on getting out of their cell by using each other's powers and abilities. Barry was told by Oliver to dislocate his thumb in order to escape the cuffs use his freed hands to deactivate the power dampeners in the pipeline which he did. Barry then coached Oliver through phasing out of the cuffs and then phasing them out of the cell.

Barry however pleaded with his wife, and by sharing the memory of the day he moved in with her and Joe as a child and calling her his lightning rod. Iris relented and gave them the extrapolator. Arriving in a barn Barry and Ollie breach directly in front of Lois, who threatened them with a hammer. Kara sped to them and introduced Barry and Oliver to Clark her cousin and Lois his wife.

  <p key="eb90d2c7-ca93-408c-abdd-1fdbaf7516fa">
   Later Oliver went to Barry and admitted he let his anger get the best of him seeing Barry be so lighthearted and cavalier with his skills as in order to be The Green Arrow Oliver had to use all of the pain and anger of his past. Barry however told Oliver that is was the absolute opposite for him and that being the Flash means letting go of his pain and thinking about the people he's running too whether they be Iris or his friends. In that moment the two realized that Oliver is a better speedster when he is happy and Barry is a more skilled fighter when he's angered, so with Kara's encouragement (who had been listening) they decided to be more like each other to be more effective.

   Amazo was causing destruction in the streets when the four heroes came through the breach. They took turns attacking Amazo, trying to keep him from copying their powers and throwing him off balance, with Barry and Oliver adopting each other's attitudes the team seems to work quite efficiently. At first the plan seems to work and Superman slams him into the ground. However Amazo rises copies their powers and abilities and easily overpowers all of them. Team Flash considers the possibilities of what they can do and realize thanks to Sherloque they can simply turn Amazo off. Barry develops a plan and tells Oliver to bring A.M.A.Z.O. back toward them.

Back at A.R.G.U.S headquarters, Barry and Oliver explained the swapping of their lives and powers and skills to Curtis and Diggle.

   As the three heroes got ready to head to Gotham, Oliver suggested Barry remain behind, since Oliver's fame from making his identity public would make things difficult. Barry countered by reminding Oliver that if Gotham could handle the presence of Batman they could handle the Green Arrow as well. This led to them arguing about Batman, who Oliver insisted was a myth made up by the Gotham City Police Department much to Barry and Kara's shock and amusement. Kara then grabbed Barry and flew to Gotham While Oliver ran. While Kara and Barry landed on a rooftop Oliver lagged behind, continuing to struggle with his speedster abilities. They then discussed how to find the people from Cisco's vibe, and Oliver mentioned knowing a local reporter however he was not sure she would help though, as he could not remember if he slept with her. While also on the building they found The Bat Signal on the roof, though Oliver continued to believe Batman was a myth.

Oliver tried to talk them down but when that seemed to be getting them nowhere Barry acting on instinct attacked and managed to disarm one. The police arrived and recognized Barry as Oliver, and arrested everyone in the process. In jail, Kara chastised Barry and Oliver for their handling of the situation.

Introducing herself Kate Kane Bruce's cousin and the current inheritor of Wayne Enterprises. Kane told them that she wanted them to leave her city as soon as possible.

However he could not find Deegan's current address or employment so Kara decides to search the city. Thanks to information from Kate the duo learn of the location of Arkham. Outside of Arkham, Kara, Barry, and Oliver discussed how to break in when Cisco and Caitlin breached in through with Diggle to pass the message that they were contacted by an alternate Flash. Kara then came up with an idea to get them in. Kara pushed Caitlin in a wheelchair and told the administrator that she was delivering a new patient from the hospital, using Killer Frost's powers to bolster the lie.

Barry and Kara go for it, and they succeed slowing down time, and they eventually survive, thanks to Oliver, who used a cosmic arrow he received from Mar Novu on the Book of Destiny.

   Later, he tried to pour a glass of water. The pain returned, and he saw his mother, who was really the Speed Force. She came to warn him, that when he saved Ralph's life, a small amount of Ramsey's blood transferred into him, and now that blood is trying to bind Barry into Ramsey's will. Barry then found himself struggling between choosing the Speed Force or Ramsey; Ramsey trying to convince him that if he joins him, he will survive and can have the life he has always wanted, with Nora as his child with Iris; Speed Force trying to convince him not to listen to him. Barry eventually seems to reject Ramsey, claiming that his lies were so convincing. However, the Speed Force told him Ramsey wasn't lying. This causes Barry to get angry at Speed Force, since he never had any choice of becoming the Flash; it chose him, and ever since then he has been doing what the Speed Force wants. Ramsey appears again to convince him to reject the Speed Force and choose him, as the Speed Force will continue to use him and push him into his death in the Crisis. As Barry begins to accept Ramsey, the Speed Force reveals, that choosing Ramsey would save him and grant him what he wants in its twisted way, it would cause Barry to lose his soul, the very thing that Iris loves about him. Both Ramsey and the Speed Force attempt to pull him towards each other, with both claiming only he can end it.

He also provided them with the answer to stop Ramsey and cure everyone; use Allegra Garcia's ultraviolet radiation powers combined with the particle accelerator to burn out Ramsey's blood in a massive ultraviolet-blast. Iris and Cisco lets Barry and Ramsey in and they make their way to accelerator. Ramsey's blood starts circling around the pipeline, but Frost brings Allegra and encourages her to use her powers.

Barry goes to fight him in the streets, where he transforms into massive blood monster. He gains an upper hand and binds Barry, but Ramsey then sees his mother. Ramsey is shocked and stops. Barry then reveals how Ramsey was able to tap into his doubts, he did the same to him. Despite his madness he still had doubts about doing what he did, and seeing his mother now in his mind is all that doubt. Using this to his advantage, Barry speeds Ramsey and locks him up in the MAC, as it is way more powerful than the pipeline. Ramsey is then delivered to A.R.G.U.S.

Barry then says sitting in silence is not how he wants to spend the final minutes. Everyone in Team Flash start to reminisce about their lives, from when Barry became The Flash. Barry thanks Joe for being there for him, when he needed someone and Joe says he is proud of the man Barry has become. Cecile says how she considers Barry as the son she never had. Cisco reminisces the old days right after Barry became the Flash, how it was just him, Barry, Caitlin and Eobard Thawne. Caitlin tells Barry how her life fell apart after the particle accelerator exploded, but then Barry entered her life, and she found new joy in life again, and thanks Barry for saving her life. Iris claims that no matter if Barry won't survive the Crisis, he will never leave her, as the only thing more certain than the Crisis is them. The clock then hits midnight, and the team witnesses as the skies turn crimson red and lightning starts striking. The Crisis has begun.

   When Lyla returns, after she suddenly disappeared, Diggle hugs her. However, Barry, Clark and Ralph determine, that this is not Lyla, but Harbinger under the control of the Anti-Monitor. She drops the ruse and attacks the heroes, eventually managing to kill Mar Novu. He summons one last antimatter-wave, which wipes out Earth-1. Pariah realizes Mar Novu's final words about knowing what he must do, when the time comes, and he uses his powers to send all the Paragons to safety, before Anti-Monitor kills them.

When he returns with blast, Kara and Sara stop him from trying anymore, despite him being adamant. But everything changes when Oliver Queen, now as Spectre, appears before them. Oliver tells the Paragons, that since the multiverse is gone, their only hope is to travel to the Dawn of Time to recreate the universe. In order to do so, Barry needs to lead the Paragons to the Speed Force, but with his current power, he can't. Oliver can give him a power, boost, but the Paragons also agree to make a backup plan. Since Anti-Monitor was created by accident by Mar Novu, Oliver says someone has to go to Planet Maltus ten thousand years in the past to stop him from going forth with the experiment, that results in Anti-Monitor's creation. Kara volunteers to go with Lex and Ryan, while the rest travel to the Dawn of Time.

But then, the Anti-Monitor attacks and causes Barry and the remaining Paragons get trapped into the Speed Force. Barry meets Oliver, who tells him he must find the others. Barry quickly learns they are trapped in different moments in Oliver's life. Barry is at the moment, when he and Oliver first met. As he proceeds further, he finds himself in the Elseworlds and learns, how Oliver was able to save him and Kara back then. He talks with Oliver again, and Oliver claims that dying is the easy part, but the real heroes will have to keep going.

   At the Dawn of Time, the Paragons encounter the Anti-Monitor. Ryan thinks it's not possible, since he managed to convince Mar Novu not to go through with his experiment. However, Anti-Monitor claims that he only did that with one Mar Novu, as there are other Mar Novus, and one of them will always go through with his ambition, which results in his creation. Oliver appears to the Paragons again, and tells them, that they can recreate the universe here. He will light the spark, but the Paragons must fan the flame. And so, the Paragons begin fighting Anti-Monitor's Shadow Demons, while Oliver fights him. Eventually, with the help from Paragons, Oliver defeats the Anti-Monitor, with the cost of his life, and creates a new universe. Sara demands Barry takes her to Oliver, and they both claim Oliver will make it, but Oliver says he is at peace, and reiterates, what he told Barry; dying is the easy part, but the real heroes are the ones, who have to keep going.

   Jay Garrick
   kidnapped, so Flash and XS went to save Jay and Bart, but there were too many clones until Mecha-Vibe returned to help and save the speedsters. Upon returning, Barry and the team thought of a way for August to regain his memories. Barry managed to enter Heart's mind to discover that his Godspeed subconscious was waiting for him.

   Barry demanded that Heart know how to end the war, so Heart told him that if he returned his power to regain his memory, he would absorb the power of the clones to end the war, but Barry rejected his idea. As they left, Barry told everyone what Heart told him. Barry called "Nora" to ask for her help in the war and to give more power to everyone, including Iris and Bart. Flash and the speedsters faced the first wave of clones, but the clones grew stronger until Allegra arrived with Chester's machine to eliminate the clones. The team had to repair Chester's machine to destroy all the clones, but Nora suggested giving Heart the power. Barry refused because his duty was to protect his children, but Bart told him that the city does not need parents, what it needs are heroes.

   Finally, Barry agreed to give Heart the energy. Barry and Cecile watched as August returned to being Godspeed and absorbed all the clones to regain all his power. Barry dropped off his kids at S.T.A.R. Labs, as he and Iris had a plan to stop Godspeed. Barry's plan was to revive Thawne to help them. Flash started chasing Godspeed across the city, but Heart had grown more powerful. When he was going to be assassinated, Flash was saved by Thawne, who managed to be revived by "Nora". Flash and Reverse-Flash worked together using energy sabers to confront Godspeed by making a temporary truce. By defeating Heart, Barry prevented Thawne from killing him.

   When Eobard went to attack Barry for revenge, he succeeded in humiliating Thawne by showing that he had become more powerful. After Thawne escaped, Barry asked "Nora" to erase Heart's memory of his real identity and then send him to prison. Barry celebrated the victory with everyone and commented on everything that happened. Thanks to Bart's speech, Barry and Iris decided to renew their wedding vows at the West house. Barry and Iris proudly watched Bart sing at the vow renewal. He and Iris proved that their love has no limits and kiss Iris in Flashtime.

In an alley somewhere in the city, Thawne reveals he created his own reverse-Flashpoint, inspired by what Barry did after defeating Zoom in 2016. Thawne created his Flashpoint by creating multiple changes, all compounding onto each other to create a timeline where he was chosen by the Speed Force to be the Flash. He also manipulated events in 2021, including framing Barry for working with Black Hole, causing his suspension from CCPD, destroying S.T.A.R. Labs' early warning system, forcing the city to close it when they detect a radiation leak, killing Joe West and leaving Barry with no memory, and pretending to be the Flash and attacking the city, turning the city against the Flash and tricking Barry into thinking he is losing his mind.

Darhk uses the time stone to determine whether Barry is telling the truth, learning he is and all about Crisis. In trying to determine how to undo Reverse-Flashpoint, Barry determines that the speed he needs to run at to open a time portal to do so is what brings about Armageddeon.

Returning to 2021, he finds Eobard's influence to be completly reversed, restoring his place at CCPD and S.T.A.R. Labs as well as restoring Joe to life. His speed is also completely restored as in the restored timeline, he never went to Black Lightning and asked him to follow the Injustice Protocol to steal his speed.

   In the timeline where Eobard Thawne hailed from, Eobard conducted research into the Flash such as his origins and enemies he battled in his career as a hero. One was Savitar, a version of Barry, whom Eobard considered to be a much bigger "jerk" than himself as the Reverse-Flash and who he thought to have a funny "pizza face".
     This means Barry Allen in the future fought Savitar on at least one occasion between 2020-2024.

   Savitar's existence is the result of a causal loop in which he has no beginning or end but only an endless series of events that lead to his creation. Beginning in a possible timeline after Iris's death by Savitar, Barry at some point in 2020/2021 created time remnants to help stop Savitar. However, Savitar slaughters most of them but spared only one time remnant to live as this time remnant was to become Savitar at some point in the future. After his creation, the time remnant was shunned by Team Flash because he was an aberration and not the 'real Barry'. Alone and overwhelmed by his painful memories, he became desperate to end his pain eventually coming to a realization that "God" feels no pain and he eventually decided to become one himself.

Savitar killed all of the time remnants but spared his younger self, so that he would eventually become him, thus continuing the loop of his existence. To his surprise, however, the Flash was eventually able to defeat Savitar by imprisoning him inside the Speed Force, during which Savitar was stuck in a time loop in which he relived the most painful moment of his life, driving him further into insanity, thus wanting him to destroy his original self's life even further.

Julian spent years searching for the Philosopher's Stone and funded an exhibition in India in 2012 and found the container the object was sealed within. After Julian opened the container, Savitar was released and possessed Julian, killing the other members of the exhibition. While Julian tried to escape Savitar by fleeing to America, he continually possessed Julian, and his host unwillingly became the newest version of Alchemy. For the next few years, Savitar (as Alchemy) sought out followers for his cult, seeking to slay a younger, less powerful version of his original self.
    He also somehow became aware of all the meta-humans from the Flashpoint timeline which unintentionally provided him the means for his return.

   Under his Alchemy guise, Savitar began seeking out individuals who were meta-humans in Flashpoint and restored these individuals' memories and extorted them into finding him. Once they did, Savitar promised to restore their power in exchange for their loyalty. He did this to "

   " and
   Clive Yorkin
   . Savitar then sought out
   Frankie Kane
   , a teenage girl with dissociative identity disorder due to the restored Flashpoint memories, persuading Frankie to find him. Once Frankie did, Alchemy offered to restore these powers in exchange for services. While Frankie was reluctant, the alternate personality Magenta agreed and Alchemy restored these powers.

   Savitar then communicated with

    Once Clariss arrived, Alchemy was begged upon to make the visions stop, but Alchemy asked if Clariss really wanted the visions to stop, or if Edward wanted them to come true and to have speed once more. Clariss confessed wanting the speed and Alchemy promised to restore this power, in exchange for loyalty. He used the Philosopher's Stone on Clariss, and Clariss was The Rival once more.

The Rival then fought the Flash again, but the Rival was defeated by the combined power of the Flash and

   Alchemy was later confronted by Magenta, being angry that Frankie continued to resurface, as Alchemy had promised freedom from Frankie and the girl's foster father. Alchemy told Magenta that if she wanted Frankie gone, Magenta would have to show who was in control, and this led to Magenta almost destroying a hospital full of innocent people to get revenge on Frankie's foster father. However, Frankie was talked out of this by the Flash and left Central City as a result.

Wally stalled Alchemy long enough to allow the police and the Flash to storm the hideout. Alchemy and his cohorts were subsequently surrounded and shackled. Flash triumphantly stood before Alchemy and went to unmask him. However, just as the Flash was about to do so, an earthquake shook the hideout and suddenly a small blip of light began racing around the hideout, killing all of the cops and freeing Alchemy's followers. Realizing the blip of light was a speedster, the Flash attempted to pursue, but the speed was far beyond anything, and Flash was brought down instead. As Wally became trapped in a cocoon-like container, the mysterious speedster pinned the Flash to a wall, revealing itself to be clad entirely in metallic armour. As the Flash finally beheld the armored foe, Savitar responded that he was the god of speed. Savitar then produced a long curved blade from his gauntlet and prepared to finish off the Flash.

   's timely intervention by managing to shake off the cult followers, and opened fire on Savitar even though Joe couldn't actually see the speedster. The bullets, however, deflected harmlessly off Savitar's armor. Ignoring the interruption, Savitar raced out of the lair with Flash in hand and proceeded to drag, pummel and throw his opponent all across Central City like a rag-doll, by somehow using his speed to open up dimensional breaches to various locations around Central City, finally coming to a stop at the waterfront, whereupon Savitar began to savagely beat down his quarry. As the Flash lay broken and bleeding at his feet, Savitar declared the Flash to be beneath him and announced that he
(Savitar) was the Future Flash while his original self was the past Flash. Having said this, he grabbed the Flash by the throat and prepared to once again skewer the speedster with his gauntlet-blade. Before he could do so, however, the Flash was saved by Vibe and

   Later, Savitar sought out Julian while Julian was in the hospital.

   With Julian resuming the Alchemy persona, Savitar prepared once again to target the Flash. He ordered Alchemy to use a specially-designed building in Central City to refract the energies from the Philosopher's Stone and bestow powers on all the meta-humans in Central City from the Flashpoint timeline at once. Their efforts were interrupted once again by the arrival of two Flashes; Barry having joined forces with
   Jay Garrick
   . Before the two Flashes could do anything to Alchemy, Savitar appeared out of nowhere. While Alchemy dealt with Barry, Savitar squared off against Garrick. Savitar completely outmatched Jay, viciously pummeling and beating down the elder speedster all across Central City, finally coming to a stop in an alley. The metallic speedster angrily pointed out that it wasn't Garrick's fight, and unsheathed his gauntlet blade to kill the
   Earth-3
   veteran speedster. Garrick was saved, however, when Barry sealed the Philosopher's Stone back in its chest, causing Savitar to disappear into thin air.

  <p key="4c0ef743-c7a0-4be7-a9ad-da1bd0085680">
   Looking to continue the fight, Savitar chose to bide his time in order to figure out a way back. He began telepathically manipulating Cisco using
   Dante Ramon
   's likeness and memory to convince Cisco that the Philosopher's Stone could bring Dante back to life. Entranced by the Philosopher's Stone's power, Cisco opened the chest, releasing Savitar once again just as Barry arrived in Cisco's lab. Savitar then seized Barry to the S.T.A.R. Labs' speed lab, whereupon he began to mercilessly beat up the

   speedster yet again. As he did so, he was stalled by Wally's sudden arrival, but was merely seized by the throat by Savitar and thrown across the room into Barry. As the two speedsters lay defeated on the ground, Savitar unsheathed both of his wrist blades and moved to kill both speedsters. However, this was prevented at the last second when Caitlin convinced Cisco to accept Dante's death and close the chest containing the Philosopher's Stone, sealing Savitar away again.

   Fuming from his latest defeat and Alchemy's constant failures, Savitar suddenly felt Julian's consciousness connected to the Philosopher's Stone, established a psychic connection through Julian and found himself face-to-face with Team Flash. He berated the group for not bowing to him, only to be derided for his claims to be a god. Seeking to rattle Team Flash, Savitar revealed intimate knowledge of each of the group's members as well as a chilling warning about their future; one would betray them, one would die and one would suffer a fate worse than death. Barry demanded to know who Savitar really was and what he wanted, to which Savitar responded that he wanted to take back everything that the Flash had taken from him, before he would destroy his original self. Confused, Barry angrily asked why Savitar didn't follow through with his threats right away, before realizing that without the Philosopher's Stone, he literally couldn't. Enraged, Savitar revealed the reason for his vendetta; that it was in fact a future version of his original self who had trapped him "in eternity" and vowed that he would rise again. Disconcerted, Barry disconnected Julian from Savitar.

    which came to a head while the Flash and Kid Flash were out on a run, and one of Kid Flash's hallucinations actually attacked him. Desperate for answers, Team Flash opened up a line of communication to Savitar through Julian once more. Savitar sardonically greeted Barry's comrades but Barry quickly rebuffed him when Barry argued that they were essentially the same, claiming that to him, Barry was the villain of their story. He revealed yet more intimate knowledge of the team such as Cisco being as powerful as

   surviving his future rampage. Team Flash interrogated Savitar extensively about his plans and his past but got only cryptic answers and half-statements in response; Barry questioned about their feud's origin but Savitar arrogantly derided both the Reverse-Flash and Zoom, claiming that he was the Flash's ultimate foe. He did however reveal that he had taken back the Philosopher's Stone and declared that no matter what they did, they could not stop his return. As he rose to his feet, Savitar reaffirmed his intention to escape, kill Iris and destroy his original self, mockingly bringing up Barry's deceased parents. Fed up, Barry disconnected Julian from Savitar.

  <p key="1abb5bbc-1e28-47c2-8b8d-d512e65583aa">
   Satisfied that almost everything was in place, Savitar focused on getting the broken piece of the Philosopher's Stone. He telepathically linked to Wally once again by taking
   Francine West
   's form this time to torment, and pressured Wally into stealing the piece of the Philosopher's Stone. Kid Flash stole the piece from S.T.A.R. Labs and raced to an abandoned factory and manically tried to open a portal to the Speed Force, but was held back by the power of the Philosopher's Stone. Savitar mocked Kid Flash's efforts, reminding Kid Flash that he would eventually kill everyone West loved. Infuriated by Savitar's words, Kid Flash successfully opened a Speed Force portal and threw the piece of the Philosopher's Stone into the portal.

   As the Flash arrived on the scene, tendrils of white lightning seized and pulled Kid Flash into the Speed Force, while breaking its hold on Savitar, bursting out of the portal roaring in triumph. Pacing around the Flash, Savitar revealed his full escape plan and declared that saving Wally was now impossible. Enraged, the Flash charged Savitar and chased him into an alley. Though the Flash angrily promised to kill him, Savitar mocked these threats, reminding him that Barry was the hero who would never take a life, and was unworthy of the life he had been given, vowing to destroy Central City like he did in the future. This time, though Savitar remained dominant, the fight was more even-sided, with both speedsters landing solid blows on the other, culminating in the Flash seizing Savitar in a headlock, demanding he show his face. Savitar instead pivoted out of it and stabbed the Flash through the shoulder with his gauntlet-blade, shattering his clavicle. Stating his intent to kill the Flash, Savitar promised to let his
original self live long enough to watch Iris die. The Flash unexpectedly struck back by slicing off Savitar's blade with a vibrating hand. Roaring with anger, Savitar raced away.

   Savitar remained silent and out of sight for the time being, while Team Flash frantically searched for a way to rescue Wally from the Speed Force, in order to work on repairing his damaged armor. When he finished, he stepped back and observed from afar as Barry went back into the Speed Force to free Wally from Savitar's former prison. While doing so, he suddenly felt the lost piece of his armor being reactivated and homing in on him. Racing to the piece, he found himself confronted by
   Jesse Quick
   . He knew that Jesse would come for him, reprimanding Quick for claiming of not being afraid of him. Angered, Quick recklessly attacked with a lightning bolt, but Savitar inexplicably absorbed the bolt and fired right back at Quick, sending Jesse flying several feet. Savitar demanded the return of his severed gauntlet-blade and began telekinetically summoning the piece to him, which Quick clung on to and too was dragged towards him. Thinking quickly, H.R. instructed Quick to find and attack a weak spot in Savitar's armor. As Savitar seized Jesse by the neck and held before him, he declared that he had plans for the

   speedster, his arrogance blinding him to the fact that Quick was still holding his gauntlet-blade. Retorting that Quick had plans too, Quick viciously plunged the blade into Savitar's shoulder through a gap in his armor. Bellowing in agony, Savitar dropped Jesse and raced away. Realizing that Savitar could feel pain, H.R. later informed Team Flash that Savitar was not a God after all but an armoured man with super speed.

When the team managed to subdue Killer Frost anyway, Savitar sped in as Vibe was taking a blood sample and swatted Vibe away. Proclaiming that his ascension is almost complete, Savitar concluded with a reminder to Barry that before long, the Flash would fall. Having said this, Savitar picked up Killer Frost and raced away.

Declaring his relief, Savitar knelt down, removed his armor and revealed himself as none other than a future version of his nemesis with a pale and scarred face. Grinning ghoulishly at his younger self, Savitar reiterated his frequently-repeated quip, that he was the Future Flash.

   Savitar paced around his younger self with a ghoulish smile on his face as he laid everything out in the open; that he was a time remnant created by the Flash's future self in 2020/2021 whom Savitar had allowed to live before being sealed away, comparing himself to Barry's first time remnant used against Zoom. The time remnant was rejected and shunned by Barry's family and friends as a "fake", leaving him bitter and broken. Desperate to make the pain go away, the time remnant was driven insane and strove to become a god, for which he went back in time to reinvent himself as the "original speedster", creating a perpetual cause and effect
temporal loop. All that was left to complete the loop again is for Iris to die and a second element that Savitar didn't reveal. Barry threatened to kill himself, causing Savitar a brief moment of concern but was quickly undaunted, citing the Reverse-Flash's survival despite
   Eddie Thawne
   's sacrifice as an example of how such action would be futile, and declaring his ascension nearly complete. Enraged, his younger self charged Savitar and attempted to kill him, but was stopped by Savitar's self-operating armor, which engaged the Flash in a brief struggle. As the Flash punched the armor away, Savitar sped back into his armor and began charging up for a lightning attack, as his original self did the same. The two fired massive bolts of lightning at each other which caused a huge explosion, hurling the speedsters away from each other and allowing Savitar to escape.

   While preparing for his next move, Savitar was inexplicably stripped of all his memories as a result of Team Flash accidentally wiping all of Barry's memories, causing him to randomly attack Killer Frost when his enforcer tried to talk to him. He remained in seclusion for a time until Team Flash undid the damage by restoring Barry's memories and Savitar's by extension.

   Savitar remained in his hideout in an abandoned warehouse and passed the time by repairing his suit of armor. As he was doing so, Killer Frost approached him, admiring the armor and remarking on them teaming up like they used to as Barry and Caitlin, though Savitar was quick to remind his enforcer that neither of them were who they used to be. Killer Frost pressed Savitar about his motivations for killing Iris, to which Savitar reiterated that Iris had to die otherwise he would never exist. Unconvinced, Killer Frost spoke of his upbringing with Iris, citing it as possibly deterring him from ultimately killing Iris. Rising to his feet with an expression and voice full of rage and pain, Savitar coldly recounted being created as a disposable asset of his original self, nothing more than a cheap copy to be thrown away when no longer needed. He reasoned that if none of Team Flash cared about him, he shouldn't care about any of them. Disturbed, Savitar asked Killer Frost to reiterate the commitment to the cause and re-prepare herself for her own actions. Suddenly, Savitar was hit by a fresh wave of new memories in which the Flash met with
   Leonard Snart/Captain Cold
   in the past to steal a power source from

   for Tracy's weapon. When Killer Frost inquired about it, Savitar waved it off as irrelevant and decided to let them take it, declaring a speed-gun to be no match for him.
  </p>
  <p key="6ba42f6d-3132-4497-9a64-a7b1e366ea57">
   As he prepared for the final confrontation, Barry's plan was thrown off briefly when he suddenly realized that he did not know
where Iris was since his younger self had not been told either. Determined to get things back on track, Savitar disguised himself in his old Flash uniform and raced into S.T.A.R. Labs were he met Cisco, H.R. and Tracey. He told the group of obtaining the

   power source, and asked where Iris was. Without thinking, H.R. let slip that Iris has been on Earth-2, realizing his mistake too late as Savitar turned to face them, revealing his scarred face and his true identity. As the team looked on in horror, H.R. could only choke out a single word before Barry raced off to Earth-2.

   stood ready, Savitar burst out of the breach in the S.T.A.R. Labs of Earth-2 in full armor. Immediately, Kid Flash charged him and landed a number of blows against the armored speedster, before Savitar threw Kid Flash against the ceiling, caught him while falling, and brutally broke his leg with one stomp, tossing the young speedster aside. As Joe and Harry fired, Savitar silently exited his armor and appeared behind Joe, Harry and Iris. Looking into Savitar's maddened eyes, Joe attempted to reason with Savitar by apologizing for disregarding him in the future, referring to him as Barry. Unmoved, Savitar angrily stated that Barry was not his name. Iris promised to go with him and begged him not to kill the others, though Savitar claimed that he would only do so after they all watched Iris die. Joe begged Iris not to go but Barry interrupted, remarking that Iris had accepted this fate and that Joe should do the same. As Harry brandished a hidden gun, Savitar grabbed Iris and raced back to Earth-1. He then chained up Iris in his lair and made a few adjustments to his suit, until H.R. used Savitar's blade piece to find Iris, tied up. The blade flew from H.R.'s hand and fixed itself back to his suit, to which Barry saw H.R. and Iris running towards the exit, ordering Killer Frost to get Iris.

   Barry brought the individual he believed to be Iris to Infantino Street, where the Flash as well as Joe and Tracy were lying in wait. Barry challenged Flash to try and be a "hero", and dropped Iris to the ground. When he did, the Flash went and used the
   Speed Force bazooka
   on him. After avoiding a few shots, Savitar let himself be hit, making everyone believe for a moment that it was going to work. Savitar then burst free of the energy and revealed that he had the Philosopher's Stone, which was made of "calcified" Speed Force energy that shielded him from the trap, taunting Barry over having given the stone to him when they initially discarded it into the Speed Force. Savitar then grabbed Iris and told the Flash that his future self had sentenced him to an eternity of hell, so Savitar was giving him the same, proclaiming that he was finally free of the original Barry, before bringing out the spear from his armor. Barry tried to run to him and stop Savitar, but he quickly stabbed Iris through the back, before speeding away, leaving the Flash to cradle Iris's dying body in his arms,
    quickly revealed to actually be H.R. who had taken the fall.

   After stealing the Speed Force bazooka, Savitar raced and found Killer Frost preparing to finish off Vibe, and ordered Killer Frost not to as he needed Vibe for the next phase of his plan. At that moment, Savitar was hit by fresh memories of Iris alive, and in horror realized that he had been tricked and had instead killed H.R., which would in turn change the future to one in which Savitar was never created. Enraged, Savitar pointed out that Vibe's own future had now changed too.
  </p>
  <p key="c425ec3b-b0b4-4453-8bc9-27834d916e45">
   Upon returning to his lair in Mount Buccelato with Killer Frost and Vibe, Savitar ordered Vibe to convert the Speed Force bazooka into an interdimensional quantum splicer, which he would use in combination with a Speed Force portal to fragment himself throughout all of time, making it impossible for the upcoming paradox to erase him from existence, thus allowing him to exist and rule as a god in every moment of time from the Big Bang to the end of the world. All he needed was for Tracy to build the Speed Force bazooka earlier than was intended, which was why he allowed the Team Flash members to live. When Vibe refused to help him, Savitar threatened to kill Killer Frost by taunting Vibe with the revelation that Julian had developed a cure for Caitlin, leaving Vibe with no choice, and relented.
  </p>
  <p key="9a558d93-6601-420d-83fd-56b0abfe280d">
   While he waited for Vibe to finish, Savitar flashed a new memory of his younger self waiting for him in a warehouse. Realizing that this would give him the opportunity he needed, Savitar met with Barry. Barry implored Savitar to let him save him, citing a fond memory of their parents to get through to Savitar. Savitar allowed Barry to lead him back to S.T.A.R. Labs. Once there, he was confronted by Team Flash being highly reluctant to help him, especially Tracy. Barry and Iris took Savitar aside where Savitar questioned the two over what kind of life he would have if they saved him, though they could not give any definitive answers. Savitar also remembered a
   certain device
   being used on
   future nemesis
   of the Flash while touring S.T.A.R. Labs. Eventually, Savitar decided he could not endure living in a world where nobody treated him like Barry. Giving up on redemption, Savitar took the Philosopher's Stone into the basement to be set to overload. As Barry and Wally got everyone out, the Philosopher's Stone exploded and obliterated the interior of the complex, giving Savitar the chance to escape. He returned to his lair as Vibe completed the interdimensional quantum splicer, and ordered Killer Frost to kill, but Vibe was saved by Gypsy at the last second. Declaring what just happened unimportant, Savitar picked up the interdimensional quantum splicer and left to enact his master plan.

  <p key="881cb490-664e-4e69-86e7-b959da762cff">
   Knowing that the Speed Force would try to kill him because of the paradox, Savitar went to a park on Central City's outskirts with Killer Frost and the Speed Force cannon in hand. Savitar opened a Speed Force portal filled with bursts of orange lightning and explained to Killer Frost that the reason he had brought his enforcer along was because of how the Speed Force dealt with speedsters who mess with time. As Savitar expected, the Speed Force unleashed the Black Flash out of the portal. Killer Frost fired off several shots at the Black Flash but missed. As the spectral speedster raced to them and lunged at Savitar, Killer Frost fired again, hitting and shattering the Black Flash. With the Speed Force's enforcer out of the way, Savitar stood in front of the portal and ordered Killer Frost to shoot him with the interdimensional quantum splicer, where multiple versions of himself formed in a line leading into the Speed Force, appearing to work. Suddenly as the beam turned red, the clones disappeared and Savitar became whole again as the beam from the interdimensional quantum splicer instead went straight through him and into the Speed Force portal instead. As they looked on, Jay burst out of the portal and swatted Savitar away. Horrified, Savitar turned to see Team Flash's powered members, Vibe revealing that the Speed Force bazooka had been turned into a skeleton key which freed Jay from Savitar's prison.

  <p key="87b7277a-942f-477f-becc-a7cf1a3d36de">
   Seething with rage that he had been tricked, Savitar raced away with both Flashes and Kid Flash in close pursuit, while Vibe and Gypsy took on Killer Frost. Realizing he could not outrun the trio for long, Savitar first tried to block their path by chopping down a pair of trees, which failed. He then leapt high into the air and turned and fired a bolt of lightning at the three speedsters, which knocked them all down. Savitar returned to Killer Frost just in time to see Vibe standing over, victorious. Swatting Gypsy away, he seized Vibe by the throat and prepared to kill Vibe with a vibrating hand (similar to how the Reverse-Flash killed Cisco in an erased timeline and to how Zoom killed Reverb on Earth-2). At that moment, Caitlin turned on Savitar and blasted him away. Rising to his feet, Savitar reprimanded Caitlin, before bringing down Barry trying to flank Savitar. Admitting that his time was almost up, Savitar declared that he would take down Barry with him by killing Barry's foster family. As his back was turned, Barry defiantly charged Savitar and phased into the suit of armor, expelling the time remnant out of the armor. As he lay on the ground, Barry taunted Savitar. Amazed and confused, Savitar attacked without his armor, but was no match for Barry, and ended up on his knees.

   As Barry stood before Savitar with his gauntlet-blade drawn, Savitar in despair dared Barry to finish him off, believing that if Barry killed him, Savitar would still exist. It was all for naught, however; Barry, instead, spared Savitar, destroyed the suit of armor and laid out his aghast opponent with a vicious speed punch. As Barry walked back towards his friends, Savitar rose to his feet again and charged at Barry roaring with rage, determined to take him down with him one way or the other, but only to end up being shot in the back by Iris, instantly killing him. As his body lay lifeless, the paradox had caught up and completely erased Savitar from existence.
    At the same time, another version of Barry along with his
   future daughter
   watched nearby and collected a piece of Savitar's armor.

Finally, he was willing to kill a reanimated and mindless
     Tony Woodward

     Barry is a forgiving individual, as after Eobard was erased from existence, it took him months before he finally forgave the latter for murdering his mother and framing his father for his crime, he stated that no matter how much he hated Eobard, he couldn't bare hating him anymore, however, this hatred was (apparently) rekindled when Eobard's time remnant appeared, enough that Barry came close to beating him to death, Barry showed great outrage and disgust at learning that their antagonistic relationship in the future and Eobard's own hatred of Barry was because Eobard was jealous of the Flash and wanted to become better than him. After being forced to release Eobard from captivity, they both stated that they hated each other, with Barry being bitter at having Eobard murder his mother, Nora in the past to restore the timeline.

     Despite Barry's honorable ways and proclivity for pacifism in the face of deadly and often ruthless and sociopathic enemies, he does harbor some very disturbing and homicidal feelings towards some of his enemies in particular, these two being Zoom and Reverse-Flash, due to their parts in the deaths of his father and mother, respectively. After the capture of Eobard in the particle accelerator on the first occasion, Barry expressed an unhinged and blood-thirsty desire to kill him, even spitting with rage when he voiced this overwhelming need of his.
    </p>
    <p key="b3d28d82-3fb0-4d64-b2a9-73a66107e3a2">
     This is in almost direct opposition to Barry's normally restrained and merciful attitude towards his enemies, his desire to kill Hunter Zolomon may even be greater, due to how thoroughly Hunter had deceived Barry and his friends, and how Hunter tortured Barry by kidnapping his father and then stabbing him through the chest with a vibrating hand, all the while this death took place in the same room where, approximately 16 years prior, Barry's mother was murdered by Eobard. This replication of his mother's murder with his father profoundly affected Barry, and awakened a need for cold-blooded vengeance in him that he has never felt before, having had the pain of losing both parents in the same way, each to a deranged speedster, compound one another, tearing him apart emotionally.

     Once Barry realized how big a mistake he made once seeing Wally injured, he attempted to correct the time, yet was only somewhat successful. When

     Although Barry does have guilt, shame and remorse for his actions, especially if they have unintentionally hurt the individuals he cares about, simultaneously, arguably Barry's greatest fault is his guilt for actions he believes that could have been stopped; due to this, he has tried rectifying his mistakes by time travel, but has actually ended up causing even bigger problems than what he initially sought out to prevent. The most major example being the creation of

     Barry's heroic and peaceful nature hid a more complex and powerful set of emotions that he does not fully express but has always harbored on a subconscious level, while as civilian, the Flash or when pushed over the edge by enemies, Barry has been known to act on nearly fourteen years of repressed anger and emotional stress, these emotions were obvious after being exposed to
     Roy Bivolo
     , voicing unfounded contempt for others unusual in Barry's usually calm nature and respectful attitude such as snapping at Joe for imprisoning and criminalizing his father, speaking down at David Singh for his constant barking/disrespect and condescendingly voicing jealousy for the Arrow.

While initially suffering from dementia or schizophasia, he seemed to recover from this state after hearing Iris was kidnapped by a

     Due to Barry's bad experiences with Eobard Thawne and Hunter Zolomon respectively, he is not fooled at all by an individual's ability to appear kind-natured. He suspected that
     Clifford DeVoe
     was a meta-human (after the
     Council of Wells
     informed him that the latter may be the mastermind behind the bus meta-humans) despite the fact that he did not have a criminal record, his suspicions of Clifford were further amplified when he and his wife,
     Marlize
     lied to Barry's superior officer,
     David Singh
     , claiming that he was harassing Clifford (when in truth, he was only conducting the necessary investigation) even when every member of Team Flash believed that he was innocent - Barry's suspicions were proven to be correct yet again, regarding Clifford.

    <p key="720ecb35-7e09-4685-ab37-2463d3044cef">
     After Barry was framed by Clifford and Marlize for murder, he refused to reveal his identity as the Flash to the entire court (even though it could have exonerated him) this was because Barry knows full well that if his superhero identity is revealed to the public, every single one of his enemies would not only come after him, but also the individuals he cares about.
    </p>
    Barry has displayed a greater sense of responsibility when it comes to his powers, immediately shooting down Jessie's idea to use time travel to stop a nuclear bomb, remembering from experience how dangerous and damaging it can be for everyone,
     though he would later again show recklessness in maintaining the timeline in certain situations involving Eobard, presumably because his hatred for Eobard would overtake his wisdom in those moments.
     While the "Eobard" Barry interacted with was not the real Eobard, Barry did not know this at the time he yelled to "past Caitlin" not to trust him.
     Also he is more willing to be reasonable to turning down certain decisions, like accepting that Harry's idea to throw the nuclear bomb into the Speed Force was too risky to it and existence itself, as every speedster throughout time and space would lose their powers and connection to the Speed Force.

     , Savitar was shunned for being an
     aberration
     as he was not the true Barry, just someone to be disposed of. Broken and utterly alone, he wanted his pain to end but eventually came to the realization that "God" feels no pain; thus causing to aspire to be one in order to escape his torment but becoming a twisted individual as a result of this aspiration.

    <p key="a455c077-98e5-4c56-8323-59ae82397551">
     Since then, Savitar had a developed a god-complex to the point that he demands that all other bow down and worship him because of it. He was also arrogant to the point of being delusional as that the only thing that required him to become a god was to make enough people believe in him as one.
      To those who do view him as a god such as his cult of followers, Savitar seemed appreciative of them enough to aid them in time of need.
      Savitar is also egotistical, as he reveled in his status as the fastest speedster in the
     <a href="Multiverse.html" key="b9bf359d-04ec-4371-812b-18c149262dae" title="Multiverse">

     but at the same time he had a measure of insecurity related to other powerful speedsters to the point that he supposedly challenged so that they could no longer pose a threat to his power.
    </p>
    <p key="021059e9-f4a5-4234-bb10-08ce0fca198b">
     Savitar was also ruthless in his actions to the point of cruelty, as evidenced by his murders of the
     CCPD
     officers and his treatment of the members of Team Flash. Savitar's treatment as an aberration had caused him to hate them for abandoning him; which caused him to become who is now in the first place.
      Savitar, in particular, hated his original-self, going so far as to state that Barry is the villain; he initially never sought conflict with Barry but was the only one to ever truly lose anything as a result of their conflict with one another. Savitar also feels that his original-self had everything yet deserved none of it, indicating that on some level he desired his original self's life for himself.

    <p key="3f65a2a0-827f-47f7-888e-b34c2da39754">
     While not wearing his suit of armor, Savitar is seen to have a somewhat calm demeanor and even shown to make jokes, albeit in an attempt to mock his opponents; one example, was when Barry discovered his true identity, Savitar made a comment about, how it's almost like looking in a mirror and that how he had outgrown Red (his former suit's color) another such example, is when Caitlin points out that his suit really makes him look like a god, who responded with a smile and said to dress for the job you want.
    </p>
    In spite of Savitar's hatred for his original-self, he does seem to have a degree of empathy left inside him. He empathizes with Barry for all the suffering Barry has endured so far from losing his parents. Additionally, he showed empathy toward killing Iris, due to memories of love he has for her but ultimately chose to try and kill her to ensure his own existence. Additionally, Savitar firmly states he has always been with Barry from the very beginning, as he refers to himself as Barry's own worst enemy and his innermost demon; something Barry admits to being true.

      Barry can produce yellow electricity (a physical manifestation of Speed Force energy) from his body. It is commonly seen when running to boost his already immense speed to far higher levels. By tapping into the power of the Speed Force, Barry can fill his eyes with yellow electricity. This energy can be focused into his strikes, generating enough force in his strikes to greatly harm super durable foes without any harm to himself.
       Alternatively, its intensity can interfere with surrounding electronics and overwhelm electric-absorption. He can focus the energy into specific body parts to produce a strong static shock on contact with the target. Barry was later taught to harness it by directing it into his arms to repeatedly hurl lightning bolts to stun or repel enemies, and also electrify a surface. Barry can also absorb electricity from other sources, simultaneously giving him an extra boost when running or throwing lightning.
       While originally he required extensive running to build up his lightning, Barry later learned to perform this ability from a stationary position. His highest levels are about 5 billion joules (equal the power of five lightning bolts).
       He can also generate several constructs to be used in battle; such as swords and shields. After levelling up his speed, he became capable of channeling his lightning inside himself in order to disperse a heavy amount of destructive electro-blasts in the surroudings, like he did to defeat
      Xotar
      and to avoid being smashed by a car by the hands of

         This aura also seems to affect kinetic energy and inertia as Barry was able to throw off the Turtle's ability to steal kinetic energy and increase inertia on his victims.
         This also lets him grab other individuals at high speed without their momentum and kinetic energy ripping them apart and survive impact with objects moving so fast with only minor injuries.

        Jay Garrick

         After escaping from the Speed Force, gaining a greater an understanding of his power, he can use it in more passive means. By touching others, he can share his energy, letting them move, think, and heal as fast as himself, as this let Jesse recover immediately from a coma. By channeling enough energy, he can share his speed with others, letting them independently move as fast as speedsters without exhausting or affecting their own powers, until they burn through the borrowed energy. Barry is currently the only speedster known able to do this because after spending 6 months in the speed force he was able to absorb enough of its energies to share that energy with others.

After Oliver Queen as the Spectre unlocked Barry's full potential, greatly augmenting his superhuman speed, he became much faster then before. When his powers were restored by reviving the Speed Force, Barry became even faster than Eva McCholloch, whose fractal photons manipulations let her move at a superluminal speed. Barry's speed is even further greatly augmented after bringing harmony between the four Forces of Nature.

He can change direction with immediate sharp turns without sliding or losing balance and instantly stop running on the spot. He can jump and run along falling debris and launch himself tremendous distances without build-up.

        Barry can generate great amounts of physical force through kinetic energy, simulating superhuman strength, even in a stationary position. Even little exertions from this build-up can generate tremendous force, able to knock a person out. He can propel himself to jump tremendous heights and distances. He can also create substantial frictional force with any object he touches, and exert enough force to hurl people into the air. This seemingly negates the weight of his target, able to move about as if targets are frozen, even in mid-air. This also lets him propel and manipulate the targets' flight path, including launched bullet with no loss of force and hurl them through a powerful barrier, followed by a person. He can completely remove the physical force from massive tidal waves, stabilize a giant singularity, or dispel F3 tornadoes by running around them. He can also snap his fingers to ignite flammable gas with the friction. After escaping the Speed Force, Barry can generate enough force to break down the natural durability of a target, as he effortlessly shattered his way out of his meta-human cell. With enough momentum, he can generate a powerful sonic boom through his punch able to destroy a crashing satellite.

      As a CSI of the

      , Barry is highly skilled in forensics. From a single glance of the crime scene, he can quickly determine much of the events that transpired. Barry can quickly analyze any given data and quickly form accurate theories on the given situation, as seen with the Arrow; Barry correctly determined the Arrow's training background from his green attire and that he has at least one accomplice. Barry was also the first to deduce the true identity of Savitar, managing to put clues together from various things the evil speedster said and did, ultimately concluding that he was in fact a rogue time remnant of himself. Additionally, having learned from Oliver, Barry is able to case environments and predict every inch of them.

     While never trained extensively in hand-to-hand combat, Barry's powers combined with his intelligence and combat skills made him a formidable opponent.

Later, Barry's combat skills improved to such a level that he fought on par against Ultraviolet for while without using his powers and ultimately bested his opponent by dropping stage lights on her. However despite how skilled in combat Barry is, he's still inferior to master level fighters such as when he took on Alex Danvers and Batwoman simultaneously in the alternate timeline, and was overpowered and defeated.

    Because speed is produced by a build-up of heat in the target's atoms, Barry is vulnerable to extreme cold temperatures. Under these conditions, Barry's speed will be greatly reduced.

However, since learning to regulate his body temperature with a buildup of energy, he has a much higher resilience to cold.

     Hyper-metabolism:
    </b>
    While moving at superhuman speeds, Barry burns calories much faster than a normal person. While breaking down food far more efficiently, it requires him to consume large amounts of nutrients. Continued usage of his speed while deprived renders him disoriented and weak before ultimately passing out from low blood glucose. Also, he is unaffected by sedatives as he burns through them too quickly to have any affect. He also cannot experience a buzz as even 500 proof alcohol only intoxicated him for a few seconds. After naturally increasing his connection to the Speed Force, his performance noticeably increased, requiring much less nourishment in-between his meta exploits.

    , Barry's massive build-up of Speed Force energy made his powers highly resilient to such tech, as he instantly smash his way free of a cell in
    the pipeline
    . However, certain meta-powers and more advanced tech can still weaken him, as an upgraded
    B.O.O.T.
    slowed him down considerably; but not to the point of suppressing his powers.
     It is very likely that if he had spent more time in the Speed Force, Barry would become completely immune to such tech, even ones that are very advanced.

     Electricity absorption:

    Barry's unique biology causes his body to produce massive amounts of electricity, which charges his molecules to allow for his accelerated movements. Should Barry be drained of this electrical energy, he will lose his powers. However, as this power is genetically coded into his DNA, he can potentially regain his speed by using more electricity to jump-start it. Once his powers have been "jump-started", his powers will become stronger than they'd previously been and such; attempts to drain the electricity that his body produces are more likely overload the source than disable his speed.

     Apathy:

    When Barry was connected to the

    Negative Speed Force
    , but in the process it eliminated emotions in general. As a result, Barry became overly logical and unempathetic to the point of prioritizing his own goals and not concerning himself with how his actions can affect others. Since Iris' release from the Mirrorverse put her in a critical status and his friends were incapacitated because of him, Barry decided to destroy the
    Artificial Speed Force machine
    and therefore; lost access to this Speed Force.

     Philosopher's Stone
     :
    </b>
    Savitar went back in time and discovered this artifact long ago, using it to hire new meta-human servants to
    his cult
    , and also to further enhance his power. He used this artifact up to the point of being defeated and trapped in the Speed Force within it by his original self until he was able to use it to escape his imprisonment. Savitar was able to use the stone to keep the
    Speed Force bazooka
    from trapping him in the Speed Force again.
     The stone was later destroyed when Savitar planted it in S.T.A.R. Labs, causing a considerable amount of damage to the building.

     Armor
     :
    </b>
    Upon gaining his remarkable speed, Savitar also gained a full-bodied suit of armor that is massive in size and demon-like in form and generated white lightning when he used his speed.
     Acting as a mechanized battle-suit, it opened from the backside. It possessed a thick, retractable spike mounted on each wrist and seemingly was able to disguise his voice. While in the suit, Savitar's normal yellow lightning turned white. The armor was later destroyed by Barry to prove to Savitar that he is nothing like him.

      Savitar is able to disguise his voice so as to not be identified as a megalomaniacal version of his past self. This only applies to Savitar, as present Barry just sounds echoed in the suit. It is unknown if this filter is exclusive to the armor, as the same voice was used when he spoke through the people he possessed.

      Depending on who is in the armor, the glowing parts will change corresponding to the bearer. For Barry, the glow was red while his time remnant had a blue glow. Also, the armor is capable of changing the color of a speedster's lightning as the armor changed Savitar's lightning from yellow to white. As Barry did not run inside the armor, it is unknown what color his lightning would be.

       Enhanced durability:
      </b>
      The armor itself is extremely resilient and enormously durable, enough that Joe West's bullets and shots from the Mercury Labs Energy Rifle ricocheted off him harmlessly. He also takes nearly no damage when the Flash or Wally West attacked him, although he was shown to feel pain when the Flash severed his arm blade with his vibrating hand and Jesse Quick stabbed the armor with the severed arm blade. However, as his suit has been shown to be removable, it's possible that was a reaction to discomfort. So far, he has only been damaged by weapons made from its own material. The armor fares poorly against vibration, as shown by Barry severing an arm blade and later phasing Savitar out of the suit.

       Enhanced strength:
      </b>
      The armor's size, mechanized parts and material give it great strength, allowing Savitar to effortlessly lift, drag and send people flying through the air with one hand. Even when his briefly lost his memories and, therefore, forgot his powers along his younger self, he retained his strength due to his suit, allowing him to lift Caitlin Snow against a wall with one hand. While operating without Savitar being inside it, the suit managed to throw the present Barry several feet and briefly pin him down with its foot before the speedster forced it off him.
