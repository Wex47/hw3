   Nate, however, was feeling 'scars' left behind from the old reality that drew him to realize that the world wasn't quite right and went to Thawne for help, although Thawne simply ordered Snart and Rory to kill him when he was getting too close to the truth. At the time, Rory was starting to have second thoughts and then stopped Snart from killing Nate and they went to get the rest of the team. They went to Ray who had also been feeling the effect of the scars and made a device to 'undo' the changes in someone's brain. With that device, they were able to put themselves back to normal and later Sara, Amaya, and Jax. Through Jax, they learned that Thawne's project was a thermal reactor that he was building for the purpose of incinerating the spear and destroying it to make the new reality permanent.

The speedster was ready to destroy the spear but Darhk, Merlyn, Snart, and Rory arrived as they had been planning to eliminate Thawne with the spear. A fight broke out to try and gain control of the spear with Mick ending up with the spear. Snart tried to have Mick give it to him but Nate tried to remind him what happened the last time he gave his old partner the spear. Amaya then told Mick that she still believed in him and he handed it to her to try and fix this reality. Amaya started to use the spear but she was then frozen solid by Snart in front of everyone before he shattered and killed her. Thawne then took the spear and destroyed it to cement the new reality.

Rip warned that to go back and participate in events they already participated in was dangerous but they felt it was the only move left. Jax then asked what would happen to them if their past selves destroyed the spear and they realized that they would be erased as they wouldn't exist if the Legion hadn't gotten the spear in the first place, making them aberrations.

   Constantine was left at the brink of death after using powerful magic to save one of the kids taken by the shtriga
   so they decided to seek the help of
   Nora Darhk
   who was on the run from the Time Bureau after Ray had helped her escape, believing she deserved a second chance. While the rest of the Legends went on a mission to 1951
   Tokyo
   where they found
   Brigid's diary
   , Ray found Nora who used her magic to save Constantine before turning herself into the Time Bureau, wanting to pay for her mistakes.

However, Nate was shocked when they saw her and the Legends explained everything, though asked her to pretend to be Amaya as to not let on to Hank that they were harboring a fugitive. They got an alert for a creature in 1927
   Paris
   but Hank questioned why so many people were needed so Sara told him they always split into two teams and ordered Ray, Charlie, Constantine and Zari to stay on the ship while she, Nate and Mick brought Hank with them on the mission. Hank got distracted when running into a young
   Ernest Hemingway
   and ignored Nate and Sara's insistence that they needed to do research to know what they were dealing with and had the team go after the monster with Hemingway without knowing what they were up against. Thusly, Hank was hurt during the battle and the team retreated to the

   Nate and Charlie figured out they were dealing with a minotaur and they came up with a plan to lure it out and calm it with music to get it to the Time Bureau unharmed. Although Hank didn't believe in the plan and started talking down to Nate who finally stood up for himself. Hank then told him that if he wouldn't listen to him then perhaps he would listen to his captain, expecting Sara to agree with him. However, she told him Nate's plan would work and if they failed he could fire all of them. It all went according to plan until Hemingway tried to shoot the creature and fight broke out, though Hank eventually managed to calm it when he took up a guitar and started playing a song. Afterward, Hank told them he finally saw the value of the Legends and Nate told Sara that even though it had been fun to be back he belonged at Time Bureau now. Before he left, the Legends had a pizza party together.

Charlie attempted to infiltrate the Sirens, posing as Amaya but Gideon could see through her and she was unable to convince them to change their ways. The sirens were armed and ready to attack her but she ran off in order to change the timeline again.

   Charlie made multiple attempts to restore the timeline and finally reached one were none of the Legends had died or left the team. However, as Zari convinced Constantine to go back and the restore the original timeline, Zara posing as Ava Sharpe went for the Legends help to stop him by saying the Time Bureau had detected magical activity in New Orleans 2018. However, without having ever met Charlie this version of the team still killed fugitives without asking questions. The Legends located the multiple versions of Constantine from different times, believing them to be the shape-shifter and Sara ordered Ray and Mick to shoot. Charlie tried to convince Sara not to do it by revealing her identity but Sara was intent on killing her, making Charlie realize she was the missing piece in the timeline. Just as Ray and Mick were about to shoot Constantine, his efforts to restore the timeline worked and the original timeline was restored.
