    Ava Sharpe
   </b>
   (manufactured 2213) is the twelfth genetically-engineered
   Advanced Variant Automation
   clone
   that
   Rip Hunter
   recruited to work for the
   Time Bureau
   . She later became the director of the Time Bureau after
   Grodd
   killed her predecessor,
   Wilbur Bennett
   , soon joining the
   Legends
   . Ava is also the wife of
   Sara Lance
   .
  </p>
  <p key="aa426577-d512-4fc8-b40e-fc144bca3920">
   Ava was initially on bad terms with
   Sara
   and the
   Legends
   since she thought they were a danger to the timeline. However, she eventually came to appreciate their unorthodox methods and began working with the Legends in order to repair the timeline. This lead to her forming a romance with Sara.
  </p>
  <p key="260c3afc-3687-4b66-9d4c-e0cc8dddd789">
   Following the Time Bureau being shut down due the aftermath of
   Neron
   and
   Heyworld
   , Ava lost her employment and therefore home. Thus, she moved into the

   with Sara and became a full-time member, and eventually co-captain, of the Legends.
  </p>
  <p key="37f6a213-fa2b-4d8c-92e2-4fef8f2c5c34">
   In an aberration timeline, Ava was an assassin for the
   Sirens of Space-Time
   under the name

   Ava and the others began searching to Sara and detaining aliens until they found out that Sara died, but later found out that Sara became a clone and they proposed marriage. Some time later, Ava and Sara got married and together with the Legends they faced
   Bishop
   and his army of
   Zagurons
   . After Bishop's death, the

   In 2012,
   Rip Hunter
   founded the
   Time Bureau
   to protect the timeline. Ava was the twelfth
   clone manufactured by the
   Advanced Variant Automation
   from 2213 who was taken by Rip and had her mind erased of her programming. Like all the other clones before her, she was given false memories of her life and given fake parents, "
   Randy
   " and "
   Pam Sharpe
   ", to cement her life.
   One of these planted memories included playing paintball on her 15th birthday and using a guy as a human shield resulting in no one wanting to play paintball with her ever again.
   After this, Ava was made into one of the leading agents in charge at the Time Bureau with no memories of her true origins.
  </p>
  <p key="e0ac1c7c-45bb-4674-9488-058d25432119">
   Ava had an ex-girlfriend at one point in
   Las Vegas
   , but whether it was a real person or an implanted memory is debatable.

   to the floor and pulled a gun on them as they taunted her.
   Sara Lance
   disarmed her and there was a tense standoff until
   Rip Hunter
   intervened, calming everyone down. Ava kept open hostility against the Legends as they announced that
   Mick Rory
   had found
   Julius Caesar
   on
   Aruba
   . Rip and Ava tracked Rory down to a party in Aruba and they sent in a team to retrieve him and Caesar. However, the team instead found
   a guest
   dressed up like Caesar. Rip decided that the Legends were not fit to restore the timeline and sent them away, but not before they stole the

   Ava and Rip tracked them down as they had managed to find Caesar in 2017, but had accidentally dropped him off in his own age with a history book, causing a massive change in history, allowing the Roman Empire to conquer the entire world. Ava and two agents went to retrieve the book and restore the timeline. However, she ended up captured by Caesar who took her along with his legions as he marched toward
   Rome
   . The Legends performed a rescue mission and attacked his legions. Ava ended up fighting side by side with Sara against the Roman soldiers. After the Legends had solved the timeline Ava told Sara that she now thought of them even worse than before. Ava was present, not long after as Rip allowed the Legends to find anachronisms on their own. She later asked Rip why he would do this and Rip explained that they might need the help of the Legends in the future.

   Not trusting the Legends Ava sent one of her agents,

   . She confronted Sara Lance and issued an arrest of her and her team. Sara replied that she would break her arm if she tried to do so, and they engaged in a baton fight. The two women were evenly matched, eventually losing their batons. Both of them unable to gain the upper hand, they ultimately collapsed in sheer exhaustion, deciding to take a break and grab some water.

   As they talked, the shrunk
   saber-toothed tiger
   walked in, returning to its normal size, chasing a fleeing Ava through the ship. As Ava was cornered, Sara saved her and noted it is the second time. Sara told her that the Legends would solve the mission, and an enraged Ava let slip that Rip had the idea that the Legends could aid them in a fight against an unknown adversary, a notion she strongly disagreed with. As Ray and
   Nate Heywood
   returned to the ship,
   Gideon
   confirmed that the anachronism had been fixed. Ava spoke with Sara in private and carefully mentioned that they had achieved success. Sara questioned her as to the unknown adversary, but Ava refused to tell her, leaving with Agent Green.

   Ava received a distress signal from Gary in 2042 where a

   was trying to kill
   Zari Tomaz

   Vikings
   conquering the New World. Sara assured her that her team had it under control and Ava expressed that them not messing it up would be a "
   Beebo

   Christmas

   The Legends dressed as Vikings and infiltrated the Viking settlement. Ava expressed concern about this strategy as the bureau was against making contact with locals and noted the costumes were ridiculous, although she smiled when Sara told her she looked good. Sara and Ava entered a drinking challenge against two Viking men, in which if they won, then they will take them to see Beebo, a talking blue toy which had been brought back in time causing the Vikings to believe it to be a god. They won which impressed the Viking men who asked who they are married to, planning on killing them to which Ava revealed that she has no interest in husbands, piquing Sara's interest.

   Before anything else can happen, the local
   Freydís
   brought forward
   Mick Rory
   , who had tried to steal Beebo's beer, to be executed by pyre. Sara had
   Leo Snart
   use his cold gun to douse the flames and Ava used it to distract the Vikings by telling them this was a sign from Beebo. Unfortunately,
   Amaya Jiwe
   accidentally made the Beebo toy speak which caused them to blow their cover and the Vikings to attack. Sara and Ava teamed up against Freydís in a sword fight. They were outmatched by Freydis and got disarmed, however, they managed to defeat the Norsewoman when she got distracted by Beebo. During the fight, Mick burned Beebo causing the Vikings to believe that Beebo is a false god.

   Just as it seemed to be over, Ava mentioned Odin Day, making them realize they still hadn't fixed the anachronism. Suddenly,
   Damien
   and
   Nora Darhk
   arrived pretending to be Odin and a Valkyrie. The Vikings bowed down to them after which Sara told the team to retreat, admitting that facing the Darhks is suicide without careful planning. Ava complimented Sara on her cautiousness and Sara asked Ava to contact the Time Bureau in bringing in back-up but they refused to send back-up and ordered Ava to return. Ava explained to Sara that the Time Bureau is in disarray after Rip's betrayal and no longer wanted to fight Darhk as they were unable to handle their magic and had lost many agents trying to fight them already. Sara asked Ava to disregard her orders as she needed her but Ava said she was sorry and advised Sara not to face Darhk before returning to the Bureau.

She contacted Sara who encouraged her and even made her laugh, saying they could both need a glass of wine. Leo Snart, who had seen the call, noted that Ava clearly had a crush on Sara. Later, Ava discovered that the reason she was stopped from seeing Rip was because he had escaped. She immediately went to contact Sara but was surprised when Sara contacted her first.

   The Legends did not know what to do due to the destruction of the ship, so they decided to use Nate's time courier to catch the person responsible, but they did not succeed because the courier had no power. Ava and Gary recalled that on the ship there was a Time Bureau safe that has everything they need to get home. Ava was still upset because everything was wrong, but Sara consoled her. The team found out that the safe was owned by the sheriff and everyone was suspicious of them, so Ava and Nate took it upon themselves to obtain the safe while the others pretended to be a traveling circus.

  <p key="c33bf097-38bc-4d9f-8ebd-1080419459eb">
   The team saw that the contents of the box had been taken by Mick. Because
   J. Edgar Hoover
   was coming for them, the Legends couldn't escape until Zari used the key Constantine gave him to open a door to go to a
   pocket dimension
   just like his home in
   Hell
   .
  </p>
  <p key="a7e3d158-c090-4f93-b09f-b60ee40b0522">
   After resting, the Legends left the pocket dimension, as they planned to find the creator of time travel,
   Gwyn Davies
   . To go unnoticed, Ava and Sara pretended to be a duo of thieves known as the Bullet Blondes to take money and escape with the rest of the team. Upon accidentally murdering Hoover, Ava freaked out and forced Gary to turn into a
   Necrian
   to eat Hoover to avoid suspicion.
  </p>
  <p key="d304c974-f981-43a8-a530-f164a0163a18">
   To remain inconspicuous, Ava and Sara asked Gary to cast a spell to make Nate look like Hoover. When they managed to get on the train, Ava and Sara stayed to rest in the pocket dimension, but Ava saw that Zari was maddened by trying to find out who destroyed the

   . Ava assisted Zari in her investigation and they both considered that the person responsible could have been a former ally or a former enemy.
  </p>
  <p key="561ab985-4eda-4f15-934c-0fecfdf4985f">
   A short time later, Ava, Sara, and Zari had to get out of the pocket dimension to save Nate, but they managed to fix things by proving that they are the famous Bullet Blondes. The Legends watched with surprise as Hoover appeared alive, but realized that it was a
   robot Hoover
   , which was one of Zari's theories. Ava and the Legends had to flee in Hoover's car to avoid the robot's explosion.

   Ava is very intelligent, incredibly ambitious, and always believes she is the most intelligent individual in the room. She is very work oriented and believes in putting personal issues aside when it comes to completing a mission. She is often quite ruthless in obtaining her goals and Ava's drive for perfection has left many discarded friendships in her wake.
  </p>
  <p key="85ed9db2-0e0f-4a45-b1fa-417ac52f7b1d">
   Ava originally had an unshaken confidence in the
    Time Bureau
    as well as her own capabilities as an operative. She believed that the
    Legends
    were a loose cannon, due to the fact that they caused more problems than they actually fixed. She felt superior to
    Sara Lance
    and completely disregarded the latter's achievements when they first met. As Ava is a woman of rules and regulations, she was highly annoyed by Sara's reckless behavior.
  </p>
  <p key="5ec3457c-6fe1-4dbd-ba88-0951f648bd9c">
   Ava has a cruel side like when the legends refused to give her the location of Zari Tomaz because they knew that she would be returned to Argus Prison where she would be tortured. Ava fired at the
   <i key="3fbba2db-25e2-4183-8c24-3b530b8e5538">

   </i>
   with her Ship and threatening to blow them up. She is also stubborn which could be seen in her insistence on pursuing and punishing the Legends for their breaking of rules despite Rip letting them run free.
  </p>
  <p key="d660f1fa-7769-48dc-a28e-985177e398b6">
   Ava prefers her work to life, for example when Sara told her that Hank kidnapped magical creatures and experimented with them Ava did not care because Hank was the one who paid for everything, even she told Sara to leave her.
  </p>
  <p key="f578e6c2-a440-4f9a-89db-49ebb97e8169">
   After
    Martin Stein
    's death and the Time Bureau's inability to cope with
    Damien Darhk
    , Ava grew more tolerant and even friendly towards Sara and the Legends. They worked together on a mission and afterward found they respected and even seemed to admire each other.
    Ava also became less concerned about following protocols and less strict. This also seemed expressed in that she began wearing her hair loose instead of in a knot. Ava also seems to be developing a sibling-like bond with
    Nate Heywood
    , whose
    family
    Thanksgiving dinner she attended and enjoyed.
    She has also shown to enjoy the writing of
    Mick Rory
    ,
    and she seems to be on good enough terms with
   <a href="Ray Palmer.html" key="fac709a5-7088-41e0-b6fd-da4acd70c956" title="Ray Palmer">

   that she could call him "teddy bear" without any harsh feelings.
  </p>
  <p key="f8d47677-19fa-4cb6-b634-62a9169b45c7">
   After getting together with Sara, Ava is shown to care very much about her, though knowing of Sara's past lovers left Ava insecure as she was afraid Sara would not settle for a monogamous relationship.
    She is seen to have a romantically loyal side, appalled when Constantine nonchalantly told Ava that he (apparently) instructed Ray to kill Sara, as a fail-safe, in the event that Mallus fully takes over Sara's being. Ava also expressed some jealousy when she heard Constantine slept with Sara (which was just prior to Sara openly admitting Ava was her girlfriend).
  </p>
  <p key="60d4e391-ec65-4591-8a82-1b0203d76dce">
   Ava cares a great deal about professional boundaries in the workplace, especially around her girlfriend.
