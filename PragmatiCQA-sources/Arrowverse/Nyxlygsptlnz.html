   Nyxly was banished to the
   Phantom Zone
   for the crime of staging a coup to overthrow her father, who she considered a paranoid narcissist who was threatened by anyone who might take his power. Nyxly's younger brother, Bryxly, was her co-conspirator, but when their plan failed her turned on his sister, letting her take the fall.
  </p>
  <p key="5608cf6a-f981-420e-8af4-f545958d99e7">
   At some point, Nyxly met
   Az-Rel
   and stole his lighter, because she needed to make campfires since she did not have her magical powers.

   Nyxly stumbled upon
   Scar
   and his men capturing
   Zor-El
   and attempting to take an injured
   Supergirl
   . She lied about approaching
   Phantoms
   and enraged
   White Martians
   , causing the bandits to flee. She took Kara to her small refuge, where she told Kara that Scar was going to sacrifice Zor-El to a creature that lives within the nearby Shadow Lake. Kara revealed she was sent to the Zone by a
   madman
   , and until recently she thought her father was dead.
  </p>
  <p key="906518f7-8d06-472e-9998-ccdf11f99cdf">
   Nyxly divulged the location of Shadow Lake to Kara. Kara wanted to go alone to save her father, so Nyxly confided in her that her father had murdered her brother and banished her to the Phantom Zone because he saw them as a threat to his power. Kara decided they should both go to save Zor-El, since they both don't belong in the Zone. Nyxly was able to remove her power-dampening cuff with a powerful orb from her dimension, granting her magic again. She used her magic to heal Kara's leg and began to feel like her old self again.
  </p>
  <p key="943e83c8-f14d-4cb8-8c79-f5abb2673ae2">
   Nyxly teleported herself into the den of Scar and his men, and with a snap of her fingers she caused the bandits to disappear. Kara untied Zor-El and revealed that since her
   mother
   built the Phantom Zone, she knew of a way out and Nyxly agreed to work with them.

   Using Scar's form, Nyxly attacked Zor-El and told Kara that she chased Scar away before he could hurt Zor-El further. Nyxly and Kara went to the Anchor to fix the mirror, but Nyxly revealed that she pretended to be Scar and planned to go to the fifth dimension and get revenge, but before she would visit Earth to destroy it, this made Kara angry, and the two clashed. Nyxly was trapped in the Anchor's explosion, but managed to survive.

   Upon exiting the dream realm, Nyxly reunited Nia with her mother for twenty-four hours. Nyxly escaped, but was captured by an alien smuggler named
   Mitch
   . When she was imprisoned, Nyxly revealed to Mitch that she can help him get revenge, so Mitch released her. Nyxly ordered him to find an alien scientist for a special trap for Kara. Nyxly managed to obtain her fifth dimensional
   orb
   and obtained an evil trap for Kara. Nyxly donned a new outfit and faced Kara for revenge. After a tough fight, Nyxly made Kara fall into her trap and knocked down a building, but Kara called on Mxyzptlk to help her.

  <p key="b5a54d39-94da-42f5-8ea3-9e648c061dad">
   After Kara and Mxyzptlk escaped, Nyxly returned to
   Mitch
   's ship to locate her old friend and lock him in his magic orb to obtain his power. To get the attention of the
   Superfriends
   , Nyxly summoned a giant cat to attack
   National City
   . Nyxly appeared to reveal that if the Superfriends don't deliver Mxy, she will destroy the entire city.
  </p>
  <p key="74cd126f-8904-4393-9864-ee9402e36d17">
   Nyxly realized the deception of Kara and
   Nia Nal
   , so she attacked them until they arrived
   Querl Dox
   ,
   Alex Danvers
   , and
   J'onn J'onzz
   , but she captured them. Since the heroes did not want to summon Mxy, Nyxly summoned a dragon to attack them until Mxy appeared to surrender. She rejected Kara's words and locked Mxy in his orb. Nyxly returned with Mitch to start the search for the Seven
   AllStone Totems
   .
   Nyxly was upset and argued with Mitch about not being able to find the location of the first totem. Upon reloading the orb, Nyxly was thrilled to learn that she can now begin her search.

  <p key="33fdce08-2b10-4096-9399-18a5391fa61b">
   Nyxly found the Courage Totem in a museum, but was confronted by the Superfriends. During the fight, the totem was divided into two parts. Nyxly traveled on the totem to pass her test and relived the day she started her rebellion against her father. Nyxly murdered the king, believing that this was the proof, but failed to kill him. Nyxly repeated her test and wanted to kill her brother for betraying her in his rebellion, but he amended things with him and Nyxly passed the totem test, managing to get the other half and was happy because now she only had six totems left.

   Nyxly repeated her test and wanted to kill her brother for betraying her in his rebellion, but she amended things with him and Nyxly passed the totem test, managing to get the other half. Nyxly was furious that Kara was still happy despite the situation, and the two had a connection due to the totem.

  <p key="7f19dfcc-9c21-4ef5-a565-b27b78769b3c">
   Nyxly met
   Igor Starros
   , who he stole the Humanity Totem from him and caused people to lose their humanity and start fighting each other. Losing the totem, Nyxly went looking for it, but absorbed all the people's humanity. Nyxly got the totem, but seeing that it didn't work with her, she threw it so that Kara could then get the totem.

  <p key="809d19ea-c8b3-4e89-8ca9-76067aaa19f6">
   Nyxly received a bracelet to retain the magic of the Courage Totem to face the Superfriends. She tried to get the Hope Totem until she was confronted by Kara and J'onn. Nyxly and Mitch planned to kidnap
   William Dey
   to make a trade with Kara. Nyxly threatened to kill William, and she got the totem, but Kara managed to save William and retrieve the totem. Nyxly returned to the annoying ship and received a special gift from a secret admirer, which contained a
   Lexosuit

   Nyxly realized that the AI ​​in her suit had its voice to make it more comfortable. To go to the dream realm, Nyxly released a nightmare monster. Nyxly confronted Nia and her sister,
   Maeve Nal

   Lex Luthor
   , who offered to help her get the totems.

  <p key="37351eb0-6053-4669-a4a3-90e890b273c4">
   Nyxly refused Lex's help. At night, Nyxly tried to get the fake Love Totem, but it was a trap from the Superfriends until she was saved by Lex. Nyxly was still shocked and didn't think Lex had feelings for her until she learned that Luthor was from the future.

  <p key="e44ec0d3-b5be-4111-b3d7-1d72848904ec">
   Nyxly happily agreed to join Lex, and they teamed up to get the Love Totem. Nyxly and Lex faced Kara and J'onn, but escaped to survive, leaving the totem in the hands of the heroes. Nyxly learned that the Totem of Hope is still standing and they would both continue their plans.

  <p key="3a79ad0c-e74f-47bd-a682-8f90054df1fa">
   Nyxly and Lex searched for the Totem of Truth. The duo faced the Superfriends for the totem. Nyxly and Lex used the Lexosuits to fight. She was about to kill Kara, but Nyxly was defeated by the Kryptonian. She and Mitch managed to escape with Lex from the ship. Nyxly lost the Totem of Truth, which was taken by Kara. Nyxly was impressed that Lex truly loves her. The duo infiltrated the
   Tower
   to kidnap
   Esme
   . By kidnapping the girl and murdering William, Nyxly and Lex escaped.
