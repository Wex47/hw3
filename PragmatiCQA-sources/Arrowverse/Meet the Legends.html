   In the temporal zone, Ray does his confessional interview. When doing the interview, the Waverider and documentary crew feels time quake and the computer Gideon is damaged. They land in tsarist Russia 1917. The Legends and the crew go to the funeral of
   Grigori Rasputin
   , an emperor's advisor of Romanov family and notorious figure who is charlatan's fraud and he was difficult to kill him by cyanide, pistol and drowning before he finally died. Suddenly, Grigori rises from the dead, as he is also the cause of time quake and the crew discusses how to solve the situation.

  <p key="5ea225fe-c97f-4398-8d6f-853b7df2e4ec">
   Meanwhile in New York, Constantine and Gary go to the apartment to investigate an emergence of the demon possessing a young boy Edgar, whom his mother expresses severe concern for him. John discovers that the boy is possessed by Masher, the resident from Hell who took vacation from his realm and wanted some fun.
  </p>
  <p key="508e749a-08ff-4369-a1d5-b5aafb27de39">
   In Waverider, while repairing Gideon, Sara still copes with Oliver's death and is angry that no one told her about the documentary. When the other Legends discuss about Rasputin, they find out that he is going to kill the emperor's nephew Jusupov, who organised the assassination on him. They arrive too late, as Rasputin killed him. Nate and Ray (who is shrunken as atom) go to his manor and Nate tells Grigori about to do interview with him. While doing interview, Ava, Rory and Mona are also in manor to prepare to kill Rasputin, although Mona wrote the letter for him who believes will save the history, but Rory takes the letter from her. In the interview, Rasputin feels that Nate was once in love with someone and lost it, and offers to help him by hypnotizing him and Nate accepts the offer.

  <p key="f5be52d0-cfd7-4383-bac5-d045d5e07f28">
   Back in New York, John asks Masher about Astra Logue's release of the souls of the worst villains in the human history from Hell. When Masher confirms it, John exorcises Masher from Edgar's body, sending him in his realm. John and Gary contact Sara and Behrad about this situation and one of them who was released from Hell is Grigori Rasputin. While Grigori hypnotizes Nate, Ava shoots him with sniper, but the bullet doesn't kill him. The soldiers attack, while Rory and Mona try to kill Rasputin. Ray rescues Nate and everyone retreats to Waverider. The Legends realize they cannot kill Rasputin because the part of his soul is in Hell. Sara is also angry that no one remembered the Crisis while she did and is the reason why she hates the documentary where the other Legends were involved.
  </p>
  <p key="6e600f9e-4efc-49eb-b1fc-de2e65ae72a9">
   When Nate feels that he met and was in love with the woman from another time, Behrad thinks that Gideon was damaged because of time fracture when talking to Sara. Soon, they watch the interview with Rasputin by documentary crew and Rasputin invited Romanov family for the dinner, but actually wants to kill them to become an immortal emperor.
  </p>
  <p key="8ce1a9f4-d20b-4422-9ce7-987290a18a4c">
   The Legends infiltrate his manor and Romanov family is invited (minus their daughters). Rasputin tries to kill them with poisoned family cakes and Sara and Behrad prevent this. Then Grigori, with magical amulet, hypnotizes the army and Behrad, attacking Sara. Other Legends come to assist and attack. Rasputin then hypnotizes Rory, Nate and Mona (as Wolfie), while Sara, Ava and Ray try to subdue them. When Rasputin tells them about being immortal, Sara quickly throws shrunken Ray into his mouth. Ray increases to own size and kills Grigori, saving the Romanov family as well.
  </p>
  <p key="0b8ce9de-4951-482c-8e1b-e5e7e3d2b1a3">
   The Legends are invited in showing the documentary "Meet the Legends", telling the audience to enjoy the film, but they decide (to keep the time travel as secret) to tell them that it was all fake, causing the audience being angry and shocking Kevin Harris for his destroyed project. Soon after, John comes to them and informs about the release of the villain's souls from Hell. John attempts to back in Hell with Rasputin's soul by drinking his blood in order to perform a spell, one of the remains collected by Legends after defeating him to prevent his reforming. Rory decides to give Mona his alias Rebecca Silver as his successor to write the books.

   After Gideon was repaired, Nate discovers the footage in her computer (from Heyworld event) and sees the anomaly in the form of Zazi, who was changed into Behrad because of changing her future, but Nate still doesn't remember her name. The holographic message comes from her, telling him that she was aware what would happen to her and tells him to find her. Nate tells Gideon to replay the message, but Gideon is not aware of this anomaly.
