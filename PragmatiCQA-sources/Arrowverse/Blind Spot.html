   Laurel is at her desk, about to swallow some pills, when she is interrupted by someone, telling her that there is a call waiting for her from the mental institute. After Laurel learns of Maya's death, (that the woman's heart gave out on her) she becomes more sure that Sebastian Blood is not at all what he seems, and suspects he might have killed her.

   Oliver approaches Roy at Verdant and asks about what happened at the rally. However, Roy claims that he is okay before walking away. He then learns that Laurel wants to talk to the Arrow. The Arrow and Laurel share a tense meeting on a rooftop to discuss Laurel's theories about Sebastian being a shady politician.

   At Queen Consolidated, Oliver, Felicity and Diggle discuss Laurel's claim that Sebastian is really not what he seems. They wonder if she is just setting another trap for him. Felicity discovers that there is a file on Sebastian's past at the
   Starling City Archives
   , but it isn't digital and you need a key card to get access to it, awhich an assistant district attorney might have. Laurel meets the Arrow at her apartment, where he asks her to come with him to the city archives. They break into the Archives, but Laurel is shocked to see that Sebastian's file has been cleaned (courtesy of Slade). Laurel returns to her apartment to find Officer Daily waiting for her.

   Starling Slasher
   , a serial killer who murders prostitutes with a dagger. Sure enough, the man picks her up and take her to an empty car lot. Just as he is about to kill Sin, Roy rips the car door off and starts beating him. Sin realizes that if she can't stop Roy, he will kill the man. She intervenes but Roy tosses her aside, though comes to his senses after seeing what he has done. Roy takes the man to the hospital and freaks out on Thea once she shows up.

As he begins choking her, Oliver arrived and engages the man in the skull mask. The man gets the upper hand and prepares to finish Oliver off when Laurel grabs a spare gun the former dropped and shoots him several times, killing him.

   Later, while Oliver is sleeping, Sara takes the radio from him and calls Ivo. He pleads with Sara to come back to the ship with the Mirakuru, and he needs her. Unsure whether to believe him, she hangs up on him. The next night, Sara calls Ivo and tells him that when he rescued her, she thought he was her savior. She expresses how Ivo made her feel if she was part of something big, but condemns him for experimenting on and torturing his subjects. Ivo loses his temper, calling Sara an "ungrateful bitch", and vows to hunt down, torture, and experiment on her and Oliver. Once again, Sara hangs up on him. She sees Oliver standing behind her and hands him the radio before telling him they have to go and find Slade.
