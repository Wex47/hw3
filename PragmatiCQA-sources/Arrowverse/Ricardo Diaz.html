   Ricardo Diaz was born in

    Starling City
   </a>
   and had a tough childhood. Diaz spent his early years trying hard to make
   his father
   proud of him, even if it meant pretending to be someone he wasn't. After his father's death, Diaz was sent to
   Zandia Orphanage
   sometime before 1986.
  </p>
  <p key="3899b30c-26ec-4ceb-a566-19bb4d03300c">
   While growing up at the orphanage, Diaz was forced to fight for every scrap of food he could get. He was often bullied and mentally scarred by an older boy named
   Jesse Federico
   . Jesse tortured Diaz by burning his forearms and attempted to destroy the last picture that he had of his late father. Diaz reached into the flames of the burning bucket to get the picture back, resulting in extreme burns and blisters which rendered his arm scarred and scaled for weeks. Jesse also made Diaz act as his "servant" and treated him like an animal, to the point that his frequently calling Diaz a "loser" traumatized Diaz even into his adult life. In order to contain the anger and fear instilled into him during his childhood, Diaz named it the "Dragon", doing everything possible to "control it, so that it does not control [him]".
  </p>
  <p key="0888fc2d-41ee-4d99-a2cc-4d33d4d1d785">
   Growing up, Diaz joined the
   Scorpions
   , an organized crime group operating in
   the Glades
   of Starling City, eventually becoming known under the alias "Dragon" and gaining an extensive criminal record. However, at some point in his life, he started to operate on his own and became a powerful crime lord heading an illegal drug operation responsible for the production and sale of a steroid derived from
   Vertigo
   that increases combat efficiency and concentration, all while remaining off charts and covering up his tracks.
   In the criminal underworld, Diaz’s drugs earned such a reputation that

   , who had become acquainted with him at some point, credited her survival of Lian Yu’s destruction entirely to their effects, having been rendered entirely in debt to Diaz as a result.

   In 2013, Diaz began his rise to power as a major crime lord.
   Eventually, Diaz became leader of his gang at the time, the Scorpions,
   though sometime after this he was arrested, receiving a life sentence without conditional release. These charges were later dropped by the

   </span>
   on grounds of a legal technicality, resulting in Diaz being released from prison, along with being granted a large sum of money in compensation.
   With this money, Diaz expanded his gang and enterprise; including the addition of many government officials to his payroll, such as the
   District attorney
   of
   <a href="Star City.html" key="5695ca19-93e6-4f72-9ebc-f0de98669604" title="Star City">

   Sam Armand
   , who Diaz bought by paying the medical bills of the latter's son.
  </p>
  <p key="3ca0e04f-4d2f-47e4-9872-6d85eaa1df32">
   In early 2017, Diaz hired
   Karl Iscove
   to kill
   Owen Post
   - the son of master hacktivist and
   Helix
   's leader
   Cayden James
   - while wearing a hooded costume in order to influence James and make him start a war with

    Green Arrow

   . Then, he killed Iscove to tie up loose ends and doctored a photo of

   as Green Arrow; though it is unknown how he knew the Green Arrow's real identity.
  </p>
  <p key="14a22d3d-5173-43d0-b1cc-6521883d7145">
   Later in the year, Diaz leaked the photo to the

   of Oliver Queen as the Green Arrow, thus placing the mayor under indictment, arousing controversy and suspicion towards him and limiting his work as a vigilante.

   Less than a month after his release from prison, Diaz led his men to retrieve the components of a military-grade 3D printer but they were intercepted and defeated by

   . Hidden in the shadows, the Dragon set off a smoke bomb and escaped before the heroes could catch him.
  </p>
  <p key="2d8ab3ce-a6da-4beb-af3c-64abc514417e">
   Sometime later, Diaz met
   <a href="John Diggle.html" key="b423f648-df54-4e59-8112-0cac5f3555b9" title="John Diggle">
    John Diggle

   when he went directly to his steroid manufacturer, hoping to get an extra portion of drugs. After cracking jokes about Diggle's muscles, he explained that he had to be careful because he did not yet have permission from the Food and Drug Administration. Regardless, he then had one of his men give Diggle what he‘d asked for before walking off.
  </p>
  <p key="39890dbb-2cb2-4027-8a61-e2c790f74a3d">
   Later that night, the Dragon assisted his crew with stealing more components for the 3D military printer, this time from the biological department of

    Palmer Technologies.
   </a>
   However, as he stepped out of his car, he was attacked again by vigilantes. The Green Arrow, who was actually Diggle himself at the time, was caught off-guard at the sight of Diaz, who managed to shoot the Green Arrow before escaping. Shortly after, Diaz checked the progress in his laboratory when Team Arrow entered the building. The Dragon, not wanting his product to fall into their hands, dropped a drum of petrol, lighting it on fire and burning all of his drugs, before escaping from the fire.

   Later Diaz, along with James and Laurel, visited
   Jerry Bertinelli
   , asking him to rethink the matter of selling them the port - the last thing in Star City belonging to the
   Bertinelli crime family

However, after the Dragon and the rest of the cabal appeared in front of him, the emerald archer, not expecting this, was forced to escape in order to avoid a fight. When Cayden allowed him to escape, Diaz questioned his decision. Cayden assured him that Green Arrow's death would come eventually.

   After Captain
   Frank Pike
   was killed in an elevator thanks to Cayden, Diaz sent pictures to the new police captain
   Kimberly Hill
   of her family as leverage to get her to do whatever he said.
   Later, after Sheck was killed and the cabal started to suspect Sobel for murdering him, Diaz was present at a meeting to discuss it. James sent Diaz and Anatoly to see that his bomb was moved and, after Sobel was exposed as a traitor of the cabal, Diaz assisted Anatoly in torturing him, but they did not obtain any results and were later forced to flee as both branches of Team Arrow attacked their lair.

   Later, Diaz and the rest of the cabal were thanked by James for their contributions to his plan as he intended to activate the bomb late in the evening, so he officially ended cooperation with his allies, promising to transport them away from the city and transfer money to their bank accounts. However, after noticing the promised vehicle did not show up, Diaz departed on his own in order to not to be there when the detonation of the bomb occurred and suggested his former partners to do the same. While leaving, however,

  <p key="c52551eb-b807-4bc9-aaa1-68ddea16e79d">
   Wild Dog, Terrific, and the captured crime lord rendezvoused with everyone else at where James had the bomb. There Diaz questioned why James would believe the vigilantes over his partners. When James declared that he only trusts facts and spouted on how none of them knows what's like to lose a son, Diaz took the opportunity to tell Cayden that his grief was making him crazy. As James pulled out his detonator and demanded the one who ordered the murder to come forward, Laurel confessed and started to insult the hacker in order to upset him. Knowing that she was lying, James slapped her, not realizing that the bomb activator interferes with the action of the collar blocking her powers, so she used her sonic scream in response, thus allowing herself and everyone else to escape. As he was leaving the building, Diaz was pursued by his old acquaintance Diggle. Revealing his true fighting skill, the Dragon swiftly took down Diggle, a man who could fight on par with Oliver Queen himself, and escaped.

   After Cayden James was arrested and sent to the interrogation room at the
   SCPD
   headquarters, Diaz appeared to him revealing that he'd used James to take over Star City, explaining that "it's prime for the taking" and that James was narrow-minded to think he was controlling him; in reality, everything had gone according to Diaz’s plan. He also claimed James didn’t understand that things should be taken over and not destroyed while revealing he had Captain Hill on his payroll. He then murdered James while telling him that he was the one who had his son killed and calmly exited the building.
   He then had his corrupt cops cover up James's murder by making it look like he was killed by another inmate on his way to

   Afterward, Diaz explained all of his plan to Anatoly, who eagerly decided to cooperate with the gangster, while arranging a meeting with the Laurel at his command. In the meantime, the Dragon trained with new fighters who would power the ranks of his team. When he saw Laurel, he was very angry at her for having betrayed him and for trying to run away, but he understood she was afraid of

   Loading Roy in a truck, Diaz was halted by Speedy. The Dragon nearly killed her in combat before Green Arrow stopped him. The two archers pointed their arrows at Diaz, but the crime lord remained calm as the police were arriving, as even the ones who weren't on his payroll found the anti-vigilante act to be right. Green Arrow ordered Speedy to drive off with Roy while he dealt with Diaz. As she left, Diaz reminded him that he's powerless against the police, which forced him to escape a moment before the arrival of the Dragon's crooked police officers. Diaz later texted Laurel, congratulating her on her performance tonight.

   After Anatoly was arrested by a bunch of SCPD officers led by Lieutenant Dinah Drake while selling Vertigo for him, Diaz ordered Armand to have him released under the quibble that he was arrested without a warrant. Later that night, he waited for Officer
   Martin Hurst

Having seen she was studying her late counterpart's old schoolbooks, Diaz told her that she didn't have to do it as people like them "make the law" and that she don't need to change in order to "impress her old man" like he did when he was younger. Later, after former district attorney Sam Armand and former police captain Kimberly Hill accused mayor Oliver Queen of obstructing justice while he fired them both (actually because he discovered they were on Diaz's payroll), Laurel watched the news in Diaz's hideout alongside him. He complimented her for the idea and then showed the last champion of Vertigo after Team Arrow's raid to the core of his drug operation, which led Laurel to kiss him.
  </p>
  <p key="5572b0f0-7f95-485b-a9db-edf2ef12f9a4">
   Sometime after Laurel joined Diaz's organization, he introduced her to his associate

   After Oliver was drugged via Vertigo by
   Kullens
   , a councilman on Diaz's payroll, a few hours before his meeting with the Council regarding his probable impeachment due to the accusation of Armand and Hill, he briefly hallucinated about Diaz who, after having stabbed
   Raisa
   and put a dagger in Oliver's abdomen, asked himself why nobody of his previous enemies ever thought to just kill him straight, then adding there are more things he intended to break in him.
  </p>
  <p key="6145a41f-98e9-468c-9bb1-abccd4eb7906">
   That night, at 10:13, Diaz entered the SCPD station as he does every night in order to pay his policemen when the Hood entered the building ready to fight him. Diaz was eager for the Hood to attack him and his policemen, but he was stopped by

   The following morning Laurel checked up on Diaz at the station in the captain's office while his men were cleaning, asking him why he didn't just kill Oliver. Diaz replied that he "is more dangerous as a martyr than as Green Arrow" Laurel asked what's next and Diaz said that their next move would be to spread the word that Star City is now "open for business" with Mayor Queen out of office.

   About a week later Diaz and Laurel went to
   Blüdhaven
   in order to meet
   Eric Cartier
   , the son of an influential member of the
   Quadrant
   . While waiting outside Cartier's nightclub, Diaz told Laurel that if you want something truly special, you have to be patient. Cartier soon arrived and the three got started. Diaz proposed to Cartier to use Star City as a place to run the Quadrant's business in exchange of having a seat at the table of the organization. However, Cartier asked him to find
   Robert Baylor
   , an agent of his organization who was caught by the FBI, in order to show them if he was able to operate at their level. Diaz put on a smile and agreed. After the meeting, though, Diaz went to the club's bathroom and smashed a mirror in frustration, bruising his hand.
  </p>
  <p key="32a07c62-e169-43e1-9422-eb85a983c4e3">
   In less than a day Diaz found the man while discovering that he was working with the feds and, as Laurel had demonstrated to be skeptical about his excessive concessions to the Quadrant, he reminded her that once he had won a place in the organization, he would have an empire. After Diaz gave the information on Baylor to Cartier, however, he asked for both him and his "pretty little friend" to get him in order to interrogate him so they could find out what exactly he told the Justice Department. Diaz became angry that Cartier was wasting his time, but nonetheless, agreed, hoping to get a meeting with Cartier, Sr. Before leaving with Laurel, Cartier took note of Diaz's bruised hand and asked what happened. Diaz simply told him that he "got angry at someone."
  </p>
  <p key="daf5e7e7-1fa0-40e9-90b8-3b7a83e716ac">
   Diaz and Laurel arrived at the FBI's safehouse, and while Laurel handled the feds at the front, Diaz went around back. Killing all the guards he came across mercilessly, Dragon met up with Baylor and ordered him to move. He contacted Cartier for transportation. As the two walked out of the safehouse, Diaz didn't buy that Baylor kept quiet. When Cartier's car arrived, both Diaz and Baylor were shot by Cartier's driver. Diaz survived thanks to a bulletproof vest.
  </p>
  <p key="08bb5378-1158-4aaf-8bcf-d91cc3282bd0">
   Arriving back at Cartier's nightclub, Laurel questioned why they weren't heading back to Star City. Diaz replied that it was time to take what's his. He defeated all of Cartier's men alongside Laurel and later on, tortured Cartier while telling him of his childhood at the orphanage and asking him why he tried to kill him. After Cartier revealed that he and his father never talked about him to the Quadrant because he was "a nobody" and that they wanted to take Star City from his hands, Diaz beat Cartier to a pulp and ordered Cartier to take him to the place where the Quadrant‘s meetings were held.
  </p>
  <p key="f5b69afb-c602-4ddf-96e7-ae58534af1ad">
   While they were driving to the place, Laurel asked Diaz if what happened with Jesse still tormented him and he confirmed it does, because he felt that Jesse was right and he was "a loser"; when she tried to cheer him up by saying he wasn't one anymore, he told her about how he named his fear "The Dragon" and how for years it was everything he had but if he managed to become a member of the Quadrant he would get enough power to ensure it would not be used by anyone against him. Laurel compared him to

   When they arrived at the Quadrant's headquarters,
   Villa Centanni
   , Diaz and Laurel broke inside using Cartier as a human bomb and slaughtered dozens of their men with both their bare hands and several gunshots while making their way to the hall where the four leaders of the Quadrant met. Once again Diaz proposed to gave them Star City in exchange for a place in the organization and, as one of the members declared there are no free chairs at their table,
   Remy Cartier
   started taunting him, calling him a "street thug" and a "loser". Immediately, Diaz shot him in the head, leaving a chair open that he took as being welcomed into the Quadrant.
  </p>
  <p key="ccc507cc-80dc-4239-9ced-ee8dc79cd49d">
   Back at Star City, Laurel asked why Diaz was still off, despite getting what he wanted. Diaz told her that there was one last thing he needed to do and went to Jesse's house and kidnapped him, bringing him on a rooftop over his city. After having shown him the last fragment of his father's picture he had kept for over thirty-two years, while ignoring Laurel's pleas not to do it, he cruelly poured gas on and set Jesse on fire while stating that he was “not a loser anymore". He then threw the picture in the fire and walked off.

   After Jesse's murder, Laurel began to avoid meeting Diaz, until he summoned her personally while a tailor was making him a custom suit, in order to announce to her that the new mayor, Quentin, needed to be persuaded in respecting some "ground rules", and that she needed to set up a meeting between them. Though reticent, Laurel did as ordered and took Quentin to their favorite Chinese restaurant, confessing that she was sorry as Diaz entered revealing the intimacy between them and telling him to sign a few documents to privately sell some municipal property before leaving with her.
  </p>
  <p key="a2672cd0-ccf7-440f-953d-eeae7aa563af">
   After returning to his hiding place, Diaz delightfully found out that Anatoly brought Oliver Queen to him. The criminal began to kick the shod vigilante, mocking him, until Anatoly interrupted, exclaiming that every drop of blood he drew from a chained-up man was a sign of weakness, “his weakness". This drove Diaz to challenge Oliver to a duel, setting the rule that if he would win, Oliver would have to leave the city forever, and vice versa if Oliver would have be the winner. Thus, they went on to fight. The Dragon was a serious challenge to Oliver, even overpowering and knocking him down for a while, but Oliver ultimately managed to seize an opening to knock down the Dragon and began to hold his opponent in a headlock, ordering him to give up. Unexpectedly, the crime lord pulled out a knife and pierced the side of Oliver's abdomen, winning in a dishonest fight and stating that "life ain’t fair". Then Diaz ordered Anatoly to lock Oliver in a cell.

   A few hours later Laurel came to Diaz, who handed him the signed papers, but it turned out that these were not necessary for him and he took them away as he only wanted to know if he could manipulate Quentin. When Laurel asked what happened if Lance didn't sign, Diaz abruptly stuck his knife in his desk, implying that he would've killed Quentin if he didn't. Immediately after, Diaz ordered his men to bring out the beaten Oliver from his cell and had him arrested by revoking his parole and anticipating his trial at the following week, on May 3.

   she didn't tell the truth about who was hidden under Green Arrow's mask. When Laurel defended her actions by saying Diaz didn't tell her to do so, he told her that the jury would be calling her to testify. After Laurel argued that she couldn't fool a court room, Diaz brought up the behavior of the woman for several weeks. When Laurel didn't convince him that she was fine, Diaz unexpectedly began to strangle Laurel, threatening her and saying that he expected her cooperation and a solid testimony in court. She nodded in fear and Diaz released her, saying he had to go to the courthouse.

   Later, as Rene Ramirez testified,
   his daughter
   was silently brought into the room by Diaz himself, a silent threat forcing him to testify against Oliver. Reluctantly, Rene told the court that Oliver was the Green Arrow while Diaz smiled at him, keeping his hands on her shoulders. After Rene's testimony, Diaz left the courtroom, giving Rene a nod of approval. Exiting the courthouse, Diaz was ambushed by Diggle and Dinah. Before the two could do anything, Diaz' corrupt cops arrived and surrounded them. Diaz let them go however, knowing he would have to testify if they had an "accident".

Diaz witnessed this on the news and became furious.

  <p key="328be1ec-3b87-449c-a7c9-786ea95bcea0">
   To ensure that Oliver would still be found guilty, Diaz paid of the jury. Unfortunately, Chance disguised himself as
   Judge C. McGarvey
   and acquitted Oliver. Therefore, that night, at the docks, Diaz ordered his men to bring him McGarvey. When McGarvey failed to convince Diaz that it wasn't him who freed Oliver, Diaz killed him for his incompetence. Laurel then appeared and confronted him at first managing to overpower the crime lord and his men but ultimately being subdued as Diaz used a power-dampening device to suppress her sonic scream, before to taking her captive and telling her that his next plan would be to kill Oliver and everyone he loves.

   Diaz called Cassamento to the SCPD and accused her of betraying him. Cassamento denied this just as Cosby arrived and informed Diaz that he's tracked where Team Arrow was; the old
   helix hideout

   The Dragon filled the base with noxious gas and he entered the area himself, wearing a gas mask. There he had the chance to kill Oliver and Felicity but, before he could, the building exploded and he was wounded by a bomb hidden in the stairwell that left scars on the right side of his face. Despite his wounds, Diaz managed to escape and, later, met with

   Longbow Hunters
   . He then gave him the false coordinates of a hiding place, knowing that the Russian would give the information to Oliver.

   Soon after, he called Mayor Lance, whom he ordered to remove the FBI from Star City, threatening to murder Laurel; the mayor did not agree, which upset the crime lord. After hanging up, Diaz mocked the captured Laurel by telling her that her "daddy" didn't love her like he did the real Laurel. Diaz then reminded how Laurel ended up in this situation; that it was her worry for Quentin that got her captured. When Laurel didn't respond, Diaz teased by calling her baby.

   At the same time Team Arrow and the FBI moved on Diaz's supposed new hideout only to fall right into his trap. As part of the team entered the warehouse, they found out that it had been mined. If they tried to move, they would risk a building explosion. After calling Anatoly and telling him that he'd suffer for his betrayal, Ricardo triggered the bombs remotely. However, Felicity’s intervention helped the heroes avoid death. Immediately after that, the crime lord contacted the mayor again, and agreed to meet him. When Quentin showed up, he revealed that the feds could target Diaz, forcing the man to take him with him to Laurel's hideout. The heroes immediately began tracking Quentin's pacemaker in order to find Diaz's new headquarters.

   Bringing Quentin to Laurel, Diaz threatened to shoot her unless he ordered the FBI to leave Star City. Laurel begged Quentin not to give in, saying Diaz was bluffing. Counting down to five, Diaz fired his gun at Laurel, only for Quentin to take the shot in her place. Diaz tried to bargain with Laurel that if she got her "dad" to meet his demands, he'd show Quentin mercy. Both refused and before the crime lord could kill Laurel, Team Arrow and the FBI busted into his hideout. Seeing Green Arrow, Diaz egged him on before fleeing.

   Diaz escaped to the roof, where he expected transport. There, however, he was cornered by Green Arrow and the two engaged in an armed rematch. Like in their first fight, the Dragon dominated at first but he was eventually overpowered and stabbed with an arrow by the vigilante. Again, the Dragon refused to give up, and defiantly yelled to Green Arrow that to stop him he would have to kill him. Laurel then unexpectedly appeared, and with a sonic scream, launched the Dragon off of the building's roof and into the water.
   When Diaz hit the water, he broke many of his bones causing him to feel constant pain every day from then onwards.

   After Diaz fled, Quentin died in the hospital from the bullet wound he inflected. However, his criminal organization suffered debilitating damage and any influence he had over Star City was completely destroyed, because Green Arrow, during the fight, had taken the pendrive with a list of his wages, removing corrupt policemen, judges, politicians and city officials from Star City. However, Diaz's defeat also had considerable consequences on his enemies, as in addition to Quentin's death, Oliver, honoring the deal he made with the FBI, confessed publicly to being Green Arrow and was sentenced to life in prison. Diaz, still wounded, watched the live transmission furiously as he was already angrily plotting his revenge against Oliver for tearing down the criminal empire he’d worked all his life to build, although he still had resources and connections in the criminal underworld.

   Sometime after his downfall, Diaz reached out to the financial terrorist known as
   Dante

   Diaz met Dante's underling Virgil and grew to fear Dante, believing anyone who betrayed or played him would suffer agonizing torture.

   After five months of recovering with the Longbow Hunters, Diaz hired some prison inmates through Talia who was imprisoned there as well
   to keep Oliver occupied and give him a message saying that Diaz had found and killed Felicity and William. Diaz made it to Felicity's hideout, managing to bypass her security system, and happily referred to her by her alias "Erin". Pulling out a gun, Diaz told Felicity that he planned to let Oliver live in prison knowing he had killed Felicity. Diaz was temporarily distracted when Felicity told William to run and splashed hot coffee on Diaz before tackling him to the ground. Quickly recovering, Diaz easily overpowered Felicity and prepared to kill her, but had to flee when A.R.G.U.S. agents burst into the room in time to save her.

   Sometime after escaping A.R.G.U.S., Diaz had the Longbow Hunters break into an off-site facility of A.R.G.U.S. where they stole prototype B-24, a high densitable renewable battery able to power an entire town. Later, Dragon and two of the
   Longbow
   Hunters
   attempted to raid a train to steal an energy weapon that could be used combined with the B-24. When chased by Diggle, the crime lord attacked him with a flamethrower before getting into a fistfight with him. Although he was wounded by a knife-throw to the shoulder and Diggle had improved his skills, the Dragon was able to nearly beat him again but John managed to knock him down momentarily. Despite a moment of conflict between Diggle’s friends, he managed to retrieve the weapon and escape, leaving Diaz and the two hunters to watch his getaway.

   Diaz and the Longbow Hunters later attempted a break in on
   CDC
   , a secure government facility to steal a bio-compound to heal Diaz's remaining injuries and enhance his strength. Being let in by his mole, Diaz started loading up the chemicals he needed. When Watson, Dinah and Rene tried to stop them, Diaz calmly ordered the two hunters that were with him to handle the three. After retrieving the chemicals he needed, Diaz shot random chemical containers to cover their escape.

   In his hideout, Diaz was mixing the chemical compounds together when the hunters that were with him reported that

But he remained patient. He then injected himself and said he transformed his pain into something else. Getting up, Diaz walked over to a wall and punched it. While the wall was damaged, Diaz's fist was unharmed. He then told them that it transformed into strength.

When the recently escaped Honor walked up and asked if he got what he wanted, Diaz happily answered her question, saying he was going to keep his promise and sarcastically asked the frightened Anatoly if he was right.

  <p key="d0f2a077-962b-4693-ab8b-233e78dc99cf">
   Taking Anatoly back to Star City, Diaz strapped him to a chair and tortured him. Diaz reminded him of the last time they spoke and how Anatoly betrayed their friendship. Anatoly retorted that a man like Diaz has no friends, so he retorted that none of his friends were saving him and that he‘d picked the losing side. Diaz picked up a blowtorch and told Anatoly that he was going to help him destroy Oliver Queen, before burning him. Once Diaz was through torturing Anatoly, he forced him to contact an old associate of his in the
   KGB
   ,
   Pyotr Roslov
   , to purchase two of a weapon called BETAB-500 so he could destroy Star City. Having gotten what he wanted from Anatoly, Diaz and the Longbow Hunters took him to a munition's plant in Orchid Bay and put him in a crate with Honor's belt,
   finding the tracker that Felicity and Laurel planted in it,
   and a bomb to lure Team Arrow to their doom.

   Diaz and the hunters took the BETAB-500s to trigger the explosion to destroy the city. After calling an extraction for them, the Dragon got into yet another battle with Diggle. Diggle managed to disarm him of his flamethrower and his remote trigger, but was as always overpowered by the crime lord. Though Felicity and Curtis were able to stop the countdown, Diaz wasn't concerned. Before he could trigger the explosives manually, the

   Diaz was taken to the SCPD precinct and held in the interrogation room, handcuffed to the table. Felicity walked in and Diaz smugly commented that he liked her better with her pink hair. When Felicity listed all the things Diaz did that ruined her life, Diaz simply asked her what she was going to do in retaliation. In response, Felicity pointed a gun that Anatoly gave her at Diaz. Knowing Felicity didn't have the guts to kill him, Diaz snarkily egged her on to pull the trigger. Laurel then walked in and told her not to shoot. Diaz sarcastically teased Laurel by calling her "baby" saying that she missed him and watched the two ladies talk. Laurel revealed that she made a deal with the FBI that if they hand Diaz over, Oliver will be set free to help them in their case against the Dragon. Diaz, however, remained unfazed by this latest development.

Arriving at Slabside, the officer escorted Diaz out of the van, where two guards mocked him by asking if he knew Oliver was getting out. Diaz remained calm and revealed the officer escorting him was paid off. The officer the killed the two guards and his transport partner while Diaz remained where he was. Diaz then ordered the officer to bring him a change of clothes and to get rid of the bodies.

  <p key="f5cc97d5-bf3c-48ca-919e-608fb8fbfab1">
   In his change of clothes, Diaz paid Oliver a visit. When the inmate arrived at visitation, he was horrified to see Diaz on the other side of the glass. Diaz smugly greeted Oliver and the two began their conversation. When Oliver tried to threaten Diaz, he reminded Oliver that there were innocent people that he could kill if he tried anything. Diaz went on to tell Oliver that he was going to kill him and wasn't concerned as he handled guards like Slabside's growing up. He then pointed out how dehumanizing it is to be called a number and questioned if Oliver ever considered that. When Oliver told Diaz that he was going to die instead of getting locked up, the Dragon remained confident in making Oliver suffer before his death. To push Oliver to the brink, Diaz then told the inmate that after finishing with him, he'd kill Felicity and William. As he figured, Oliver started freaking out and trying to alert the guards that Diaz was here, to no avail. Diaz calmly walked out of visitation and headed to a restricted area of Slabside. He was halted by a Slabside SWAT officer, who he swiftly killed and took his uniform.

   When the prison was put on lock-down after Oliver escaped his cell, Diaz made it to Slabside's outdoor gym, where he began giving a speech comparing himself to the inmates.

   While the inmates tortured the guards in the mess hall, Diaz remained in the control room watching the surveillance cameras. After a while, Diaz planted an explosive to the control room. He then compared Brick's downfall to his because of Oliver to his own. At that moment, Oliver arrived and demanded that Diaz release the guards. He refused and sucker punched Oliver. The former vigilante recovered and told Diaz he‘d spend the rest of his life here. Diaz refused; he promised himself he was never going to die in prison. Turner then arrived and gave Oliver a pillow case with a soda can in it as a weapon. Diaz stood back as Oliver and Turner battled the inmates. When Oliver made it to the control room, the Dragon set off the explosives, causing Slabside to be engulfed in flames. He then left the fallen inmates, including Sampson, to their fates.

He threw Oliver off a balcony to the first floor and stabbed him in the shoulder with Turner's blade. He then proceeded to beat Oliver until they reached his old cell. The crime lord kicked Oliver into his cell and commented on Oliver's stubbornness. He compared his stubbornness to Felicity's and revealed that she attempted to murder him in cold blood, much to Oliver's fury. Diaz then ripped Oliver's picture of Felicity and William in half. Having inadvertently given Oliver time to gather his strength, Diaz was caught off guard and was stabbed by Oliver with Turner's blade.

   During a mission with the Ghost Initiative to catch Dante, Diaz decided to go rogue, warning Dante that it was a trap, while then attempting to kill the A.R.G.U.S. agents present. After being subdued by Oliver, who'd joined A.R.G.U.S. in the mission, Ricardo was sent back to Slabside. Later, while he was in solitary confinement, gasoline was pumped into his cell through the sprinkler system, and

     While originally portraying himself as a brainless thug to his enemies and allies alike, Diaz was actually an extremely intelligent person with his skills in lying and manipulation bordering a machiavellian personality, Diaz was successful in predicting the tactics of Cayden and his
     criminal cabal
     , completely fooling them and successfully pursuing his own agenda,
     Diaz is also an extraordinarily patient person, valuing it as one of life's greatest virtue and notes how it takes a great deal of patience to gain something extraordinary.
     Despite his intellect, he is not above being smug and boastful to others, as he did with Cayden before killing him.
    </p>
    <p key="c8073866-4142-43af-a3a5-244e705d922a">
     Diaz seems to value the concept of "family" viewing the members of his organization as such and was deeply angered when someone "goes against the family",
     whenever Diaz even begins to doubt someone's loyalty, he was immediately hostile, sadistic, and ruthlessly violent to reassert his authority and to immediately intimidate those under his suspicions, even, Laurel Lance, who he demonstrated to be affectionate and even intimate with, violently choked her when he began doubting her loyalty,
     after Laurel testified in favor to protect Oliver, thereby betraying Diaz in favor of

     and ruining his plan that he spent months preparing, he was furiously enraged and later took Laurel hostage.

    <p key="a358a482-d140-4676-97ed-ea6b6e3212a7">
     Similarly, to Anatoly, who Diaz figured out began acting as a mole for Team Arrow, he promises to make Anatoly's death a slow and painful one going so far as to threaten him Russian to do so; a promise that he later try to fulfill,
     according to Laurel, Diaz terrifies her more than

     </a>
     ; albeit in a very twisted and deranged manner.
     For all his talk about family, Diaz actually did not care about anyone but himself as Laurel correctly reaffirms this to the
     Silencer
     that the only person he was loyal to was himself.
    </p>
    <p key="6cfd948a-a3ee-4b38-a10b-7f1b7d40ddcb">
     A possible trait that Diaz acquired from his traumatic upbringing was that due to struggling so much to gain so little food at all, Diaz came to genuinely care about good eating habits as she considers food something that shouldn't be taken for granted; as he scolded Martin Hurst for his tastes in junk food and bring dinner for himself and Laurel,
     Diaz also had a sort of contorted warrior-like philosophy, stating that "fighting for trophies was different than fighting for life" proving that he cares little for competitions in compared to life challenges. Diaz seems to hold some level of respect for the members of his
     organization
     that train and fight with him, granting them money and positions in his organization depending on the skills that they demonstrated to him.
    </p>
    <p key="4cbc1dda-3164-4c25-961b-dfaeabd39657">
     Due to Diaz's psychotic nature or experiencing first-hand how unjust life was, he lacks any form of honor; as he pointlessly hurt a chained Oliver and shamelessly won his bare handed fight against Oliver by using a switch blade to best him thus earning the personal disgust of Anatoly for his dishonorable tactics,
     Diaz also personally despises those who were born with money and privilege such as
     Eric Cartier
     and Oliver, as he had to fight for everything in his life.
     He considered his painful experiences superior to Oliver's, stating that while Oliver spent 5 years in hell, Diaz was born into it.
    </p>
    <p key="e9c73188-e271-4db4-b334-44e7a9679bd8">
     Due to Diaz being treated as a loser as a child, he had a profound amount of rage for anyone who treats him as such, he was openly upset when Eric Cartier talked to him as a superior lashing out by punching a glass mirror, when Eric later revealed that Diaz proposal to the Quadrant was never learned by the organization due to
     Remy Cartier
     , believing Diaz was nothing; Diaz brutally beat him and then used him to kill his father, Remy,
     he was also very vindictive as he had profound ability to feel and act out on personal grudges often turning them into lengthy vendettas to those who he feels have personally wronged or humiliated him. To his childhood tormentor, Jessie, he patiently waited for at least 32 years before cruelly burning Jessie alive.

    <p key="76376d6d-bf53-4a20-8618-63ac213a0f6c">
     While initially seeing Oliver as an obstacle that Diaz had to remove to fully secure his control over Star City, like Jessie, however, he began to personally despise Oliver after the latter with the

     </a>
     's aid successfully defeated him in combat, brought down his organization and publicly humiliated Diaz, forcing him into hiding.
     Afterwards, he wanted to kill Oliver but not before making him suffer for the way Diaz perceives Oliver made him suffer; which he had done by threatening and later attempting to kill Oliver's wife and son,

     Since childhood, Diaz had always been a dramatically failing pretender; for example, he tried very hard to make his father proud of him even if it meant pretending to be someone he wasn't, which never worked, after becoming a crime lord, the life he had, which was filled with nothing but bitterness and rage, made him so determined to finally win that he tried to take over Star City, to prove to the entire criminal underworld that he was a winner, only to once again suffer a far more debilitating failure, as his downfall at the hands of Oliver had instead proven to them that he was nothing more than a loser.
    </p>
    <p key="a2f52451-0709-41fd-b1cb-0aed8f6c3358">
     After Diaz's plan to imprison Oliver failed, he lost his very notable patient nature and began to become increasingly unstable, cruel, erratic and reckless in his actions to the point of carelessness; as he try to kill Oliver,

     and everyone that they cared about,
     he personally executed judge
     C. McGarvey
     , who presided over Oliver's trial who tried to convince Diaz that is was another man (
     Christopher Chance
     ) who freed Oliver,
     during his downfall, Diaz also became more power hunger desiring full leadership of the Quadrant for himself, after Anatoly successfully placed Diaz's treacherous suspicions on
     Lydia Cassamento
     ; he killed her for her apparent betrayal and as his first step to gain control of the Quadrant. He eventually succeeded when he immediately decided to kill
     Dragos Ibanescu
     but spared
     Cyrus Broderick
     after he accepted his leadership.

    <p key="9ae7862b-16c3-4375-bace-2455d750e65f">
     Despite Diaz's intelligent and calculating traits, he was extremely arrogant and egotistical to the point of being delusional, which prevents him from truly learning from his mistakes, as it was one of the contributors to his downfall;
     as Diaz believes that fear and cruelty were enough to get individuals to do what he wants as his reputation as a crime lord made a woman killed her lover then occur Diaz's wrath,
     however, individuals such as Laurel and Anatoly can overcome his intimidation, seeing him for exactly what he was; a petty vindictive psychopath and coward, he also never changes his tactics, as Diaz continued to use fear and extortion, using Laurel as a hostage to get mayor

       Master of deception/Manipulator:
      </b>
      Diaz was an exceptional liar; he was able to fool Cayden for months, as well as the other members of the cabal, including Anatoly and Laurel.
      Diaz was also an exceptional manipulator, as he was able to manipulate Cayden, predicting every move he made and using it to his advantage, such as being able to find out Team Arrow's identities and use them against Cayden. When he learned that Anatoly had betrayed him, Diaz was able to fool Anatoly into believing he was oblivious and utilized the situation to lead Team Arrow and the FBI into a trap.

    However, despite his fearsome aura, should someone know how cowardly Diaz truly was, then he will be unable to intimidate them. After Oliver's victory over him, it seems that while still feared enough by his subordinates to make sure they are still loyal, Diaz lost his grip on the entire criminal underworld.

    Similarly, when Diaz was stabbed with an arrow in the shoulder by Green Arrow during their second fight, he again pulled it out (though still felt a degree of pain) before continuing to fight,
    and didn't showed any pain after he hit the water, which he broke many of his bones causing him to feel constant pain every day from then onwards. Months after his defeat, he pulled a knife from John embedded in his shoulder out without flinching.

    It was later revealed that he suffered hunger as a child and was often forced to fight for getting a meal at the orphanage. This likely made Diaz grow to consider food as a valuable commodity that must not be taken for granted.

    Diaz choosing the name "Dragon" for his internal hatred and fear, and later for himself, as well as his tendency to set things and people on fire, could have been caused by the tortures inflicted on him by
    Jesse Federico
    ; Jesse previously burned Diaz's forearms and in an attempt to stop him from destroying the only picture he had of his late father, Diaz sustained extreme burns and blisters that made his arm resemble a dragon's skin.
