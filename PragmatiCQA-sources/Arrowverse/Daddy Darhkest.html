    John Constantine
   </a>
   is sneaking into the Sumner Asylum. When he's stopped by a nurse he casts a spell on her to make her forget him, and think that everything is perfectly normal. Constantine is there to see a young girl he calls Emily, who he has been trying to help. He starts an exorcism ritual, trying to drive the demon that is possessing her out, but the demon takes over. The demon tells him he's failed, just as he failed
   Astra
   . He tells Constantine that the girl's soul is slipping into the dark, and will soon be being joined by another's:
   Sara Lance
   . Dr. Ellen Moore, wearing a pearl necklace comes in and orders him to leave.

   On the
   Waverider
   , Sara takes John to the bridge and introduces him to some of the Legends (although
   Mick
   initially thinks that John is
   Rip Hunter
   , as they're both skinny Brits wearing trenchcoats). He recognises
   Amaya
   's
   spirit totem
   .
   Nate
   explains that the necklace currently belongs to her
   granddaughter
   , and that Amaya is from 1942. He also tries to chat up
   Leo

   Damien Darhk
   . Ray recalls that the last explosion in the lab cause
   Jax
   and
   Stein
   to switch bodies. Zari admits she misses them too. On the bridge, Constantine is explaining about the exorcism and the demon calling Sara's name, and thinks that if the demon is on first name terms with Sara then perhaps she knows something that will help him save Emily. Sara refuses, saying she is done fighting demons. Nate wonders if this is anything to do with the demon the Legends are fighting. Sara tells Constantine that she recently visited the spirit realm and tells John that the demon's name is
   <a href="Mallus.html" key="c7947885-22e4-41bf-86ee-d4faf6c6c92b" title="Mallus">
    Mallus

   . John tries to leave, but Sara stops him telling him that they've been fighting Mallus since before John knew his name, and that she wants to come along. Constantine refuses but Sara won't take no for an answer. John reluctantly agrees. The Waverider receives a transmission from
   Agent Sharpe
   . She tells Sara that no-one at the
   Time Bureau
   believes Rip about Mallus but she'll keep trying. As she hangs up Leo points out to Sara that Ava was flirting with her.

  <p key="eb4bf203-39e0-45f5-96ed-9ee63cce431a">
   Back at the asylum, Amaya, Sara, Nate, Leo, and John have snuck in to see Emily. Zari is unable to find any mention of her in the admission records. As they're going down a corridor they see see the girl being wheeled away. Sara initially tries to bluff the orderlies into handing over Emily, but decides to knock them out instead. As they're taking Emily somewhere where they can perform an exorcism,
   Kuasa
   appears. Amaya stays behind to delay her. Kuasa says she is there to protect the moment when Emily belongs to the demon. Zari contacts the team to tell them that she's found the girl in the records, but her name isn't Emily – it's
   Nora Darhk
   . After her father was killed by the
   <a href="Oliver Queen.html" key="06582c70-dcdc-4c6c-b07c-7a79836820bd" title="Oliver Queen">
    Green Arrow
   </a>
   she had her name changed and she was placed in Child Protective Services. Nora has been knocked out. Sara tells Nate and Leo to go to the pharmacy to get something to wake her up. They hear Amara and Kuasa fighting outside. Nate goes to help – Leo give him his
   cold gun
   to take with him. Out in the corridor Kuasa is getting the better of Amaya and has broken her arm. Nate manages to freeze Kuasa whilst she's in her water state, and suggests they get her back to the ship before she thaws out. Leo has found the medicine needed to wake Nora up. They've placed Nora in the middle of a mystical emblem that should be able to trap Mallus. They wake Nora up and start the exorcism ritual. Mallus takes over Nora's body again and tells Sara he's been expecting her. Mallus is able to exit the demon trap and throws Sara, Leo, and John across the room, then starts scribbling an incantation on the floor. There is a flash, and the three had vanished. Dr. Moore comes in and asks if she is okay.
  </p>
  <p key="db6704dc-5122-424c-ba34-9c14499083ff">
   The emblem has sent Sara, Leo, and John back in time to the asylum in 1969. They see the a younger version of Dr. Moore (recognisable by her pearl necklace) is working there. They don't have the right equipment to send a message to the Legends, but they notice that the hospital has the same paintings up that were hanging in 2017. They reason that if they write a message in 1969 on the back of a picture that fell of the wall in the future, that their team will see it and know where they are.
  </p>
  <p key="9096c0ac-5a62-4b35-8671-2974bcf00971">
   On the Waverider the rest of the team is trying to decide what to do about the missing Legends and about the still frozen Kuasa. Mick gets tired with them arguing (and interrupting the football game he's watching) and takes command, ordering Zari and Ray to find Sara, Leo, and John (or "Blondie, Fake Snart, and Trenchcoat" as he calls them), Amaya to the medical bay, and Nate to the library, and says that Kuasa stays in the freezer.
  </p>
  <p key="4e2c2e01-2008-4cbc-a9ae-f94f170e872f">
   In 2017 Zari and Ray are in the asylum and see the aftermath of the failed exorcism. Zari takes a photo of the symbol that Nora/Mallus wrote on the floor and works out that their missing shipmates must have been sent through time. Nate and
   Gideon
   start researching where in history they might have been sent to. Meanwhile Zari and Ray go to talk to Nora, but she doesn't know where the missing three went, as it was the demon who cast the spell not her. Zari suggests that they take Nora away from the hospital, where she might have a better chance than there.

  <p key="046267e6-b990-42fe-87ae-4a2fd0dc92f5">
   In 1969 Sara, Leo, and John are heading down to the room where they tried the exorcism in the future when they hear Mallus calling Sara. As they approach the room, John and Leo are frozen, and only Sara can go on. She hears Nora calling to her before a sinister figure tries to burst out of the walls. John catches up to her – Sara is hallucinating. Sara is frightened that Mallus is coming for her. Leo says he will go and put the message behind the painting whilst John stays with Sara. Snart is putting the message behind the picture when an orderly drugs him. Dr. Moore destroys the message and orders that Leo be taken to the operating theatre. Sara meanwhile is still seeing things, with Mallus trying to use her darkest emotions to make her susceptible to possession. John is able to cast a spell to drive Mallus away. As they're resting, Sara tells Constantine that she thought she was done with all the fighting for her soul. John tells her, as one who's damned his own soul to hell, that it's never done. He reminds Sara that she is tough enough to fight off even the strongest demon. The two make love.

   On the Waverider Amaya thaws out Kuasa, who calls her "Nana Baa" (Grandmother). Amaya says it's strange to be called that, and says that time travel can be maddening. Kuasa agrees – especially if you have the means to change things but you don't. Amaya tells her that she cannot change the timeline. Kuasa calls her a coward, and tells her that men came to their village, murdered (an older) Amaya, and burnt it to the ground. Her mother was able to escape with her sister Mari, but Kuasa believes that her mother abandoned her. Amaya tells her that her mother thought she was dead. Kuasa tells her that she has made a deal with Damien Darhk to save her village – and her Grandmother.

   Back in 1969 Dr. Moore is about to give Leo a lobotomy when Sara and John come in and rescue him. The doctor attacks them and is knocked out. Snart tells them that they found the note and that they'll have to find another way out of 1969. Sara suggest using the time travel spell that Nora used. Constantine says he isn't powerful enough to cast it. Sara suggests casting Mallus in to her, and using his power to create the spell. John asks what happens when she's possessed. Sara reminds him that he said she was strong enough to hold Mallus off. Constantine admits he only said that to try and seduce her.

   In 2017 Zari and Ray have managed to break Nora out of the asylum and have take her to the
   SC Jitters
   coffee shop. Whilst there Nora sees a news report on the television of Oliver Queen's trial, during which they show footage of the death of her father. Mallus takes over Nora's body and wrecks the coffee shop.
  </p>
  <p key="f8f0868e-87ab-40fe-87e4-b97f7fd9a992">
   On the Waverider Amaya has told Kuasa about her vision quest, and how her
   ancestor
   told her to protect the new totem bearer. She says that she thought it referred to Zari, but now thinks that it might refer to Kuasa. Nate comes into the cell to rescue Amaya but is knocked out by Kuasa.
  </p>
  <p key="03811377-7b79-4694-8788-38ffc9f6da25">
   In 1969 Sara and Constantine are preparing to summon Mallus. John performs the spell and Sara finds herself in
   Mallus's realm
   . She starts to draw the time travel sign on the ground of the demon realm, and in the real world it also appears on the floor. In the demon world Sara hears a child crying. She goes to see who it is and finds Nora's spirit.

  <p key="16667527-77bf-401d-80df-1c10eb7ed3e3">
   In 2017 Mallus has managed to pin Nate against the wall. Zari tries to take Nora/Mallus's arm and it burns him. He says that she is one of the six and levitates broken glass, intending to kill Zari.

  <p key="47c22aa5-9388-4d0a-b541-146ad07b73e9">
   In Mallus's world, Sara tells Nora that she has a choice – give in to the darkness or fight it. Nora chooses to fight, and in 2017 Mallus is banished from Nora's body. Sara is able to finish the time travel emblem in the demon world, and in 1969, it glows. John and Leo grab Sara's body and they all travel back to the asylum in 2017.

  <p key="a204046e-bc1f-42fa-a3f1-c1077a72ce63">
   On the Waverider Kuasa is drowning Nate. Amaya asks her to release him, saying he can help Amaya save Kuasa so that she can go home. Amaya lets Kuasa go.

  <p key="5821fc93-5773-4831-aa18-f280f6cb7760">
   In the coffee shop in 2017, Nora apologises for everything. Zari and Ray tell her that they know it wasn't her fault, and that they are going to find a home where she can be safe. Damien Darhk appears behind them. Nora is overjoyed to see him, and tells than that Zari and Ray have kept her safe, but Damien says that they were lying to her, and were afraid of who she is. He tells her that Mallus isn't a demon, he's her saviour, and that one day she will use Mallus's power to bring him back. He tells her that he's found her a home where they understand her power. The older Dr. Moore enters, and tells her that the
   Order of the Shrouded Compass
   will help her to bring Damien back for good, and they take Nora away.
  </p>
  <p key="5dbf2938-24c6-4b68-a22d-645d1ee4aa13">
   On the Waverider, Zari tells the rest of the Legends about how Mallus seemed afraid of her totem. John thinks the totems might be the key to defeating Mallus, but Amaya says that she only knows of 5 totems – spirit,
   earth
   ,
   air
   ,
   fire
   , and
   water
   , and wonders if there could be more that they don't know about. Constantine says he will do some research and takes his leave. He asks Ray to help him with the cargo bay door. In the cargo bay he asks about the anti-magic gun he is working on. Ray was planning to put it into storage, by Constantine tells him to keep it nearby. He tells Ray that Sara has the demon's power inside her now, and they might need the anti-magic gun if, or more likely, when she succumbs to it.
