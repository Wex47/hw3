   In January 2016, Mick and Snart were recruited by

   into the
   Legends
   , a time-traveling team of superheroes dedicated to hunting down

   and preventing his uprising in 2166. Considered "supervillains" in comparison to the rest of their team, Mick and Snart were seen as outcasts. Though both initially joined to exploit the potentials of time travel Snart came to be genuine about the cause whereas Mick did not, leading to a falling out between them when Mick betrayed the team to time pirates for his own safety. As a result, Snart was forced to maroon Mick in an unknown time period, but he was found by the Time Masters and brainwashed into becoming a temporal bounty hunter named

   . Under this guise Mick traveled back in time and hunted down his old team during their initial ventures through time, but was eventually exposed and captured by the Legends who reformed him. Mick continued to be a reluctant member of the team after becoming a target of the Time Masters for his failure. After Snart's sacrifice to save him and end the corrupted Time Masters, Mick finally became genuine about the cause too. After aiding in Savage's death Mick decided to remain on the team.

   . Recently Mick has begun to display amicable affections for fellow team member and JSA war hero
   Amaya Jiwe/Vixen

   At a young age, Mick developed a fascination and obsession with fire. At some point he started a criminal career and went to juvenile detention.

   At some point Mick started an obsession with

   In 1986, while at juvie, he met 14-year-old
   Leonard Snart

   In 1989, Mick graduated from
   Central City High School
   . Despite still being in juvie at the time of its senior prom, he was originally going to break out and attend it with
   Ali
   , a girl from his class that he had previously been exchanging letters with, as his date. However, he cancelled it and ended up not going.

   In 1990, he accidentally set his house on fire and rushed to safety without warning his parents, which led to them being killed. At a safe distance, Mick watched in horror of what he did and fascination of the flames, but was soon approached by the
   The Pilgrim
   , who sought to kill him. However,

   , claiming to work for a secret organization called
   A.R.G.U.S.
   . Mick was kept in the cargo bay and soon joined by a 19-year-old
   Sara Lance
   from 2007. He attempted to flirt with her, only to be slapped in the face. Sara's future self from 2016 came to discipline them. Later, Mick and Sara tried to find a way out but were stopped by Mick's older self from 2016. He and Sara were then placed in charge of a baby
   Leonard Snart
   from 1972.

   Mick, Sara, Leonard, and the other younger versions of the Legends were later relocated to
   The Refuge
   under
   Mary Xavier
   's care. While there, Mick started to play with his matches but was scolded by his older self for being reckless and getting his family killed, and threatened to kill him if he tried anything foolish. However, younger Mick noted that he sounded just like
   their father
   , causing the older Mick some discomfort. Later, Mick's older self apologized for his earlier outburst, accepting that what they did was an accident. Mick was advised by his older self to be better than him.

   After the The Pilgrim was defeated,
   Rip Hunter
   returned Mick and the other younger members of the Legends to the timeline. Mick was presumably given an amnesia pill to erase his memory of what happened and keep his future intact.

   Later that year, Snart gave him a handheld flamethrower and offered to work a few more jobs with him in
   Central City
   . Mick, pleased at the offer and the
   Heat gun

   Snart had Mick learn how to fix up the flamethrower when needed, which proved handy.

   The two men began by crashing through a frozen door in to a building. Snart had hoped to wait for

   When the police arrived, Snart attempted to use his cold gun to freeze them, though it was no match against their specially-made shields. Instead, Mick showed himself, instead using his handheld flamethrower to burn them. He was momentarily mesmerized by the flames, but he was stopped when

    Detective West

   shot through his gun from afar. They returned to their base, where Mick began fixing the minor damage. Snart quickly approached him with his gun pointed towards him, arguing that his obsession with fire would get the better of him, as with their previous job. Mick in turn pointed his flamethrower back, rebutting that Leonard was just as obsessed, but with precision on their heists. Mick wished to simply stop at the painting, but Snart wished to further kill The Flash. He reasoned with Mick, who decided to burn

   Realizing that The Flash had partners, they tracked down
   Caitlin Snow
   . They took her to their hideout and recorded an ultimatum for The Flash, asking him to come to a location at sundown. Mick tied up Caitlin, who remarked upon his third-degree burns over his body. He claimed to have had fire reveal his "true self". He wanted to uncover her true self, but was stopped by Snart, who planned to leave. Mick gagged Caitlin and placed a bomb attached to a tripwire under her seat. At the crossroads of their meeting with The Flash, they began shooting, missing him almost every time. However, they were able to hit him, knocking him down. Before he could be killed,
   Detective Eddie Thawne
   intervened with an element-proof shield. The Flash rushed him to safety and returned, deciding to take the blasts. He led the two beams towards each other, cancelling each other out and knocking the men away from The Flash. From there, they were arrested and taken back to the
   Central City Police Department
   . Mick attempted to escape, but was held back. They were soon on their way to

   When Snart decided to take a more firm hand in Central City, he and Mick Rory decided to try and target one of the major crime families. In an alternate turn of events when Barry Allen had stopped the Weather Wizard by going back in time, it led to Rory and Snart taking out one of the heads of the Central City mob and took up residence in his house. They then realized that they needed to get their guns back so they used

   to lure Cisco back to the house. Rory went off and kidnapped his brother
   Dante Ramon
   and Cisco was forced to cooperate. He then went on to not only re-make the Heat and Cold Guns but also make a new gun for Lisa Snart that fired and cocooned its targets in solid gold. When the Ramon brothers tried to escape, Rory went on to punish Dante in front of Cisco before Snart told him to back off. Later, he went with Snart and his sister to hit a money shipment but they were thwarted by the Flash who had taken Snart. However, he was forced to let them all go as now Snart knew the Flash's true identity and would leak it out if he took them in.

Jax went on to tell his younger self that they were with

He saw that his younger self was watching the flame and he told him that it was beautiful but pointedly told him that it wasn't as beautiful as a whole house catching on fire with a family still inside. His younger self angrily countered that he didn't want to kill his family but Mick said that he loved fire so much that he played with their father's lighter fluid and found he couldn't control the fire so he ran and saved his own skin. Mick then told his younger self that if anything happened to this place, if it caught on fire then he would find him.

Mick and the others fought against the Pilgrim when they set a trap to trade Rip's younger self for their loved ones. He was frozen in time by the Pilgrim's powers but when young Rip managed to stab her, her hold on them broke and their combined attacks reduced her to ash. Mick then returned to find his younger self trying to hurt himself with a lit match and he told him that it wouldn't make the pain of losing their family go away. He then revealed to him that he was his future self and he finally forgives him for what happened that night with their family. He then tried to tell his younger self to try hard to not be him.

However, Mick told him that the gun wasn't the problem; it was Ray's inability to access his inner darkness. Once he could do that, wielding the gun would be easy; Mick was then left impressed with Ray's response of threatening to ice him if he called him "Haircut" again.

   Going to the White House in the 1980s, the team was to subdue
   Damien Darhk
   , who was attempting to sabotage president Reagan's attempt to disarm both the US and Russia's nuclear weapons for the sake of his
   Genesis
   plan. During the White House tour, Mick encouraged Ray to steal jelly beans kept for the president; when offered some, Mick happily accepted. However, when it came to fighting off the Secret Service, Ray ignored Mick's warnings to not cross the streams, knocking them both back. In the end, MIck realized that he couldn't force Ray to be Snart, telling him to be himself. This helped Ray with disarming a bomb Darhk had left.

   Turnbull Country

Hex told them that the Turnbull gang had gotten access to new ammunition, which was more powerful than what should be available in the 1800s. It turned out that a time pirate was tracing a large deposit of

   Mick was tasked with getting Turnbull to divulge information, but instead got along with him due to being a fellow outlaw; he even shared some funny stories about his failed crimes with him. Amaya was forced to step in, and get him to leave. Getting scolded for not following the plan, Mick told her that he was just a beast that liked to watch the world burn.The team later prevented Turnbull from sealing off the West, getting Ray new material to rebuild his
   ATOM Exosuit

   Leonard Snart

  <p key="449dc343-2403-477f-8c80-a86dfbd15051">
   Mick spent a good amount of time trying to get Snart out of his head, drinking numerous bottles. He was caught by Stein, who he confided in about his hallucinations; however, he threatened him into keeping it quiet from the rest of the team as he feared they would react badly. Stein tried explaining that Snart was likely an image that Mick's inner voice choice to talk sense into him; Mick believed Snart was possibly stuck in a place in time after the Oculus was destroyed and trying to reach him. Stein said it was possible, but not very likely. Once the team found Rip in 1967, Mick learned Rip's mind had been altered by touching the time drive; Rip now believed he was Phil Gasmer, an American filmmaker.

  <p key="55db5b83-5150-4ac8-98db-183f1eef7937">
   Mick demanded Stein use the scanner device on his head, having a hallucination of Snart immediately afterwards. Mick told Stein exactly what the hallucination said, asking Stein to operate on his brain. Stein complied, taking out a chip the Time Master put in during his time as Chronos. Recovering, Mick was relieved that he wasn't seeing Snart for the moment, but Stein told him the chip wasn't responsible as it burned out a long time ago. Stein explained that it was likely Mick had accumulated too many head injuries in the past.

   When Stein told the team that his daughter
   Lily
   was a time aberration he didn't think that was a problem. When Stein asked the team to not tell Lily the truth, he gave Rory a pointed look which he was offended at.

   George Washington
   , Rory wasn't that torn up about it as he felt Washington was a punk and not that great a president as he was only on the one dollar bill. He went undercover as an American soldier and tried to cover Washington with Sara when redcoats attacked them with automatic rifles. An EMP then went and disabled his heat gun. They ran into Rip Hunter where he went and shot Sara and commanded the British to take Rory and Washington away. As they were being led away, Rory promised to strangle Rip the next time he saw him and ate sloppily as they were being taken off to the British camp.

   When they were there, they ran into
   General Cornwallis

Washington argued that Rory was only a soldier following orders and didn't deserve to die though Rory happily argued otherwise. Washington prepared a letter to his wife that he wanted Rory to see was delivered but he refused as he said that Washington should give it to her himself. He said that they should resist with everything they had because the enemy wanted to kill them anyway. Washington argued that went against being a gentleman and an American. Rory told him that being an American meant being a misfit and rebel and to be damn proud of it.

   When Washington was going to be hung, he made a point to distract the British giving Rory an opening to take a musket and ignite a cache of gunpowder. This distraction gave Washington time to escape the noose and together the two of them took on the British in the camp. They were soon surrounded but Nate and Amaya arrived to help them escape. Later, Washington took Rory aside and told him that he was impressed with his rebel spirit. He told Rory that he was a prime example of what it meant to be an American which Rory was left a little touched by and he changed his mind and saw that Washington was a great president after all. Rory then handed the letter back to him but Washington revealed that it had actually been a battle strategy for a sneak attack that he wanted to make it back to the army which Rory was proud of Washington for. When the team returned to the Temporal Zone they saw history was back on track but there was now a statue in D.C. that resembled Rory.

They then located another fragment in 507 A.D. but Mick chose to stay on the Waverider than visit medieval times. He stumbled upon Stein who had also stayed on the ship and saw that he had stolen future tech from 3000 A.D. which Mick found himself being impressed by. It turned out to be a mind control device and when it was being used by the Legion, Stein and Jax tested it out on Mick but it didn't work. When the team had found the fragment guarded by
   Stargirl

   Camelot

The team decided to stay and Mick and Stein moved to try and hack the mind control tech again but Jax had Mick be the controller this time and found that the key wasn't intelligence but intensity. Mick's intensity managed to make the tech work and they used him to override the Legion's control of the knights they were using it on. Mick later tried to get Stein to admit that his brain saved the day but Stein said he would admit no such thing.

   The Legends managed to capture Rip but he had taken control of the ship and was trying to make his escape. Rory moved with Amaya and Nate to stop him and Rip destroyed the medallion in front of them before Rory went and knocked him out. He then had an idea to go into Rip's mind in the same manner that the time masters went into his mind when he was Chronos. Mick stayed in the med bay with Stein while they oversaw as Sara and Jax entered Rip's mind to free him of the Legion's brainwashing. Stein was getting more on edge the longer they were in Rip's mind, especially with Jax but Mick told him that his pacing and frantic worrying wasn't helping. Mick encouraged Stein to treat Jax more like a partner than an assistant, stating Stein's only got so many years left in him and Jax had to learn to do and handle things himself. When Rip was brought back to normal, Mick greeted him with a joke "I liked you better when you were killing people."

   When Rip told them that

They reviewed history and found that Henry Heywood had become a mission supervisor for NASA during the Apollo-13 shuttle launch in 1970. When they found Heywood, he helped Rory, Stein and Jax infiltrate mission command as officers from the British Space Program and he pretended to be a man of few words. He stayed with Stein in mission control to try and buy time so that NASA didn't stumble on the team infiltrating the shuttle or seeing any of them while they were dealing with Eobard Thawne or retrieving the spear fragment from the moon. They managed to distract NASA and cut their feed but heard that the Waverider was damaged and the team would have a hard time returning home. They also found out that
   Hank Heywood

   When the Legends ultimately got to the London branch of

   To show her respect for what the Legends had said, when Clotho helped to create
   Loomworld

He views his burns as revealing the truth of who he really is, and as such, he has embraced this self-determined truth of who he is: A man who burns the world to reveal its own inner nature as it did to him. This is an unusual trait, but does show that he is much more than the image of the unstable pyromaniac that he projects himself as.

    In spite of Mick's nature, he still has a code of honor, even though he initially claimed to Ray Palmer that his only loyalty is to
    Leonard Snart
    . During the rescue mission from the Russian gulag, Mick refused to abandon Ray, despite Leonard's insistence to leave him behind after Ray insulted the interrogator's mother and took a beating in order to keep Mick from being tortured further. However, it appears that any shred of loyalty and honor he has regarding
    Rip Hunter
    's
    team
    was gone when he learned that Rip only recruited him to the team to sway Leonard into joining and viewed him simply as a dumb psychopathic arsonist, causing Mick to betray Rip to the time pirates to give up the

    As he was left in an unknown time, he became wild, eating raw animals until the Time Masters found him, brought him to the Vanishing Point. As he lost himself from being in an alien time for too long, they manipulated and trained him as a bounty hunter and assassin over what he described as "lifetimes" and "being reborn". He returned with extensive knowledge of temporal physics, Time Master protocols and futuristic weapons and technology, on par with that of
    Rip Hunter
    . However, despite his knowledge, he was still bent on avenging himself against the team and Snart. He threatened to kill Lisa Snart over and over by time traveling, as well as forcing Leonard to watch each time. However, he later returned to his old self while back on the

    and became a member of the team once more. He also became more emotionally reflective, forgiving himself for accidentally setting fire to his house and killing his family. He also seemed to forgive Snart and the team, becoming more friendly towards them. Also, after Snart sacrificed his life for Mick, it appeared to have a profound affect on him; while still committing thefts, he began going about it more cautiously and tried to avoid killing innocent bystanders. His respect for Snart was great enough for him to head back to 2013, where he told past Snart he considered him his personal hero.

     Once he rejoined the Legends, Mick largely seemed more mature, but retained his snarky, gruff demeanor. He ironically seemed to listen to Rip more than the others, as he left his Heat Gun behind when ordered, so to avoid damaging the timeline. During his time travels, he's developed a bond with his team, willing to save them as they would return the favor for him, to the extent that he assisted Nate Heywood in retrieving the rest of the team from across history after being discovered in stasis in 2016 when he could have easily just taken the

     and gone off on his own. Even his threats towards his teammates became more playful and less violent and more comical, such as threatening to shave Ray Palmer's head if he told anyone about his compassionate side, which is a far cry from his former tendency of threatening to kill people even if they were his allies. This subtle change marks this profound evolution in his personality. While he still identifies himself as a criminal when talking to the
     Justice Society of America
     , the rest of the Legends all acted in his defense when he was accused of killing Hourman, and Rory was even the one to voice the other heroes' refusal to allow the Flash to turn himself over to the
     Dominators
     to save the world despite admitting that he disliked the other man.

     After being infected and turned into a zombie, Mick begged and trusted Ray to cure him, showing a deepening sense of camaraderie between the two. In the aftermath of his zombification, Mick assuaged Ray's fears that without his suit that he might no longer have a place on the team. Mick reminded him that being an outsider isn't so bad, and gave Ray the Cold Gun, Mick's only memento of Leonard Snart, his best friend. This was given with the claim that Mick was looking for a new partner, and trusted Ray enough to give him that chance. When Stein continued babying Jax, Mick bluntly told him to treat Jax like a partner rather than as a child; Stein only has a so many years left of life, so it's best to teach Jax all he can. He later showed some interest in
     Amaya Jiwe

     Following Snart's self-sacrifice, Rory struggles to honor his dead friend. Initially he believed staying part of the Legends is what Snart would want but his own self-doubt as a part of the team, being both hero and criminal and how much his friends truly valued him manifested in a hallucination of Snart's criminal life. His loneliness was such that Rory even tried to replace Snart by giving Ray the cold gun and making him act more like his dead friend until he passively accepts that Leonard was gone and Ray should be himself. However, when the Legends went to steal Christ's Blood to destroy the Spear of Destiny, the Legion of Doom plucked a time remnant of Snart from before joining the Legends. Mick's survival attitude strongly leads him to believe that caring for the rest of the team will eventually cause his death the same way it did Snart (perhaps a reaction due to losing his only family at a young age) and Leonard taunts that the Legends consider him an unchanged criminal and lapdog rather than an equal teammate. This was cause enough for Mick to eventually hand over the Spear of Destiny to the Legion of Doom so they can rewrite reality. However, in the "Doomworld" Rory begins to realize his mistake as things became increasingly different with reality and Snart, insinuating he respected the man Leonard became because of his loyalty and heroism which was reciprocated in the other Legends rather than who he was. Furthermore, he realizes his partner's hypocrisy that despite his previous claims about being a pet, Snart was similarly obedient to Thawne and Darhk and how he was treating Rory like a pet rather than a partner. Realizing that the Snart he knew was long dead, Mick has gained closure over realizing that the Legends made him and his friend a better person so he rejoins them. He has developed a new liking to
     Killer Frost

     Mick has various fears, obsessions and quirks that seem to border on the irrational. Aside from a fear of clowns and giant toads which he divulged to
     Martin Stein
     during the
     Legends
     ' time in
     Hollywood
     .
     and a hatred of puppets.
     He's also implied to be afraid of clowns.
     Mick also possesses a fixation with vampires to the point where he's carried a wooden stake on his person for his entire life, as mentioned when the Legends traveled to 1895 London, seemingly dealing with a time-displaced vampire. On this mission, Mick was also shown wearing garlic around his neck as a means to repel vampires.

     Much to the surprise of outsiders (some who even consider him illiterate) Mick has also been shown to have a liking towards writing, as he was recently revealed to be writing a sci-fi romance novel.
     He also seems to enjoy reading, as he was seen reading

     Ironically, despite his pyromania Mick has an interest towards Killer Frost. Presumably he already showed an attraction to her alter-ego Caitlin Snow and this was simply amplified upon the realisation of her own dark side that he observed as she fought off the Nazis of Earth-X.

    <p key="8a2fa546-7946-434c-805e-d1ebf57af0b7">
     Another interesting trait of Mick is that despite initially being a criminal and wanted to stay to rule over one of the gang ruled futures, he doesn't seem to desire power or at least has no qualms about giving it up, as he did when he gave up the fire totem without reluctance. The fire totem being an artifact that allowed the pyromaniac Mick to do anything he wanted with fire. While initially hyperactive and more engaging in activities, after Snart's death, Mick become an alcoholic and was usually content to stay on the Waverider watching movies. During one of these moments, Mick displayed some surprising leadership skills when he assigned tasks to the other Legends, if only to get them to leave him watch TV in peace.

    Since accidentally fathering Lita, Mick has taken it upon himself to esnure she turns out better than himself.

    While at times seen as deranged or barbaric, Mick has a remarkable fortitude, unyielding to seemingly any form of torture, at times even seeming to revel in it. Mick was said to have survived severe burns from a heist with Snart that went wrong.
    Even the
    Time Masters
    admitting their brainwashing of Mick into Chronos the first time was only a partial success.
    The intensity of Mick's mind was shown to be able to overwhelm even the mind-control network the

    Mick has also grown accustomed to time jumps, often not feeling any of the side-effects (although as Rip has stated the larger the time jump, the more likely it is for side-effects to occur, even for experienced time travelers). Mick also has a high tolerance for alcohol, as he declared to Fredric that "No one out-drinks Mick Rory."
