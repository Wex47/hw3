     , but to a much greater degree. She is tough and not afraid to use force or violence to get what she wants. When she first met William and
     Zoe Ramirez
     , she was nothing but aggressive and distant, displaying no sign of interest or respect in what they had to say.
      She can also be quite stubborn and single-minded, which has led her to make rash decisions.
      This is likely due to her not being able to trust others easily after feeling betrayed by her own mother.
      After mending fences with Felicity, Mia had begun to show more compassion and consideration for her teammates, particularly with William.

     When Zoe died, Mia's anger for her comrade's death overwhelmed her to the point of wanting to kill Grant Wilson despite the fact that said criminal was different from the one that killed Zoe. In her moment of deep anger, she soon escalated from trying to avoid her father, Oliver from displaying great rage and even threatening to kill him if he continued to stood in her way.

     But after Mia got to spend some time with her father, Oliver in the past, she was more understanding of why her father did what he does.

    After Oliver gave her a suit and suggested she should become the next Green Arrow, Mia fought in the
