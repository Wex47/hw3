   The group operated from a base of operations that they set up in the

   . However, the Legends later traveled back in time and succeeded in erasing the Spear of Destiny from existence, leading to Eobard's death and Darhk, Snart, and Merlyn all being returned to their respective times.

   implied that his plan to find the
   Spear of Destiny
   was altered multiple times, due to
   Rex Tyler
   catching on his plans and coming to warn the
   Legends

   Amaya Jiwe
   to join the Legends.
   To correct past mistakes, Thawne's new plan included the creation of an organization with power and resources beyond his own. Choosing people who'd like to correct their destinies, Eobard found
   Damien Darhk

   Al Capone's criminal empire
   into submission, making use of
   Al Capone
   's goons.
   While he couldn't command the
   Nazis
   , he'd manipulate them to do his bidding with the promise of
   his biomolecular enhancer
   , and also extended influence over the British Army during the Revolutionary War by placing
   Rip Hunter
   , whose mind was altered to make him an ally of the Legion, as a new colonel that supplied
   England
   with weapons from centuries in the future, specifically assault rifles.
   Rip Hunter proved quite resourceful, acquiring the mind-control technology from the year 3000 after murdering
   Dr. Mid-Nite
   , which allowed him and Damien Darhk to take over King
   Arthur
   and his best knights, crafting a "Dark Army" for their use, with Darhk posing as "the Dark Knight" and Rip as the "Devilish Sorcerer".

   Needing the "

   " to further their goals, the three decided to create a time aberration, to trap the Legends, by allying with crime lord
   Al Capone
   in 1927. Although Capone threatened to have the time travelers killed, after Eobard personally took down his goons before finishing a single sentence, the gangster was subdued. The Legion then entered into an alliance and gained the services of
   Al Capone's criminal empire
   . Telling Capone that he was going to be hunted down by the Prohibition agent
   Eliot Ness
   , Eobard had both the gangster and the
   Legends
   take bait, causing a minor aberration that would let Capone become a mayor of
   Chicago

   As the Legends searched one club for clues on Capone's businesses, Eobard kidnapped Sara Lance and Martin Stein. Merlyn came to sway the kidnapped Sara and Martin with promises of changing the timeline for the better together, and once he was unsuccessful, Darhk came with the threats of torture, taking Martin Stein with him and his goons to force Sara to sway under threats. Thawne then used his modified
   appearance-stealing cord

In the guise of Professor Stein, he searched for the missing artifact but was interrupted by Sara Lance, forcing him to come to a halt. After realizing that
   Nate Heywood
   was aware that he isn't the real Martin, Eobard abandoned his disguise and ran off, but was struck by a speedster weapon, temporarily subduing him. However, Thawne immediately regained strength and threatened to kill

   Amaya Jiwe
   was only on the team to avenge him for killing

   , taunting her. With Amaya briefly distraught, Eobard sped off. Meanwhile,
   Sara Lance
   fought Malcolm at the bridge and eventually got the upper hand. Before Sara could kill Malcolm, the latter offered Stein's location in return for the

   Using the medallion, Darhk and Merlyn found themselves in Hollywood in the year 1967. The two of them killed two motorists, one who was supposed to go on and create a new engine, thus creating an aberration which summoned the Legends. They tracked down Rip Hunter who was going by the name Phil Gasmer and was now a movie director. The two recognized him though found that Rip didn't seem to know who they were or who he really was. The Legends arrived and saw them with Rip and moved to stop them but ended up having to retreat when the police arrived.

   The duo questioned the film crew and learned that
   George Lucas
   had the piece of the spear that they were looking for. They surprised Nate, Ray and Amaya, who were also looking for Lucas, and held them at gunpoint. Lucas told them that he thought the spear was a prop and was junk so he threw it in the trash. Darhk then threatened Lucas to show them where the city dump was. They had their four prisoners go and dig through the trash to find the spear but took the time to activate the trash compactor to motivate them to look faster. Lucas had been scared into quitting film school, creating an aberration which removed Nate's powers and Ray's suit from existence but when he admitted that what he really wanted to do was direct, the two were returned.
  </p>
  <p key="73d4805e-6418-4e1e-88ee-cc8787557da8">
   Using them, they were able to escape the compactor and fight back against Darhk and Merlyn. The rest of the team arrived and were able to get both the spear and the amulet from them. Darhk and Merlyn were overwhelmed by the Legends until Thawne showed up and leveled the playing field. Darhk and Merlyn wondered where Thawne had been and he simply shrugged to them that he had a prior engagement. Rip Hunter showed up and tried to help the Legends by pretending to have his old memories back but the act didn't stick. When the Legion prepared to attack, Rip called for the
   <i key="33cf0464-8639-457e-984a-508ea4f810e8">

  <p key="1bfeaaf3-6bd5-424c-8d58-8ab395fa8b8b">
   Rip, now a prisoner of the Legion, was confronted by Thawne. Rip tried to explain that he didn't know anything and that he wasn't who everyone seemed to believe he was, that he was 'Phil' but Thawne wasn't moved. When he saw the tools for torture, Rip asked Thawne if he was going to torture him. Thawne told him that he wasn't going to, but that Darhk and Merlyn would.
   Damien and Malcolm tortured 'Phil', but he wasn't able to tell them the location of the Spear. The two argued with Eobard when he blamed them for losing the Amulet and then threatened to kill them. Malcolm tried hypnotizing Rip, but failed, though he did discover that Hunter's memories truly were gone. Eobard expressed frustration with them and sped away. Damien then tried his hand at torturing Rip on his own, and pulled out one of Rip's teeth, which contained account information for a safety deposit box in Switzerland with Rip's memories inside it. Eobard ordered the two to retrieve it and again left.

  <p key="c673e056-ec2b-487e-9129-e95bf7932edf">
   While Merlyn and Darhk prepared to leave, they argued about how to approach the problem. Malcolm convinced Damien to bring Rip along and have him retrieve the box for them, and the three left for Switzerland. They infiltrated the box and Rip went to go get the box from the vault. While he was doing so, Damien and Malcolm discussed what Eobard was planning and why he even needed the two of them. Damien assumed that Merlyn was attempting to manipulate him, but they were interrupted by Rip failing to gain access to the vault. When the bank teller called security, the two intervened and killed the guards before escaping the bank with Rip.

   Back at their base, the two men once again argued, which led to a League-style sword fight. However, Rip convinced them to stop dueling and find a way to even the odds against Eobard. They went back to the bank, leaving Rip tied up. Eobard returned to the base and Rip informed him of where they had gone. Thawne confronted them in the vault, where they had retrieved a disk containing Rip's memories. Malcolm and Damien then locked the vault, trapping Eobard inside with them. Eobard threatened to kill them if they didn't let him out, slowly becoming more and more desperate, to his partners' puzzlement.

Malcolm and Damien agreed to help Eobard fend off the demon, as long as he agreed to make them equal partners in their team. Eobard reluctantly agreed, and when Hunter entered the bank to find Eobard, Malcolm and Damien managed to distract Hunter long enough for Eobard to throw him into the vault, locking the door and trapping it within. Eobard thanked them and honored his deal and the three left, knowing Hunter wouldn't remain trapped for long.

   His attack on Washington caused an aberration to lure the Legends. Eobard gave Rip the mission to use the British army in order to acquire their piece of the spear. They gave the British automatic rifles which they used to try to attack Washington before the Legends could try and save him. Rip then used an EMP device to disable the

He found and held Sara's life hostage and demanded Jax give him the spear and Jax told him it was hidden in his telescope in the study. He then went and killed Sara in front of him. Rip then went and got the spear but before he could leave Jax held a pistol on him but before he could shoot, Sara emerged as Gideon had been able to save her in time.

   Rip Hunter informed the Legion that the spear was split into four parts, three of which he gave to
   Dr. Mid-Nite

At first, Rip passed himself off as an old friend and told him that the spear needed to be reunited but Dr. Mid-Nite wasn't falling for the ruse. Rip then preceded to kill him and take the fragment which he had surgically put into his own body. He then went and took mind control technology that the doctor was working on.

   Afterwards, Rip and Damien Darhk went to the time of Camelot and
   King Arthur

Eventually, he managed to capture the legendary king himself and used him to gain access into the castle using the mind control tech that Rip stole from Dr. Mid-Nite. He and Rip found that the Legends were there and demanded that Stargirl give the fragment of the spear to them but she refused. A fight broke out and saw Sir Galahad killed and Rip threatened to have Arthur kill himself. Darhk gave them an ultimatum: Deliver the spear's fragment at dawn or they will use an army under mind control to attack.

Darhk left him behind to try escaping but Ray went after him. Darhk told Ray he wasn't any knight but a glorified nerd and the two fought. Ray managed to disarm Darhk when his ionic charged sword managed to destroy Damien's. Darhk pretended to submit before he went and pulled out a blaster and shot Ray before he made his escape, leaving the fragment of the spear to Legends. Rip was taken to the

He then managed to steal the medallion but Nate, Amaya and Mick managed to intercept him before he could make it to the jumpship. He saw that he wouldn't be able to escape so he destroyed the amulet to keep the Legends from finding the last fragment. Mick then knocked him out and Jax managed to reboot Gideon and keep her from completing the self-destruct. Sara and Jax used some mental technology from the Time Masters to go into Rip's mind to undo the programming that Eobard did and bring Rip back to his old self. They succeeded and Rip Hunter returned to normal. He then revealed that he knew where the last fragment was that was being guarded by Commander Steel.

As they were fixing the shuttle, Thawne told Ray that it was nice to actually work with another scientist again as he hadn't since Cisco and Caitlin. He also told him that they weren't too different from one another. Ray said that they were nothing alike as Thawne was a monster that killed Barry's mother twice, Rex Tyler and brainwashed Rip and he became the Atom to help people. Thawne countered that Ray could've used his technology to power whole cities but instead used it for himself as to become greater and that there was no shame in that.

When they needed to know the angle for re-entry into the atmosphere, without Gideon, Ray went over to Thawne for his help and he told them the right angle for re-entry. When they landed, Thawne fazed himself out of the cell but was intercepted by Ray holding a speedster weapon. Thawne commented on the irony as he had invented the weapons and they were being used against him. Ray knew that Thawne had to leave quickly as he was a
   time remnant
   and something would come for him so he couldn't search the ship for the fragments. Thawne knew he was right and told him that they would meet again before he left.

Thawne was at the base and noticed too late that the Legends had robbed the vault and stole back the two fragments of the spear that they possessed. Thawne was furious and Damien Darhk mocked him that Thawne let the Legends steal the fragments but Thawne realized that now the spear was whole and since the Legends couldn't use it, they would either hide or destroy it which would give them a chance to snatch it from them. Darhk thought that was a reasonable plan but thought they had to change how they dealt with the Legends in order to put the odds back in their favor.

The Legion then surprised them at the cathedral along with an armada of German soldiers. When the Legends called a cease fire from the two warring sides on the grounds where Christ's blood was, Darhk and Snart appeared. Snart proved to Rory that the Legends only see him as an expendable thug and never trusted him at all. Moved by this realization, Rory then took the spear and joined up with Legion, much to the shock of his former team. They then threw a bomb into the air to end the cease fire which ended up getting the vial of Christ's blood destroyed. Rory thought that they were all now dead but Snart revealed that he had an escape plan ready and, right then and there, Thawne moved and sped Darhk, Snart and Rory all to safety.

Thawne, Darhk, Merlyn, Snart and Rory all put their hands on the spear as Merlyn read the incantation and activated the spear for them to rewrite reality. The Legion managed to use the spear to

   Eventually, Merlyn visited S.T.A.R. Labs to speak with Eobard Thawne as he had requested to meet many times but Thawne had been ignoring his calls. Thawne claimed that there was no need to meet anymore as they now all had what they wanted. However, Merlyn claimed that there were things that he still wanted to have changed and Thawne had possession of the spear after he destroyed the Calebros Manuscript. Thawne said the spear was safe in his hands as he was the only one that now could use it as he had memorized the incantation. When Jefferson Jackson came to give Thawne an update of the secret project he was working on, Thawne gave him a subtle threat to speed up its development which had the young man nervously go off before Thawne laughed out in amusement. Merlyn expressed that it was a bad idea for him and Darhk to keep the Legends around and toy with them and that it would've been better to eliminate them. Thawne thought it was better this way as it was more poetic than simply destroying them.

   Later, Thawne summoned Snart and Rory and told them that he believed Merlyn might end up becoming a problem and that it might be best to eliminate him.

It seemed that pieces of his old life were starting to weave back into Nate as he felt the world wasn't right for some reason and Thawne asked for Snart and Rory to kill him. Snart and Rory took Nate out into the wilderness outside Central City but Rory decided instead to attack Snart and save Nate's life.

Amaya soon returns to inform them that Rory had found the other Legends and it seemed that Sara had been killed only for her to appear a few moments later.

He then returned to Snart who was actually waiting for him as he expected the Legends would turn him away. Rory told him, Darhk and Merlyn of the Legends' plan as well as the nature of Thawne's secret project. He was building a thermal reactor to use to destroy the spear. They all felt that Thawne meant to destroy the spear after he used it to lock his own version of reality that had all of them gone.

He then learned that Stein completed the reactor and moved to throw the spear into it to destroy it and ensure that this new reality remained permanent. However, the other members of the Legion arrived and then chaos ensued as everyone tried to get the spear. Eventually, the spear landed in Rory's hands and Snart asked for his partner to give it to him. The Legends tried to remind Rory what happened the last time he gave it to Snart but he argued that before it was Thawne calling the shots and this time, it would be them. However, Rory was done being Snart's 'dog' and gave the spear to Amaya to use. Amaya started to activate its power but before she could finish, Snart froze her with his Cold Gun and then shattered her into pieces in front of all of them. Snart then claimed the spear but Thawne quickly moved and stole it from him before throwing it into the reactor where it disintegrated and rendered the reality permanent. Thawne then decided to let the Legends all live as being alive in this new reality, where they had no power or hope, was a fate worse than death. He also warned the other members of the Legion to not try and cross him again or he would kill them.

Damien was wondering why Sara was letting him go after everything that he had done to her and her team but Sara knew that Darhk would be punished down the line in 2016. Darhk reminded her that if he went down his path he would eventually kill her sister but Sara told him that she knew that and she was okay with it, as was Laurel. Darhk was confused on how she could know that but rather than answer him, she went on and erased his memory.
