   , is a former
   meta-human
   speedster from the twenty-second century, a descendant of the late
   Eddie Thawne
   , a time criminal and the archenemy of

    Barry Allen/The Flash
   </a>
   . Obsessed with the twenty-first century's Flash, Eobard recreated the accident that was behind the Flash's powers, becoming a speedster himself. However, after his very first trip back in time, Eobard learned that he was destined to become the Flash's archenemy and grew to despise the hero, attempting to prove his superiority as Reverse-Flash and becoming the opposite of his former idol. This included creating his own
   negative version
   of the
   Speed Force
   using negative energy and emotions, which he used to travel through time without the Flash being able to detect him. Since then, the two speedsters battled each other for many years, but neither of them was strong or fast enough to defeat the other.
  </p>
  <p key="f88a7b1f-53ba-4be3-bde8-d9a2a5e26a65">
   After learning the Flash's secret identity, Eobard traveled back in time to kill Barry as a child to erase his foe from existence but was thwarted by the Flash of 2024 who brought the younger Barry to safety. The enraged Eobard then killed
   Nora Allen
   and framed
   Henry Allen
   for the crime instead, being known as the

   after the incident. However, Eobard's connection to the Speed Force began fluctuating, trapping him in the early twenty-first century. Realizing that Barry was the only way to return to his time, Eobard killed

    Harrison Wells
   </b>
   in order to assume his identity as the director of
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   , and to push through for the creation of a
   particle accelerator
   to ensure that Barry would become the Flash. Posing as Wells, Eobard mentored the Flash and became the leader of a
   team
   that he assembled to stop the meta-human threats, to increase his protégé's speed so that Eobard could use the hero's connection to the Speed Force to return to his own time. After his plan was exposed and subsequently foiled, Eobard was erased from existence after his ancestor Eddie killed himself to stop him.
  </p>
  <p key="a3e9600f-4415-4bf1-bcc5-d84bf274708b">
   One year after Eobard was erased from existence, Barry prevented Eobard from murdering Nora, creating

   and holding him captive for months. After realizing this mistake, Barry released Eobard, allowing him to kill Nora again; as a result of being pulled out of the timeline Eobard was spared from his fate and continued to exist as a
   time remnant
   , while his original actions remained intact. Due to his own nullified state of existence; he was hunted by
   Black Flash
   , forcing him to seek out the
   Spear of Destiny
   in order to restore his natural existence. Unable to find the object and outrun the enforcer at the same time, Eobard formed a
   supervillain alliance
   . Eobard and his co-conspirators eventually retrieved the Spear of Destiny, which they used to rewrite reality to their whims. Despite its initial success, Eobard's plan was foiled by the
   Legends
   ' de-powering the object, and Eobard was vaporized by the Black Flash.

  <p key="d1051cf5-23bb-4f16-b0bc-0ace8b2d02d7">
   Later, Eobard mysteriously resurfaced as an ally of the
   New Reich
   of
   Earth-X
   . He originally tried to carry out the
   Fuhrer
   's request to perform heart surgery on

   In 2034, Eobard was incarcerated in the meta-human wing of Iron Heights, where his powers were negated by

   dagger
   . In 2049, he began mentoring
   Nora West-Allen
   , claiming to be working towards a less villainous legacy, as he was scheduled for execution. However, the real reason why he mentored Nora in traveling to the past was to destroy the dagger and free him. After the dagger was destroyed, Eobard was freed, moments before his execution. He briefly fought Nora and Barry before Nora began to be erased from existence. After the two ran away to enter the
   Negative Speed Force
   at Eobard's fervent suggestion, Eobard made his escape.

   and the creation of the new
   multiverse
   , Eobard's spirit joined the other Harrison Wells of the old multiverse in being fused to the brainwaves of
   Harrison Nash Wells
   , the last surviving Wells. As Eobard's body was a copy of Earth-1 Harrison Wells, it gave him an easier access to possessing Nash. As his specter was composed of negative particles and emotions, his hatred for everyone became so extreme that he even tried to kill
   Cisco Ramon
   , despite how he thought of him as a son and he explained how he wanted to brutally kill Barry and
   Team Flash
   . However, Nash was freed by Barry, Cisco and
   Cecile Horton
   , as Eobard's consciousness was expelled from Nash's body as
   negative tachyons

   Months later, to aid Barry in stopping
   August Heart
   , the Speed Force reconstituted Eobard to help against August. After defeating Heart and seeing that Barry's speed was too great for him, Eobard retreated to fight another day.

   Eobard later created and became the host of the
   Negative Still Force
   , which allowed him to travel in time wherever he pleased and alter/manipulate time to his desires. This kickstarted
   Armageddon
   as part for his masterplan to defeat his archnemesis once-and-for all. He started by manipulating time to cause the death of
   Joe West
   and erasing Barry's memories of the event. Eobard then started manipulating time to drive Barry insane, such as framing him for being
   Joseph Carver
   's mole, which got Barry suspended from the CCPD.

   Eobard's mechinations caused his nemesis to supposedly go rogue and cause the destruction of the Earth in 2031, by Armageddon, which led to
   Despero
   to travel back in time to 2021 in an attempt to stop Barry. After escaping Despero, Barry traveled to 2031 to try to stop himself from destroying the Earth and much to his horror, he found out that Eobard used the Negative Still Force to become a successful businessman and get engaged to
   Iris West-Allen
   . However, with
   Damien Darhk
   's help, Barry ultimately prevented the
   alternate timeline
   that Eobard created from ever happening.

   After the timeline was changed back to normal, Eobard was being erased from existence by the timeline itself, even his connection to the Negative Speed Force was not able to prevent this from happening. As a result, Eobard asked Team Flash to help save his life. The group as a whole was initially reluctant to do so, but Barry ultimately saved Eobard's life by severing the latter's connection to the Negative Speed Force. Eobard was then sent to an
   A.R.G.U.S.
   prison.

   Eobard was born in 2151 into an
   affluent bloodline of politicians, scientists, and captains of industry
   . A distinguished member within his own family, his first name "Eobard" is apparently even more distinguished.
   In his childhood, he was taught astro-navigation in grade school and grew up at a time when cows were extinct.
   Eobard is also quite knowledgeable of his family's history, knowing of
   Eddie Thawne
   despite history having virtually no apparent record of Eddie's existence, considering his ancestor to be a failure within their family.
   In his adulthood, Eobard became a scientist, eventually joining the academia as a professor and spending years unlocking the
   Speed Force
   's secrets.
   At some point, he also designed an
   anti-speedster rifle
   .
  </p>
  <p key="74380055-faaa-40a8-bd9a-5100dbca064d">
   Having spent years discovering the Speed Force's secrets, Eobard learned of the
   <a href="Barry Allen (Earth-1).html" key="d4c86ffa-dbe5-4a93-939a-02bfd27bebcd" title="Barry Allen (Earth-1)">
    Flash
   </a>
   , the
   Central City
   superhero of the 21st century, and grew to idolize eventually to the point of obsession and desiring himself to be just like. After years of researching, Eobard learned how his idol gained super powers to recreate the accident that was originally behind said powers of superhuman speed; as a result, Eobard became a
   meta-human
   speedster and gaining superhuman speed and the power of
   time travel
   through a Speed Force connection. He also created or obtained a
   suit
   similar to Flash's but with the opposite colors. Using his speed abilities, Eobard somehow learned on how to use his powers to travel through time and traveled back to an unknown point in 21st century and eventually learned that he was instead destined to become the "Reverse-Flash," his own idol's greatest enemy and not the speedster himself.
  </p>
  <p key="7504ff37-7093-410c-a780-da95c0dc99fd">
   Despising Flash with every fiber of his being, he made it his life's work to prove his superiority as a speedster, indirectly fulfilling his destiny in the process as he descended into insanity. He vowed that for everyone Flash saved Eobard would kill more, everyone who Flash was loved by, Eobard would take.
   At some point, Eobard, in both his obsession to be the exact opposite and to time travel undetected, created a
   Negative Speed Force
   .
   At some point during his time-travels, he also obtained possession of
   Gideon
   , an artificial intelligence program created by his former idol, and began searching various moments throughout history to learn when his target was active.

   Presumably sometime in the 2180s or 2190s, after learning he was to be the Flash's destined archenemy, Eobard began traveling back in time to find when Flash was active and after several searches proved fruitless, he eventually traveled back to the year of Flash's origins, starting their war across time.

   The Reverse-Flash arrived in January 2016, Central City.
   After Gideon confirmed his whereabouts, he began searching for the Flash. Eobard rigged a truck to drive at high speeds and collide with a building to lure Flash out, and was successful. Pleased to have located the exact time era Flash was active, Eobard planned his return home to properly plan his next attack and broke into one of
   Mercury Labs
   ' offsite facilities, and prepared equipment designed to act as a time machine to send him back to his own time. However, Eobard was unable to replicate the tachyon power source and sought out Dr.
   Tina McGee
   .

  <p key="043b115e-f06d-4572-8691-635d8e784a1f">
   Storming Mercury Labs and killing four guards, he confronted Tina but was interrupted by Flash's arrival. However, Reverse-Flash was surprised when Flash addressed him by his real name, revealing Flash already met him at some point in the future and that Flash had seen him die. However, Reverse-Flash simply thanked Flash for telling him of his impending fate and told Flash he now knew what time period Flash was from and that his nemesis would soon die instead, and he knocked Flash out before taking Tina to the offsite facility.
  </p>
  <p key="fe85b9dc-8950-4eb2-a7ae-d3c0640b9d51">
   When Eobard showed his device, Tina recalled a "man in a yellow suit" tried to steal another tachyon device the previous year. Upon hearing this, Eobard realized that he must have gotten stuck in the past at some point in his future, having been unable to access enough Speed Force energy. Eobard ordered Tina to accelerate the energetic properties within the tachyon device. But when Tina expressed doubts, Eobard vibrated his hand and calmly told Tina to learn or die.

   After Tina finished the work at 9:52 pm, Eobard prepared to kill Tina anyway but Flash arrived, subdued him, and destroyed the machine. Angered but soon unwavered by his nemesis's sabotage to his trip home, Eobard said he would find another way to travel to the future and boasted his superiority to Flash before issuing a challenge to catch him. Both Reverse-Flash and Flash began racing throughout the streets of Central City, but Flash managed to anticipate his path and intercepted him, culminating with Flash catching Reverse-Flash. Flash proceeded to severely beat Reverse-Flash almost to death in a fit of rage for his future actions. Only reluctantly stopping himself from delivering a death blow, Flash instead knocked him out and placed him in
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   ' pipeline prison.

   During his imprisonment, Eobard was visited by
   Cisco Ramon/Vibe
   , asking how his ring worked. Confused yet curious, Eobard talked to Cisco and deduced he must have a history with him in the future, but was confused as to why the engineer only wanted to know how his ring worked. However, Cisco told Eobard of being the one that found him because of the young engineer's metahuman powers given by Eobard's future self. Cisco also revealed that Eobard would help build the very prison he was incarcerated in, leaving Eobard puzzled to learn of his future actions and developed an almost instant fascination with Cisco.

   Eobard was later approached by Flash (unmasked but concealed in the shadows), asking his foe of his hatred's source. Eobard explained his obsession with his desire to be like his idol himself, so much that he spent years learning how his idol gained these powers and succeeded in replicating them. Then he traveled through time and learned that he was going to become his own idol's greatest enemy, rather than be Flash himself. He opted to become the reverse of everything Flash was, vowing to kill as many people as Flash saved. As Flash was disgusted to learn what was behind Eobard's motivations, even revealing that
   someone
   had been killed by Eobard's future self, Eobard angrily stated that he had become better than Flash and was the one thing Flash could never stop, and he promised that one day he would learn his nemesis's real name.

   Shortly after, Eobard was approached by an
   intelligent individual
   and realized that his imprisonment has
   ruptured the timeline
   . However, Eobard doubted the individual knew how to send him back without Tina's tachyon device, but the man said he had instead developed an alternate method to send him home. Fascinated with his warden, Eobard asked the man's name, but the man refused to identify himself, claiming to be no one of consequence, yet Eobard was unconvinced and was instantly fascinated by the individual.

   Eobard was released from his cell and informed of
   Team Flash
   's alternate method of sending him back to the future, to have both him and Flash run at high enough speeds to create a wormhole through which Eobard can return to his own time. Eobard also gloated of winning again, mockingly speaking in the past tense for all his future actions. As they prepared, Eobard vowed they would meet again and Flash agreed but also vowed to stop him every time, and both Flash and Reverse-Flash sped around the particle accelerator's ring. After gaining enough speed, the wormhole was created and Flash hurled Reverse-Flash through the portal and Reverse-Flash successfully returned to his own time.

   After his first encounter with the Flash, Eobard would subsequently go on to travel through time again and again to the early 21st century to fight his former idol. The two speedsters would then fight each other in various different times, with neither of them managing to defeat the other,
   though Eobard was confident that he was always one step ahead of his enemy. Eobard stated they had "been at this a long time"
   and according to the Flash he described their fights as spanning over the course of centuries, implying that Flash may have also fought Reverse-Flash in his own time as well. Whatever transpired, Eobard would feel as though "nothing is forgiven"
   and would sometimes ponder of "which of us is right" to hate the other (with Flash's possible reason for hating him being for future actions Eobard had yet to commit). Though Eobard hated Flash over the course of their war, he seemed to have some respect for his nemesis, acknowledging his former idol as a veteran hero and an intelligent individual who wouldn't use time travel for selfish or foolish reasons, unlike himself.

   During his time-travels, he learned about Cisco's "great and honorable" destiny as the superhero Vibe.

   Jay Garrick/The Flash
   of
   Earth-3

   Atom

   Hawkgirl

Their fight caused several trucks to start leaking their contents onto the streets, and caused power outages spread over 20 blocks throughout the city. The speedsters then started battling over two overturned tanker trucks, and the lightning emitted from them caused the oil from one of them to ignite. While sounded by smoke, the two speedsters had a very heated conversation on an unknown matter before speeding off, leaving Green Arrow, Atom, and Hawkgirl behind. The two then continued their fight up and down an unknown avenue before Flash and him vanished without a trace in an explosion of light.

   aiming to murder the 11-year-old Barry and erase his nemesis from existence as he had planned before, but he was pursued by the Flash from 2024, hindering his plans. The two fought inside the Allen house around Nora, each landing solid hits on each other but their skills were fairly equal. When the 11-year-old Barry entered the room, Reverse-Flash moved in for the kill, but Flash intervened and transported the younger Barry to safety 20 blocks away, much to Reverse-Flash's outrage. However, Reverse-Flash quickly theorized another way to achieve his goal: kill Nora and frame Henry for the crime in the hopes that such a tragedy would traumatize Barry enough to derail from his nemesis's destiny, and he'd be free to return to a future without Flash.

   Eobard soon realized that the reason for his unstable Speed Force connection was because his own status as a speedster was dependent upon Barry's. Therefore, if Barry never became Flash in the past, then Eobard never would have become Reverse-Flash in the future. With this revelation, Eobard realized he needed Barry to become a speedster in order to return to his own time. Thus, Eobard traveled to

   Harrison Wells

   Tess Morgan

   Eobard spied on Harrison and Tess while on a date where Harrison proposed S.T.A.R. Labs' concept to Tess downtown in Starling City.

   Later that night, Eobard rigged the road with a spike strip and caused Harrison's car to crash, killing Tess and injuring Harrison. He dragged Harrison out of the car, and identified himself to Harrison as well as the terrified scientist's supposed role in 2020. Eobard then took out his
   appearance-stealing device
   , and attached one end to Harrison and to the other to himself. He acclimated Harrison's DNA which literally made himself an identical duplicate of Wells on a genetic level while the genuine Harrison died in the process.
   Afterwards, he buried Harrison's body in a grove near the bridge
   and took his victim's place in the car. When the police found him, he introduced himself as Wells, officially adopting the identity.
   Eobard told the police the car crashed due to a tire blowout, thereby keeping Harrison's murder a secret. Eobard then moved to Central City to carry out his plan and build S.T.A.R. Labs there instead to ensure Barry gained his powers earlier, giving the cover story that he moved away from Starling City because of too many reminders of Tess.

   As Wells, Eobard devoted his life to S.T.A.R. Labs' creation and its
   particle accelerator
   , using past knowledge but taking precautions to ensure his plan would work, keeping close observation throughout Barry's whole life by setting up cameras all over Central City, and even in the West household, where Barry lived following Nora's death.
   To avoid the attention of

   , Eobard took precautions to avoid unnecessary timeline alterations.
   Eobard also came to like
   Big Belly Burger

  <p key="7033d418-8546-4dde-b75a-732f07df87ee">
   As S.T.A.R. Labs was created, Eobard built a
   secret room
   accessible only via hand-print where he kept his belongings, including the
   Gideon
   program which was still able to stay informed of future events, including a newspaper article written by Iris on the 2024 crisis.
   This paper acted as a deadline as to the remaining time Eobard had to harness Barry's speed and Eobard further used it to keep tabs on the timeline, and if any changes occurred, take the necessary steps to get the timeline back on track for his own sake.
   Eobard kept the
   Reverse-Flash suit
   on a display case and stored a second suit away in the room.
   He also set himself up in a
   mansion

   Shortly after, he began the particle accelerator's constructions but made some alterations first to ensure the dark matter released would spread throughout Central City, with the aim of creating a lightning bolt that would strike Barry with the Speed Force connection, though did not care that other people would either become meta-humans themselves or be killed.
   To ensure Barry's cooperation when the time came, he built the accelerator to act as a time machine of sorts that Barry (when fast enough) could use to go back and prevent Nora's death while Eobard could return to his time in the wormhole left behind as a result of this time venture. To account for the possibility of Barry's increasing speed against him, Eobard planed to exploit Barry's speed only when Barry was fast enough to time travel not one second later, thereby giving him enough opportunity to kill Barry if necessary.
   To motivate Barry further when the time came, Eobard began working on a way to restore his own Speed Force connection via various tachyon technologies, thus giving him significantly faster speed than as compared to Barry's then-novice abilities. But because of his own unstable connection to the Speed Force, these fixes of tachyon energies would only be temporary and would unexpectedly vanish from time to time, leaving him powerless.

  <p key="41750020-d5c0-4c33-98d9-9594221c4032">
   Eobard observed Barry's personal life as an unseen influence, initially looking upon his future enemy with nothing but hate but soon growing fond of the youth (as he hated but Flash's future version).
   Eobard's actions had profound impacts on Barry's life both as the so-called "man in yellow" (an alternate name to the Reverse-Flash before his true alter ego was revealed) and as Wells. As the former, he became Barry's greatest fear and driving force to become a C.S.I. with the
   Central City Police Department
   , with Barry hoping to one day find some evidence of Henry's innocence and uncover Eobard's identity. As the latter, Barry would grow to idolize "Wells" and was described as being obsessed with him without knowing who he really was (an ironic reverse of events as Eobard had once been obsessed with the Flash without knowing his former idol's identity either), not learning much about him despite reading his
   600-page biography
   twice.
   Eobard also kept just as close observation of Eddie and took whatever precautions were needed to ensure Eddie would continue their bloodline, thus ensuring his own existence.

   He knew Stagg wasn't a really philanthropist but a greedy and corrupt man famous for others' scientific achievements.
   He once met Queen at a charity event, with one of the subjects of discussion being Oliver.
   Eobard also thought of Felicity in his search for promising young minds to help with his work as he foresaw Felicity's "great things"
   and became an acquaintance with a younger version of Tina because of Harrison, though Tina always sensed something was different with "Wells" after Tess's death.
   At some point after
   Thomas Snow
   's faked death, Thomas kept in touch with several scientists, including Eobard, who created a secret video feed from S.T.A.R. Labs to the site that Thomas was hiding in the North Pole.

   In 2004, Eobard was approached by General
   Wade Eiling
   to work on a military project together to create soldiers with physic abilities, presenting new opportunities financially and scientifically and Eobard agreed. While working at S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard adopted
   Grodd
   , a pet gorilla that he kept at S.T.A.R. Labs who he became close, with Grodd later viewing Eobard as his "father." In 2009, Eobard learned that Eiling had been using Grodd as a test subject and was torturing the gorilla in the process. When Eobard discovered this, he berated Eiling in a furious argument with the general and cancelled the project, but still had "big plans" for Grodd.

   Ronnie Raymond
   , and
   Hartley Rathaway

   He also hired
   Arthur Light
   , a man who developed a lethal high powered shockwave rifle. However, Eobard fired Arthur for his apparent insanity around 2012.

   At one point during the particle accelerator's construction, Eobard gave the S.T.A.R. Labs team a strict deadline to work on the synchrotron, causing the team to struggle.

   After opening up to questions,
   Marlize DeVoe
   asked Eobard if he had indeed planned for every event and outcome after the accelerator's activation. Eobard recognized the DeVoe name and realized that Clifford was also there. He told Clifford of being a big fan of DeVoe's 'work', subtly hinting at the man's future as one of the Flash's greatest enemies, and wished Clifford luck.

   Back in the cortex after the press conference, Cisco alerted Eobard of an oncoming storm, but Eobard assured him that it would not effect the accelerator's activation.
   As Eobard was about to turn the accelerator on, he got the sensation that something was amiss; indeed, Eobard's suspicion was rightful as a version of the Flash from 2018 and his
   daughter
   had time-traveled to 2013 and had just then entered S.T.A.R. Labs. Eobard left the room and walked towards the Time Vault, with the future speedsters having just phased inside. Before he could investigate, he was stopped by Cisco and Caitlin. Eobard asked Caitlin to have Ronnie run the accelerator's number's one more time and to bring the bottle of Dom Pérignon out to celebrate. After Caitlin left, Eobard told Cisco of his belief that the youth would go on to do great things, subtly hinting at Cisco's future that he once witnessed. The two then attempted a handshake before heading back to the lab.
   The particle accelerator was then switched on. As the team celebrated, however, particles began to behave abnormally, such as liquids floating in the air, followed by a loud bang from the particle accelerator. Eobard sent Ronnie and Cisco down to manually shut the particle accelerator down before anything bad happened.

   After Ronnie had vented the system to assure S.T.A.R. Labs' safety but was seemingly killed in the process, Cisco called Eobard down to the chamber. Eobard made his way down but before doing so, went into the Time Vault to see Barry struck by lightning, pleased to see that his plan worked.
   The wave of energy from Eobard's resulting explosion also created countless meta-humans and led to at least 16 people dying.
   In addition to Barry, Grodd was also affected by the particle accelerator, and the dark matter, combined with Eiling's drugs which had been injected years earlier, activated and mutated into a hyper-intelligent gorilla and escaped the cage. Eobard allowed Grodd to roam free in the sewers, continuing to grow in intelligence and size.
   Eobard also suspected that Cisco was affected by the dark matter (presumably due to having interacted with Cisco's future self who explained his powers) but could never confirm his suspicions as Cisco showed no signs of having powers.

   Following the explosion, Eobard was brought to
   Central City Hospital
   just as the comatose Barry was. He was recognized by
   Dr. Ambres
   , who reported that he had no feeling below his waist. As the doctors examined him, Eobard watched Barry's comatose body being taken in.
   Eobard began pretending to be paralyzed from the waist down, not just to keep suspicion of his future activities as the Reverse-Flash away from himself, but also rigging his
   personal wheelchair
   with a
   machine
   to feed him a Speed Force connection via tachyons and make him faster than even Barry and maintain his already ruptured connection.
   He also used the wheelchair to store a flash drive in which he kept his personal notes.

   After Barry was put into a coma due to the lightning strike caused by the shock-wave, Barry's condition eventually went critical. Eobard convinced
   Joe West
   (Barry's foster father) to allow him to move Barry to S.T.A.R. Labs. However, Joe never fully trusted Eobard and knew something wasn't right but was so desperate to see Barry awake that he ignored those feelings. While Barry was at S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard one day remarked how amusing it was to see how helpless Barry was, and how easy it would've been to just kill his future foe then and there. He also remarked the irony of him going back to kill and now needing to ensure Barry's existence to return to his own time, and though remarking how interesting it's been watching Barry grow up. However, Eobard firmly stated that nothing is forgiven and that one day Barry will die.

   After Barry woke from the coma, Eobard was called down to the lab to talk to Barry. He took Barry around S.T.A.R. Labs, explaining what had actually happened on the night of the particle accelerator explosion and how they'd moved Barry. Before they could run more tests, Barry left. After having realized Barry had the ability to run at superhuman speed, Eobard and the team went to an
   airfield
   where they sought to test Barry's speed. Eobard cautioned restraint, although Barry instead ran at full pelt, accidentally running into barrels of water. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Barry told Eobard the story of Nora's murder and suspected belief that perhaps there were more powerful humans, perhaps like the man who murdered Nora, oblivious to the fact that he was, in fact, talking to the very man responsible. Keeping this secret safe, Eobard told Barry of being most definitely unique.

  <p key="09227352-1197-40d1-b7c9-8ffe07be93a3">
   Following a later run-in with
   Clyde Mardon's
   weather manipulation, however, Barry returned, angry that Eobard had seemingly lied. He admitted fault, explaining that the explosion had released various forms of seemingly theoretical energy across the city, including anti-matter, dark energy, and x-elements. Barry mentioned planning to stop Clyde, though Eobard attempted to stop Barry from taking the risk, as Barry was incredibly important in terms of scientific advancement. Despite Eobard's claims that Barry was not a hero, only simply a boy who was struck by lightning, a furious Barry stormed out of S.T.A.R. Labs, determined to subduing Clyde.
  </p>
  <p key="97a42c04-a70c-4614-b692-015cffeebf41">
   Though seemingly for scientific reasons, Eobard's words were clearly an attempt to sway Barry away from his heroic destiny and exploit Barry's powers without worrying about an impending death by other metahumans' hands. Following Barry's departure, Eobard eventually realized the only way to make Barry faster was to allow the youth to fight the other meta-humans, to push himself to his limits. As Barry struggled to unravel a tornado Clyde had made, Eobard intervened over the communication, apologizing, reassuring Barry that he did, in fact, believe, that Barry was a hero and could right Eobard's wrongs. An encouraged Barry, heeding the words of his mentor, then managed to unravel the tornado and stop Clyde. Eobard later went into his secret room and checked up on the future and was relieved to see the future was intact.

   After having acted as a hero, Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Eobard again cautioned restraint to Barry, telling his protégé to make sure to know his limits. When Barry later tried to act the hero again and passed out, Barry was taken to S.T.A.R. Labs and despite being scolded, they decided to try some tests. As Barry began running on a
   modified treadmill
   , causing the youth to eventually pass out, Eobard identified that it had to do with Barry's glucose levels, due to an extremely fast metabolism processing it too fast. They hooked Barry up to 40 IV bags before the youth finally awoke. As they began discussing a new diet for Barry, Joe entered the room; Eobard was surprised to see Joe. He reassured Joe that they were looking out for what was best for Barry, though Joe disagreed that what they were doing was the way to do it, leading to an argument between Barry and Joe. After Barry returned to S.T.A.R. Labs after been beaten up by another
   meta-human
   identified by blood samples as
   Danton Black
   , Barry decided against trying to take Danton down despite Eobard's support and was adamant that what they were doing was a mistake.

  <p key="d08d855a-a828-41d1-bd51-c5ce987e079c">
   Following that, Eobard went to talk to Joe. After briefly talking with Stagg, he claimed to Joe that next time Barry suited up, the youth would doubt himself. Eobard headed back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Caitlin was able to grow a clone of Danton from a replicating cell, so they called Barry in and explained this. The clone promptly awakened, presumably due to the prime Black activating some clones, and Joe hurried in through the doors, shooting the clone and reassuring Barry that only a meta-human could stop meta-humans, realizing Eobard was potentially right. They talked to Barry when he reached
   Stagg Industries
   and Eobard noted that he had to find the prime Danton. After gaining the upper hand, Barry attempted to save Black from falling to his death but was told by Black that he wished to die, before forcibly letting go of Barry's hand and killing himself. The team watched a news report of it on the TV afterwards. Barry mentioned that he tried to prevent Danton's death but Eobard reflected that sometimes when people break, they can't be put back together. Following that, Eobard visited Simon with Stagg making claims to exploit the so-called "Streak." Seeing Stagg's greed as an obstacle to his own plans for Barry, Eobard stood up from his wheelchair and fatally stabbed Simon, claiming that the Flash (as his protégé would one day come to be known as) had to be kept safe.

   After the Darbinyan crime family were gassed to death by a presumed meta-human, the S.T.A.R. Labs team began researching what they could, all of them excited by the potential prospects. Joe noted that they would have to find somewhere to hold them, as

Eobard had to go do some modifications while Cisco waited (using the information he acquired from his own imprisonment in 2016). The two later assisted Barry in going after a mist-controlling meta-human inside the
   Central City Shopping Mall
   . However, Barry discovered that the man could turn himself into gas, and inhaled some of the toxic gasses, before racing back to S.T.A.R. Labs where the team painfully extracted the poisonous gas. The team was soon able to identify the makeup of the gas: hydrogen cyanide with traces of a sedative. Barry figured that the two would be mixed in a death row execution and they identified the meta-human as
   Kyle Nimbus
   (proudly nicknamed The Mist by Cisco). Barry went to protect Nimbus's next target (Joe) and the team supported this. Unable to outrun The Mist, they suggested Barry make The Mist tired, and would have to revert to physical, human form eventually; Barry succeeded and Nimbus is taken back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Nimbus was locked up in the particle accelerator prison.

   Eobard defeated Barry in a game of chess while Barry also played a game of table tennis with Cisco and a game of Operation with Caitlin. When Felicity visits S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard greeted Felicity and was more than pleased to meet Felicity, noting he's aware of all the woman's accolades and that he always keeps an eye out for such talent. When Felicity questioned about the possible dangers of what Barry does, Eobard reassured Felicity that everything they do is to ensure Barry's safety and that Barry is in good hands. Eobard was later furious at Cisco for building a

After telling Cisco that weapons don't belong in S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard ordered Cisco to track down where the cold gun is and to do so immediately. After Felicity left, Eobard noted Felicity was a remarkable young woman. Eobard told Cisco to never do anything as to build such a weapon again, though he was unaware of
   another weapon
   that Cisco had built which was also stolen.

   When the metahuman
   Bette Sans Souci
   seemingly begun destroying facilities around the city, Barry revealed that Bette is being pursued by General Eiling to which Eobard revealed his history with Eiling. After Barry met with and convinced Bette not to kill a scientist Bette had a grudge against, Eobard and Caitlin tended to Bette at S.T.A.R. Labs. The team learned that Bette was affected by thermite when the accelerator went off and everything Bette touches explodes, thus why Bette was captured by Eiling and experimented on. However, Eiling personally tracked Bette but Eobard distracted the general long enough for Barry to get Bette out of the facility. When the team later learned that Bette's condition couldn't be reversed, Eobard met with Bette, and manipulated the woman into killing Eiling. Bette is stopped by Barry then killed by Eiling but Bette's body began building up to an explosion, forcing Eobard to coach Barry on running on water to drop Bette's body in the water where it exploded safely. Eobard is later visited at S.T.A.R. Labs by Eiling to propose an alliance again but he refused and threatened the general's life if he is ever blackmailed again.

   After Barry failed to stop
   Tony Woodward
   , Eobard told Barry they'd find a way to stop Tony, but told Barry to rest and heal for the time being. A day later, Eobard is visited by Joe, asking for help on Nora's murder case (as Joe did not know that Eobard was the murderer). When Joe asked if his particle accelerator was possibly involved, Eobard reminded Joe that the murder occurred 14 years ago long before his accelerator was even thought of. After a few other suggestions from Joe, Eobard told the detective that they were all highly unlikely. After Barry tries to stop Tony alone, Eobard is furious as they had yet to find a way to stop Woodward. Although Barry could just heal, Eobard said Barry can't heal after possibly being killed. Eobard then told Barry could stop Tony if only moving fast enough as any material can be struck at a high enough velocity.

   The following day, Eobard had a drink with Joe, where Joe subtly suggested that Eobard was involved as he arrived in Central City shortly after Nora's murder. Eobard told Joe to look up Tess before leaving. Having looked up Tess, Joe visited Eobard at S.T.A.R. Labs and apologized for accusing him of murder. Eobard then told Joe about Wells' "past" and why he moved to Central City as there were too many painful memories to endure (presumably acting on Harrison's memories). Later that night as Joe was reviewing the evidence of Nora's murder, Reverse-Flash reappeared and encircled Joe to frighten the detective, briefly allowing his suited face to be seen and stealing the evidence shortly afterward. Before leaving, Reverse-Flash left a death threat towards Iris by pinning a photograph of Iris to the wall with a knife, and the words "stop or else" to scare Joe away.

   In an entry in his personal log, Eobard noted that Barry was driven to use these powers to help people, but stated that this was keeping Barry from realizing full potential. He later told Barry to "kick it up a notch" in the training. When
   Farooq Gibran
   attacked a transformer station, Barry confronted Farooq but lost the speed abilities. When Eobard went to check on the future, he learned, to his shock and rage, that the timeline had altered; instead of the crisis in 2024, the future now told of the post office's permanent shutdown and there was no record of the Flash or Barry. While Thawne desperately searched for a solution, Farooq attacked S.T.A.R. Labs seeking vengeance for his friends' deaths caused in the accelerator explosion, and caused a blackout that rendered the lab completely exposed to attack.
  </p>
  <p key="1ec7cf02-8466-4f7e-a7d2-31325ef985d1">
   To stop Farooq, Eobard theorized that Barry's cells were still altered and if they could redirect dark matter directly into Barry, they could recharge his protégé's cells. As Cisco worked on using the treadmill as a conduit to achieve this, Eobard released Tony, offering freedom in exchange for killing Farooq to buy them enough time to achieve their plan though this came at the cost of Girder's life. Later, he had a brief argument with Barry about sacrificing Tony to stall Farooq, angrily insisting that he had merely done what was necessary, though Barry became disgusted that Eobard would so willingly sacrifice someone's life, unaware of the man's future reputation of doing just that.

  <p key="d87b146e-a42b-44be-a913-0e2b3a7e3e3a">
   When Farooq cornered Team Flash, Eobard confronted Gibran, reciting from memory the names of everyone who died in the particle accelerator disaster, and demanding that Farooq leave the others alone, saying that he was the only one who deserved to be punished. Farooq agreed and blasted him out of his wheelchair. He was seemingly helpless to move (though faking in reality), however, Barry finally regained his own speed and allowed Farooq to drain once more but the amount of power overloaded and killed Farooq, while the resulting energy fed back on Flash and charged up his speed further. After Flash defeated Farooq, Eobard made another log entry, stating that he had previously been mistaken and that Barry's desire to help others was the key to developing the Flash's potential, not an obstacle as he had thought. Eobard later took a blood sample from Blackout's corpse, while signaling Mist to stay quiet, saying that he was interested in finding out how Blackout had drained Flash's powers.

   After Rainbow Raider robbed a bank by forcing everyone inside to go angry and attempt to murder each other, Eobard aided the team in figuring out how the man did. However, they were distracted by the appearance of The Arrow of Starling City who both Eobard and Joe distrusted, due to the vigilante's previous body count and the terrorist attacks committed by the Dark Archer and Deathstroke since he became active. Barry, however, defend Arrow saying the vigilante is a hero and insisted the two were wrong but Eobard and Joe told Barry to see that Arrow is out of Central City by tonight. Eobard was already aware of Arrow's true identity (presumably because of his future knowledge). Later when Flash suffered the effects of Rainbow Raider's powers and went crazy and tried to murder Eddie, Eobard insisted Felicity call Arrow for help, deliberately revealing Oliver's identity to Team Flash. Preparing a device to make Barry regain his own senses by correcting emotions via the colors of the emotional spectrum, Eobard and Joe arrived just as Flash and Arrow fought and used the device to restore Barry's stability. After capturing
   Roy Bivolo
   , Oliver addressed Team Flash and Eobard also thanked Oliver for the help. Oliver left, felling that something was off about Eobard.

   As a thank you for their help, Barry gave Eobard, Cisco and Caitlin a Christmas present each, but Eobard declined Barry's offer of eggnog. To motivate Barry further, Eobard planned to attack as Reverse-Flash. A few hours later, Reverse-Flash stormed Mercury Labs looking for a
   tachyon prototype
   device, killing the guards yet was unable to reach the device due to the doctor sealing it away and he stormed off. Eobard "helped" Joe and Barry track down Reverse-Flash by building a trap as Joe and Barry secured the bait. Reverse-Flash later spied on Barry as the youth talked to Iris. Barry then noticed him and ran after him, demanding to know why he killed Nora, but Reverse-Flash instead challenged Barry to a fight in a stadium. Reverse-Flash proved to be the better speedster, severely beating Barry down using several coordinated attacks, but told Barry already knew the youth's identity, that they'd fought for a long time. He also told Barry it would be destiny to die at his hands as it was Nora's, leaving the young speedster very confused.

  <p key="4ee495f2-add9-4179-a42f-3b10edfb9794">
   Later S.T.A.R. Labs orchestrated the trap using the tachyon prototype and lured Reverse-Flash in, aided by Eddie's taskforce. But Eobard rigged a hologram of himself as Reverse-Flash that would answer only to Wells. Once the hologram was active, Eobard, Joe, Eddie and the taskforce went down stairs to "confront" Reverse-Flash. As Eobard addressed his hologram, the force-field appeared to fail as nobody was inside for it to stabilize, Eobard rushed into the force-field so fast, it look like Reverse-Flash pulled him into the field, and trapping himself inside. In the field, Eobard created a lifelike speed mirage of himself then suiting up as Reverse-Flash in his hologram's place and repeatedly punched his after image, making it appear to everyone else that Reverse-Flash was trying to kill him.
   After the field disappeared when Joe sabotaged the machine, Reverse-Flash grabs the device to take to his secret room then reappears in the basement, and while still bouncing back and forth to maintain the speed-mirage of Wells. Reverse-Flash kills Eddie's taskforce in seconds without any effort but hesitates when he approaches Eddie, shoving the detective to the side rather than killing (since this would risk his own existence), and attacks Joe.

  <p key="6e11bc97-35a2-4af5-8e0b-67eff3f17246">
   Reverse-Flash reminds Joe of being warned but before he can kill Joe, Flash intercepts and drags him outside. However, Reverse-Flash again proved superior to Flash, but he was timely stopped by a
   pyrokinetic meta-human
   . Reverse-Flash vowed their fight wasn't over and ran off. Arriving back in time to take the place of his speed mirage, Eobard gets tended to by Caitlin and Cisco who profusely apologizes for the force-field failing. Though he assured Cisco it wasn't anyone's fault, Eobard expressed annoyance towards them for not informing him of Ronnie's survival, but assures Caitlin that they will find Ronnie. As his wounds healed, Eobard later places the tachyon prototype on his Reverse-Flash suit. While watching his device harness its power, he says "Merry Christmas" with his distorted voice.

   Eobard, Cisco, and Caitlin continue to train to improve Barry's speed using a drone to fire at. After Cisco called the man in yellow the "Reverse-Flash," Eobard approved of the name unlike Caitlin. After Snart returned, Barry decided to pursue Snart, though Eobard warned Barry that Reverse-Flash is a greater threat. Due to Snart's threat, Eobard and Cisco presented the CCPD with a shield that could withstand Snart's cold gun. During Barry's battle with Snart and Rory, Eobard realized the best way to let Snart's and Rory's guns cross streams is to move slower.

   As Hartley attacked Rathaway Industries but was stopped by the Flash from 2015, Flash's 2016 version time-traveled to intervene and incapacitate Flash's 2015 self before switching their emblems to avoid confusion. Flash's 2016 self then proceeded to capture Hartley just like in the original timeline, taking the bittered protégé to S.T.A.R. Labs but causing an interference within the communication devices in the process, confusing Eobard slightly. Hartley was subsequently locked up in the Pipeline prison before Barry remembered that Hartley escaped captivity in the original timeline by using EMTs within hearing aids, causing Barry to ask Cisco to test for explosives within Hartley's hearing aids. To Eobard's shock, Barry was correct, and Hartley was ordered to take out these hearing aids, with Eobard offering to replace with non-destructive ones. Eobard was then approached by Barry to present a new equation to getting faster, surprising Eobard to see that Barry had devised such a complex equation with Barry's knowledge in such a short time. As Barry returned after facing a ghost-like creature (which Cisco dubbed a "Dementor" from the

Eobard invited Barry into his quarters to discuss the speed equation. With Barry's back was turned, Eobard stood up and knocked Barry out, claiming that he "figured it out."

   In the lab, after giving Nora water, Eobard questioned how they would get Cicada's
   dagger
   to which Nora answered by showing him a piece of Savitar's
   suit
   . Eobard was stunned to see a piece of Savitar's suit and mocked how Barry hated him with a passion, but yet Savitar (a time remnant of his nemesis from a now-erased future) was a way bigger "jerk" then he ever was. Eobard, however, praised Barry's idea to use a piece Savitar's suit to defeat Cicada, but complimented the "clever girl" after learning it was Nora's idea. After repairing the tool, Eobard bid farewell to the two speedsters and quickly ran to the Time Vault, preparing to talk to Barry's 2016 version. Knowing Nora was still watching him from the lab, Eobard waved at the camera before Nora left.

   After Barry's 2018 version and Nora went to 2013, he interrogated Barry's 2016 version but the youth played dumb. Eobard sped in front of his nemesis and saw Barry didn't even flinch. Barry then attempted to phase out of the cuffs but failed, further proving the fact that this Barry hailed from the future as Eobard had yet to teach his protégé how to phase. Finally Barry referred to him by real name, thus confirming Eobard's theory. Barry told Eobard of needing him to teach how to get faster. However, Eobard quickly realized that Barry being alive in the future could only mean his own plan failed and tries to kill Barry in a rage. However, Barry quickly claimed that Eobard did win, and that he'll be successful into using Barry's speed to get back to his own time. Unfortunately, a singularity had formed and that's why Barry is in the past, to get faster in order to stop it but needed Eobard's help. As Eobard saw this as an opportunity to kill his nemesis, Barry claimed that there's a letter left for his protégé if something happened, detailing Eobard's plan worked and how to stop him. Eobard reluctantly listened to Barry.

   At the same time, the Time Wraith found a way to S.T.A.R. Labs and attacked Cisco, Caitlin and Hartley but they were able to fend it off just as both Eobard and Barry arrive via speed. When Cisco and Caitlin leave for solutions, Barry asked Eobard how to kill a Time Wraith but Eobard revealed there is no known way to kill these creatures hence why speedsters try to avoid them. As Barry searched the police department for any clues, Eobard searched S.T.A.R. Labs, but Cisco and Caitlin were unable to replicate the frequency Hartley used to stop the Time Wraith. As they debated how to stop the Time Wraith, Barry of the present day showed up just as Barry of the future returned. To shut up Barry of the future accidentally revealing future knowledge trying to convince the team of being from the future, Eobard played dumb and pretended that he'd just met Barry of the future, and told the team to prepare the particle accelerator, telling Barry of the future to travel through time to outrun the Time Wraith, while they build a sonic weapon to stop the Time Wraith for good when returning with Barry to 2016. Before sending Barry back, Eobard gave Barry a drive with on tachyon enhancement information, and Flash successfully made it back to the future with Eobard's speed increasing information.

After learning Shawna's powers, Eobard told Barry they should focus on learning Shawna's limits. The following day, Eobard learned from Cisco that Hartley was let out of the meta-human prison (by Cisco), much to his disappointment. Eobard later learned Shawna can't teleport in dark space, as she can only teleport to what she can see. When Flash went after Shawna, he reminded Flash that Shawna can't teleport if the woman couldn't see, leading to Flash busting out all the lights in the tunnel.

   After

   Martin Stein
   was in control of Ronnie's body is due to simple Darwinism. Eobard and Caitlin decide to have a stakeout outside of Professor Stein's home, assuming Martin would be nearby to watch over
   Clarissa Stein
   . While waiting for Stein, Eobard swore to Caitlin his work won't be finished until he brings Stein and Ronnie back to normal. Shortly after, Firestorm came by and the two quickly contacted Barry. While Barry and Firestorm battled, the two followed, though accidentally hit Barry as the latter fell. After learning Martin claimed the two could be separated, Eobard said it was possible, but only theoretically as splitting a human and an atom were different concepts.

   Eobard learned that Ronnie's body was rejecting Stein, causing an exothermic reaction and a possible nuclear explosion. Due to the two only have hours before Firestorm's body detonates, Eobard suggested they may have to kill Firestorm. While the team were outraged of the concept, Eobard told them if Ronnie and Martin knew the consequences, they'd likely sacrifice themselves. In his Time Vault, Eobard pulled a hand gun and Gideon told him it was a crude weapon. Eobard then decided to make a quantum splicer using the tachyon device, though Eobard is told it would delay his timeline. Eobard told Gideon there would be no timeline if Central City gets blown up. Cisco and Eobard built the tachyon device which is given to Barry and Caitlin to take to Firestorm. After the splicer was placed on Firestorm, Eobard tells the two to get away from Firestorm.

   Eobard greeted Ronnie, thanking Ronnie for sacrificing himself to protect those around and is introduced to Martin. Eobard then did medical work on Martin, checking if the professor still had the ability to harness nuclear energy. Eobard learned Martin's unable to and reported this to the team. When Eiling attacks Ronnie, Eobard pays a visit to the general. Eiling asked Eobard to surrender Firestorm, though Eobard refused the general brought up the Flash's identity. While conversing with Martin, Eobard spiked the professor's drink. With Martin passed out, Eobard contacted Eiling, and Eiling took Martin away. Eobard claimed to the team he was left helpless when Eiling came by to take Martin. When Barry said he would go after Eiling, Eobard reminded Barry what Eiling could do to him.

  <p key="7e0b1876-f550-41b9-8dab-9b74060eff1c">
   In search for Martin, the team used Ronnie as the two are still connected and Eobard convinced them both to use the quantum splicer to merge against, but this time accept the balance they successfully became more stable as Firestorm. Fixing another obstacle, Reverse-Flash later abducts Eiling from a military office to Grodd's home in the sewers, and revealed himself to Eiling. Unmasking himself, Eobard told Eiling that he protects metahumans (his own kind) and unleashed Grodd both to silence Eiling, and for vengeance for what the general did to Grodd years before.

   Dante Ramon
   's birthday party but Cisco decided the best thing was to not go at all, remarking how things had been much better since Cisco stopped seeing Dante. Though Eobard is saddened to learn Cisco was still on bad terms with the Ramon family, they were distracted by an alert of a break in at the

Eobard told Cisco nothing would stop him from returning to his home, though Cisco offered help. Eobard noted Cisco to be smart, but not smart enough to bring him back to his time.

   Barry stopped after running, confusing Eobard and Cisco and reminded Barry to get to the morgue but Barry claimed to have been there yesterday, confusing them both. When Barry returned, they're all told that Mark is the killer and on a vendetta to avenge Clyde and Eobard deduced Mark was affected by the particle accelerator the same way Clyde was. However, Barry finished Eobard's sentence and correctly guessed almost every word Cisco and Caitlin were about to say to each other before they did. With this, Eobard realized that Barry had in fact time traveled. After learning Barry had traveled back one day, Eobard stressed the importance of keeping history intact which meant not telling him and tells Barry to repeat the events of the day again without and to not tell anyone or alter anything. Eobard checked in with Gideon but is assured the future remained intact.

   Barry, however, ignoring Eobard's advice and went and captured Mark anyway before Mardon could commit these crimes. Eobard (angered that Barry had altered time) reminded his protégé that whatever tragedies time had averted would somehow replaced with even worse ones. Eobard had Barry run on the treadmill in an attempt to re-create the conditions that allowed Barry to time travel in the first place, but even his highest speeds couldn't achieve it.

Reverse-Flash later went to
   Central City Picture News

Learning from Bridge that everything about him was on a drive, Reverse-Flash killed Mason. To cover his tracks, Reverse-Flash then looked at Mason's computer and noted that Mason really was onto something. He fixed the office, moved Bridge's body, and destroyed all the evidence. Later at S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard consulted Barry's decision to let Snart go. When Barry was about to ask Eobard something, but halted, Eobard asked what his question was. Barry simply told him it was nothing wished him goodnight, to which Eobard returned.

However, Eobard noticed Barry seemed cranky but Joe assured him that Barry was just having a bad morning. Later when the Trickster made another broadcast, Barry showed further signs of angst towards Eobard but he surmised it must be because of Barry's previous visit with

When the Trickster uploaded a broadcast informing the public of a bomb in the city and left it's rough location, Flash failed to find it but Eobard realized it was a trick but Flash refused to listen to him much to everyone else's confusion.

After succeeding in foiling the Trickster's plot, Barry brought Henry to S.T.A.R. Labs to meet everyone where Henry thanked all of them for their efforts, especially Eobard.

After Joe and Cisco returned from Starling City, Eobard gave his regards to Eddie and talked to Joe about the visit, but Joe questioned why he never went back. Eobard again lied and claimed it was because of Tess but reflected that they had one trait in common of being widowers, regarding Iris's

He later helped Cisco and Caitlin work on a device to induce lucid dreaming, which they claimed was for physiologists dealing with people traumatized by meta-human incidents. Eobard later called and informed Barry of a fire in a building nearby but Flash was unable to retrieve all the civilians before the fire burnt out of control, but Eobard told Flash to rotate his own arms at high velocities which extinguished the flames. After Eobard returned from a conference, Caitlin informed him that Cisco finally figured out how Reverse-Flash "escaped," and Eobard realized his cover was blown. Eobard sent Hannibal to pose as Wells and spring the trap the team had set for Eobard as a means to get a confession to Nora's murder. After Joe killed Bates, Eobard finally dropped his facade and addressed the team via the intercom, admitting to using Bates as a distraction by promising his freedom. As Barry and Caitlin expressed their anger for ruining their lives, Eobard actually claimed to understand their anger but tried to assure them that his actions have actually improved their lives, even admitting that he had grown to love working with the team. Barry angrily told Eobard to confront him, and Eobard assured his former protégé that they would fight again, very soon. Eobard then quickly returned to S.T.A.R.

   To distract Team Flash, Eobard ordered Grodd to distract them using whatever means Grodd saw fit while he constructed a device to re-power the particle accelerator, while keeping Eddie tied to a chair. Eddie continued questioning Eobard's claims but Eobard stood by his pride to be a member of their family. He then revealed that history had virtually no record of Eddie.

When his speed recovered, he pinned Al Sah-him to the ground, taunting him about Oliver's apparent original future death at age 86, and prepared for the kill only for Flash to save Al Sah-him. The speedsters then fought all over S.T.A.R. Labs. As both Flash and Reverse-Flash reached the edge of S.T.A.R.

   Eobard was placed inside the pipeline. Sometime afterward, Barry visited him to get answers, addressing him by his real name, and asked why Eobard killed Nora. Eobard explained his feud with the Flash, the circumstances and reasoning for Nora's murder, and that he needed Barry to be a speedster in order to generate enough Speed Force energy to create a wormhole though which he could return home, and in the process Barry could return to the night of Nora's murder thus undo Henry's imprisonment and Eobard's actions. Barry didn't believe him but eventually opened up to Eobard's plan. While enjoying a Big Belly Burger, he explained that his plan required using the particle accelerator, explaining that Barry would have to run at Mach-2 speed through the particle accelerator and collide with a single hydrogen particle. Doing so would send Barry back to any time desired and create a wormhole behind which could be used by Eobard to return to his own time. But what Eobard neglected to tell Team Flash is that doing so would result in a singularity's creation.

   While building a potential time machine for Eobard, Cisco visited him for advise on materials. Cisco also asked how his Reverse-Flash ring worked (reminiscent of Eobard's first meeting with Cisco in 2016). After he tells Cisco what's required, Eobard gets infuriated and confused that Cisco didn't have as much sympathy, comparing his predicament stuck in a different time to Cisco's own
   family estrangement

Eobard apologized, not for killing Cisco and justifying that he had a good reason, but to learn that Cisco had indeed become a meta-human as he'd suspected for sometime and informed Cisco that a "great destiny" awaited his son-esque protégé.

The Reverse-Flash spitefully charged at Flash and fought his former protégé. As Team Flash worked to close the portal, Reverse-Flash beat Flash into submission and prepared to kill Flash, vowing to kill everyone else his former protégé loved, including Henry. As he declared his victory and dived in for the kill, Eddie shot himself in the heart, causing Reverse-Flash's body to flux uncontrollably as his existence began to fade.

However, his actions

   In the event of his demise and his plan to return to his own time were to fail, Eobard made a video confession to Nora's murder for Henry's freedom. Initially, Eobard stood his ground in saying that Barry will never truly be happy, but believed he himself was never really the enemy but the real enemy was in fact Barry himself. Eobard then confesses to Nora's murder, much to his former protégé's shock and delight.

   When the Reverse-Flash grabbed a kitchen knife and attempted to stab Nora, he was attacked by another version of the Flash from 2016, viciously knocking him down. Refusing to let Reverse-Flash kill Nora, and refusing to let him ruin anyone's life ever again, Flash knocked Reverse-Flash out, radically altering the future and undoing many of Reverse-Flash's future crimes.
   His nemesis then took Reverse-Flash back to the new version of 2016, took his ring from him, and constructed a speed-dampening cell using carbine material to imprison him in an abandoned factory. Barry made frequent visits to Eobard to give him food. Unfortunately for both speedsters, Barry's intervention created an

   altogether. Due to Barry's irresponsible actions, a new reality was in place of what they knew, and Eobard was aware Barry's memories would fade in order to adapt to the new timeline. But Eobard kept this to himself simply for amusement, wanting to see how long it would take his nemesis to realize this himself yet was unsure as to why he wasn't losing his own memories. Eobard would remain imprisoned for over three months, growing a beard while in captivity.

   When Barry visited him again to deliver Big Belly Burger, Eobard jokingly asked for the "curly fries" and still promised to destroy Barry's world. However, Barry didn't take Eobard's words seriously and reminded him that Barry now has everything back that both Reverse-Flash and Zoom stole (Nora and Henry are alive in this timeline). Eobard chatisized his nemesis as there's now
   another individual
   as the Flash in this timeline, letting someone else endanger themselves in pursuit of Barry's own happiness. However, Barry simply scoffed at Eobard's words and reminded him that Barry changed time because of what Eobard did, but he stated that Barry will eventually beg him to kill Nora "again."

   When Barry started losing memories, Eobard gets questioned about this. Relieved to see what Barry is experiencing, Eobard explained to Barry that this reality was beginning to overwrite the reality they're familiar with, so that soon Barry won't remember the reality they're familiar with. When Eobard gets asked why he wasn't losing his memories, he replied that he wasn't sure, but he figured out that the more Barry uses speed abilities, the faster Barry loses memories, whereas Eobard hadn't used his speed at all and thus his memories remained intact. However, Barry believed Eobard was trying to manipulate into releasing him from his cell.
  </p>
  <p key="c704f10e-ea98-4133-9b2a-7c12e0f058ac">
   Eobard then frustratingly remarked that his nemesis from the future that he knew and fought for years was far more intelligent than what Barry turned out to be. Eobard stated that soon Barry would forget being a speedster and neither of them would be able to fix reality, thus this timeline would set permanently like concrete and be unchangeable. Barry was fine with it, but Eobard pleaded for Barry to take him back to 2000 to correct what was done and that Nora's death needed to happen in order to make things right. Barry spitefully told him to go to hell, to which Eobard angrily retorted that his nemesis's arrogance would leave both speedsters stranded in a faulty reality. As Barry left, Eobard angrily yelled at Barry, accusing his nemesis of now being the villain.

   When Barry later returned with Iris after finally realizing this timeline is too dangerous for Barry's other friends, Eobard is agreed to be released with Barry's reluctance. Eobard forced Barry to ask to kill Nora and Barry reluctantly did so, expressing hate. Eobard replied with hate in return, but questioned whose anger was truly justified. Eobard was then released and given his ring back. As Barry started to fall unconscious, Eobard expressed his desire to just kill Barry, before saying this time he's got to be the hero, and hauled his nemesis through the Speed Force, coming back to 2000, moments after Flash's and Reverse-Flash's younger selves had fought for the second time. Arriving moments after Flash's earlier self had knocked out his past self, Reverse-Flash's current self taunted Flash's past self, saying that Nora was done for. As a result, the two speedsters' earlier versions dissipated as Reverse-Flash grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed Nora in the chest, correcting the new changes to the timeline, before preparing to bring Barry back to 2016.

   Rather than restoring the timeline, however, Eobard's actions created another new timeline where most of the events before remained intact but a few events were altered,
   one example being S.T.A.R. Labs' now having a
   speed lab
   built by Eobard apparently.
   Being pulled from the timeline, Eobard's
   existence paradoxically remained intact
   , and he retained his memories from the previous timeline as well as his speed after killing Nora.
   No longer sporting a beard, Eobard returned Barry to 2016 while claiming that everything was back to the way it was (at least for him). He tauntingly told that Barry's present wouldn't be the same and would have to simply wait and find out. When Barry asked him what he meant, Eobard appeared pleased to have tormented his nemesis yet again and simply said they'd see each other sometime soon, speeding off to a different time and place.

  <p key="57998b46-39fa-42e3-a31c-b2913b904a78">
   Shortly after, Eobard found himself pursued by the Black Flash, a black-clad demon-like speedster who now served as the Speed Force's enforcer. While initially mistaking Black Flash for a Time Wraith, Eobard quickly realized the monster after him was far more dangerous than a Time Wraith. As a result, Eobard was forced to keep running through time and space to avoid the monster, aided by a
   watch
   that notified him whenever the creature was nearby. Eobard eventually realized that Black Flash was after him because Eddie's suicide was supposed to erase him from existence in 2015, yet he continued to exist due to coming back to 2016 together with Barry. Thus Black Flash was trying to erase Eobard to eliminate the paradoxical threat and restore the ruptured timeline.

   Justice Society of America

   Askaran Amulet
   , a compass detailing the locations of the various pieces and their respective guardians. However, Eobard discovered the Askaran Amulet was divided into two pieces but Eobard discovered one half was in Nazi Germany's possession in 1942 while the other half was in the Soviet Union's possession in 1987. Eobard learned all of this by traveling through time and gathering informations across the 20th century.

   To obtain the Askaran Amulet's first half without interference this time, Eobard personally began working with
   Baron Krieger
   and met with in Paris. Krieger told him the Askaran Amulet was in Berlin though Hitler refused to part with it. Eobard presented a sample of his
   biomolecular enhancer
   , which could be used to create an army of super-soldiers to oppose the JSA. He also claimed it would let Hitler plant the German flag above the White House within months. Eobard gave Kreiger a small dose for one person to confirm the serum's properties, promising to deliver the means for mass production, but only if he obtained the Askaran Amulet. Reluctant, Kreiger agreed and Hitler arranged for the Askaran Amulet to be transported to Eobard's custody.

Reverse-Flash later attacks Hourman at the JSA's headquarters. Reverse-Flash tells Hourman of their encounters "a number of times" as Hourman in this timeline hadn't met Reverse-Flash yet. He then phased his hand through Hourman's chest. As Hourman bled to death, Reverse-Flash stole the Askaran Amulet and sped off before

Pleased to see Rip's reprogramming is successful, Eobard entrusted Hunter to retrieve the Spear of Destiny's piece from the Legends and eventually succeeded.
   After this, Rip tells Eobard about the Spear of Destiny's other fragments being in the JSA's possession and each period of where they were. He first sent Rip to Chicago in the year 3000 to retrieve another piece, killing
   Dr. Mid-Nite
   in the process. Eobard then sent Rip and Damien to Camelot in the year 503 to retrieve
   Stargirl
   's piece, however, Rip gets captured and a piece gets lost to the Legends.

   Eobard takes Swigert's appearance and place on Apollo-13, venturing into space. Since Eobard repaired the oxygen tank that was meant to explode, he caused an aberration that alerted the Legends. While Apollo-13 is in space, Eobard knocked the other astronauts out and dropped his Swigert disguise and made the preparations for landing. However, he discovered Atom has sneaked aboard and they fought, though Eobard is unable to use speed in zero gravity, but Atom managed to beat him and tied him up.

He also informed Palmer that it was easy for Ray to see him as a monster but he had seen history's greatest monsters and he wasn't one of them. Ray scolded him for this claim as he'd killed Nora twice, killed Hourman and brainwashed Rip into killing Dr. Mid-Nite.

Eobard laughed at the irony as he was the one who invented the weapon in the first place. Ray knew that Eobard would try and escape and was aware he was a time remnant because of Eddie's sacrifice, and that something was after him to try and correct the aberration. Eobard confirmed Palmer's suspicions as his watch alerted him that Black Flash was close, and Ray told him he'd have no time to search the ship.

   After failing to retrieve the Spear of Destiny's last fragments, Eobard sent Malcolm and Damien to get the Calebros Manuscript in order to activate the Spear of Destiny to rewrite reality. While he was making a plan to try and track the Legends, he discovered that the Legends had infiltrated the Vanishing Point and stolen their two fragments and fled before Eobard could stop anything. When Damien returned and learned of what happened, Eobard gets scolded for his recklessness, but Eobard realized that now that the Legends had all the Spear of Destiny's fragments, they no longer had to hunt for the holy object piece by piece. However, Damien insisted that in order to succeed, they would need to up their strategy besides just the three of them. Eobard then traveled back to 2014 and located Snart before Leonard had joined the Legends and turned from criminal ways, revealing the man's future death being all they needed to have Snart agreed to help them in getting the Spear of Destiny. After Leonard successfully manipulated Mick into betraying the Legends and steal the Spear of Destiny from them during World War I, Eobard sped into the war-zone and transported Leonard, Darhk and Mick to the Vanishing Point. After Malcolm return with the Celebros Manuscript, the five criminals held onto the Spear of Destiny as Malcolm read the incantation and they began to use the holy object's power to re-write reality to their whims.

Malcolm eventually confronted Eobard in person as there were still some things Malcolm wanted changed, but Eobard insisted that the Spear of Destiny was best kept in his possession as he was the only one who knew how to use the holy object. They were interrupted by Jax informing him the reactor's taking longer than anticipated but Eobard, calmly made subtle threats to motivate. Eobard broke into a hard laugh as Malcolm scolded him for keeping the Legends around as "pets" when the group should be erased altogether, though Eobard considered this poetic justice. Eobard then told Malcolm to leave and enjoy this new life as Malcolm frustratingly left. Fearing Malcolm may be a problem, he asked Leonard and Mick to keep an eye on Malcolm. Before they could go on further, Nate arrived past security, having no knowledge of Eobard, and told him reality was't right.

Eobard annoyingly remarked that Malcolm was right before also being confronted by his own syndicate members demanding the Spear of Destiny.

While the Legends and his syndicate both expressed desire to kill him, Eobard's unwavered by their words as they're hopelessly outmatched against his speed without weapons or powers. However, Eobard did not wish to see the Legends dead, not out of sentiment, but rather to watch suffer and remain trapped in this new reality where everything the Legends have ever accomplished no longer matters. He also allowed his former co-conspirators to live despite their mutiny, but promised to kill them if they tried to oppose him again. Telling all of his opponents to remember this mercy of his, he ordered them to leave his laboratories' premises.

   After returning from a joint mission with Barry and seeing Savitar, Zoom and an earlier version of Eobard (as Wells), Nora sent the latest journal entry to Eobard's cell. As Eobard read Nora's entry, the young speedster had arrived in person to confront him about his past actions. He exited Nora's entry and agreed they needed to talk.
   He commented on how Nora had been gone for a long time. Nora was infuriated with how heartless he was by killing Nora's namesake. Although Eobard expressed remorse for his actions, he also told Nora that his actions indirectly served the greater good, changing not only Barry's destiny, but Nora's as well. He also offered to help Nora in order to pay for his crimes and repair his tarnished legacy, but Nora simply stated that he only cared about himself and bid him farewell before running off. Nora later reappeared again, telling Eobard of wanting to believe there is a good side within Eobard and wants his help. Eobard agreed to help Nora, after which he looks at the countdown, reminding them both that he has little time left.

  <p key="3469fd7a-7481-4fdc-bb6a-ce3455857bb5">
   Nora later returns to inform Eobard that Sherloque suspected Nora to be working with someone. Eobard assured Nora that Sherloque had yet to discern the mystery partner's identity, otherwise Barry would travel to 2049 and threaten to phase his hand through Eobard's heart. Nora was more scared of being hated by Barry if the truth came out, so Eobard suggested to distract Sherloque by helping the detective fall in love.
   After resetting the timeline 52 times to stop Dwyer from killing Team Flash's members, Nora visited Eobard to ask if he was certain that they weren't making things worse. Eobard angrily insisted that he was the only speedster who knew best. Calming himself, he encouraged Nora to stick to their plan, promising they would see Dwyer defeated, Cicada's dagger destroyed and apparently save Barry.

   When Nora visited once again to inform Eobard that the
   Meta-human cure
   is finished and ready to use on Dwyer, in turn, he informed Nora of that newspaper article depicting the last public confrontation between the Flash and Cicada is slowly changing, hinting that something or someone is going to set into motion a new timeline.
   Eobard's fears were soon proven true as Nora returned to inform him that though Team Flash successfully cured Dwyer,
   another equivalent
   of Cicada showed up and took both Dwyer and the dagger. Eobard stated he already knew as evidenced by the unchanged article. He sadly admitted that there was nothing he could do to help and strongly advised Nora to tell the truth to Barry.

   After Nora's secret acquittance with Eobard is revealed to Team Flash, Barry visited Eobard, viciously demanding to know why Eobard tried to 'steal' Nora. Eobard smirked at Barry's emotional outburst, claiming that it was why he had Nora keep that secret from Barry. He told Barry that all Nora truly wanted was to see Barry, and he carried it out as a "final request for a condemned man." Eobard gets bitterly told by Barry that he was finally going to get what he deserved and sped away, as the clock counting down to Eobard's execution ticked down to ten minutes.

   Since Barry left Nora in 2049, Nora met up with Eobard and asked him how he managed to go back in the past without any speedster feeling any disturbance in the Speed Force to which he replied that he created the Negative Speed Force but with various negative effects. After Nora first tried to run into the Negative Speed Force but failed to enter the portal, Nora returned and tried to figure out with Eobard what went wrong when suddenly Iris appears and asked Nora to step away from Eobard to which he replied that Nora should listen to Iris. Nora got mad for Barry not being present and believing in abandonment before running off the scene, much to Eobard's and Iris's shock. Eobard then told Iris that Nora's back in 2019, and offered advice: Nora needs both parents united instead of fighting. Iris angrily told Eobard to leave Nora alone, but Eobard simply noted that he likes Iris's anger. At that moment,

  <p key="59462ca4-e395-42eb-8e0e-a5309b22dcb5">
   After the timer ran out, Trevor taunted him, contemplating the fifteen years Eobard spent imprisoned, and asked him how it felt to know he would finally become extinct. Eobard, unflinchingly, replied that time would tell. Trevor noted missing Eobard, particularly the "rehabilitation sessions." After the last "repent," Trevor commented on the irony of the situation; the very same thing behind Eobard's powers was going to kill him. After more guards entered with a special chamber, designed to keep Eobard in touch during the execution. Eobard got placed inside the chamber as Trevor took his chest plate away, revealing Cicada's dagger inside.

   As the execution was about to start, Eobard was given a necklace with the
   Reverse-Flash ring
   attached. Trevor explained obtaining the object from the Flash Museum, believing that the object should get buried along with him, and asked him to consider it as a "parting gift." Right before Trevor pulled a lever to start the execution, Eobard noticed Cicada's dagger beginning to disappear, and realized that his plan worked and Team Flash succeeded in destroying the dagger in 2019. Trevor pulled the lever, and lethal lightning strikes began rushing to Eobard. But due to the dagger finally being destroyed, Eobard connected to the Negative Speed Force once again after fifteen years, thus getting his powers back. Just as the lightning was about to strike and kill him, Eobard entered
   Flashtime
   and began vibrating his body at super speed, making the lightning pass right through him and destroy the chamber. As his powers regenerated Wells' likeness, he noted how he got his powers "just in time."

   As Eobard broke free, all the guards in the room pointed their guns at him but he remained unfazed, simply declaring that they would die. In a split second, Eobard raced around the room and killed every guard save for Trevor who watched on in horror. As a desperate Trevor told Eobard that he would be able to help him, the speedster merely said that it was "time to repent" (exactly what Trevor used to tell him before torturing him) before using his lightning to torture Trevor similar to how he had been tormented while imprisoned. Eobard then told him to consider what he was about to do as a "parting gift" (like what Trevor said moments ago) before phasing his arm through Trevor's chest, killing his sadistic tormentor instantly.
  </p>
  <p key="0e80949c-44cd-4e0d-addc-09f7ecd09732">
   Eobard then removed the necklace, put on his ring, and began to extract his suit. However, as he was about to suit up once again, time suddenly started to reverse, right to the moment he got out of the chamber before killing the guards. As Eobard was in the middle of his sentence, he heard the Flash and XS saving the guards and Trevor before their deaths, altering the timeline. Realizing that time had been reversed, Eobard turned around and greeted the two heroes while also being impressed that XS figured out how to reverse time, once again complimenting the "clever girl."
  </p>
  <p key="f43b2208-818a-47bf-a5d0-bd46e499381e">
   XS claimed that Team Flash fully figured out his plan, but Eobard wanted to hear what exactly they figured out. As Flash revealed the plan in detail, Eobard confirmed it all, but also gleefully stated how the two speedsters helped him come up with the plan when they traveled to 2015 and Nora accidentally revealed that their future adversary was Cicada. Eobard then arrogantly declared that he always won due to being the only speedster who's able to manipulate the timeline to fulfill his desires. Furious at Eobard's actions, XS said that they didn't have to have a dagger to stop him. Unfazed by the threat, Eobard accepted the challenge, wanting to see how much Barry taught about being a speedster. He then put on his suit and sped off as Flash and XS pursued him relentlessly.

  <p key="453b4d09-d186-4c2a-805d-66d02ead681e">
   During the chase, the Reverse-Flash somehow created a duplicate of himself, and made it go to a different direction than him in order to separate Flash and XS from each other (by making each of the two speedsters chase after a different version of himself), which also allowed him to manipulate where his enemies run. Using that to his advantage, Reverse-Flash made it so that the two versions of himself will run towards each other on the side of a building, but at the end dodge each other. During the dodge, each version of him hit a different speedster (one version hit the Flash and the other hit XS), which caused them to lose momentum, and due to it happening while running on a side of a building, the two fell to the ground.
  </p>
  <p key="451e9d04-d05b-42e7-8113-8ee141183ca9">
   Reverse-Flash then connected his splintered versions into one, and pointed out that Flash is not a good teacher like him. Due to the

   in 2024, Reverse-Flash tells XS that Flash will always vanish, before declaring that that is his nemesis's legacy. He began running towards the two, but suddenly a Time Sphere came and hit him, which made him fall to the ground. Reverse-Flash turned around, and noticed Team Flash standing in front of him, getting ready to take him down.
  </p>
  <p key="deb0d706-0965-4519-9b09-8f493949d1a1">
   However, Reverse-Flash was still unfazed. He felt nostalgic over the team he created years ago being together again, and then preceded to talk about each member. He first noticed Elongated Man who he welcomed as the "new guy" but pointed out he is supposed to be dead (because of the particle accelerator explosion in 2014 but survived due to timeline changes). Elongated Man simply said that it's something they both have in common, which made Reverse-Flash chuckle and declare that Ralph will soon die anyway. He then mentioned how it's always a pleasure to see Iris, before greeting
   Killer Frost
   (Caitlin's alter ego) whose eyes turn white in anger, as he simply smiled. At last, he talked to Vibe, mentioning how happy he is to see after so long. Reverse-Flash also sarcastically apologized for phasing his arm through back in an erased timeline from 2015, but pointed out it led to his son-esque protégé's discovery of powers to be extraordinary, to which Vibe said not needing powers to be extraordinary.

  <p key="79bfab77-0b76-4379-b7c4-dd25cdb11d8f">
   Reverse-Flash simply smiled, before rushing towards the team, about to kill them all. But Vibe quickly opened a portal which Reverse-Flash accidentally ran into. Vibe opened it back behind then, and as Reverse-Flash got out of it, Killer Frost attacked him with a cold blast, which stopped him from running. As he tried to fight the blast, Iris shot him from the side right into another portal Vibe created. Vibe then opened the portal in the air, making Reverse-Flash fall right into Elongated Man's large hand which punched the speedster far into the air. Vibe then opened another portal, to which Flash and XS ran into. Reverse-Flash fell on the ground, and when he got up, he got punched by the two speedsters who gathered enough speed inside the portal in order to perform a super-sonic punch.

   After the hard beating he got, XS grabbed Eobard by the neck, removed his mask and told him that his legacy is the one which is gonna disappear and not Flash's. XS reconnected to the Negative Speed Force and was about to phase a hand through Eobard's heart and kill him, as Barry and Iris shouted trying to stop but suddenly Nora's hands began to shutter, as Eobard mentioned how close it was.

  <p key="36a23f86-1d1d-442c-ad2a-0b494577c9cc">
   As Nora wasn't understanding what's happening, Eobard explained that there's a new timeline, created when the team destroyed Cicada's dagger, trying to take over which makes Nora slowly disappear from existence. He quickly apologized for being responsible for Nora's erasure from existence but said that he had to make sure he gets his freedom. Angry about Eobard for only caring about himself and the fact Nora is fading because of him, Flash rushed to him, holding Eobard by the neck. Eobard then explained that Flash can still save Nora by getting Nora to the Negative Speed Force, which is the only place in the multiverse that is immune to timeline changes.

  <p key="e816612e-303c-456e-8d2e-1075d4c73b26">
   Noticing that Flash hesitates, Eobard tried to convince this at all cost and mentioned that the two will lose Nora forever if Flash doesn't decide. Noticing how surprised Barry is, Eobard explained that he had grown fond of Nora too and that he truly considered Nora like a daughter, which made Flash angrier. Knowing that Barry would let him go in order to save Nora, Eobard says that he'll see his nemesis in their next crisis. As expected, Barry and Nora ran away, and Eobard smiled as Iris looked at him, with Eobard then proceeding to flee the scene.
  </p>
  <p key="be462f76-6904-4290-8565-961c41d7761f">
   At some point after this, Eobard somehow learned Nora was never saved by Barry and was erased from existence.

While Eobard was still present in the version of the crisis that happened in his personal timeline set in 2024 before he and the Flash's fight in the Allen residence, the timeline changes caused the date to be moved from 2024 to 2019, as well as Eobard's younger self instead fighting against the Flash,

   Due to the emergency of the situation the Godspeed war was causing, Barry and Iris had the Speed Force (as Nora Allen) use Eobard as a trump card in order to stop
   August Heart
   , who recently recovered his memories and speed - because of his connection to the Negative Speed Force, Eobard couldn't have his speed siphoned by Godspeed. For this reason, the Speed Force connected to the Negative Speed Force and reconstituted Eobard's body. As soon as he regained his physical form, Eobard ran directly into Godspeed, projecting him few blocks away. the Reverse-Flash then greeted the Flash and helped back to his feet, and they teamed up against August. With all three speedsters fighting with lightning swords, the speedster battle eventually came to a point where they were able to whittle down August's focus - August knocked down Barry with a surprise sonic boom, and in the short time August was distracted, Eobard used his lightning sword to impale August.

  <p key="934a5251-b479-4265-8e94-7f874a54e5fa">
   Fearful that Eobard might have killed August, Barry rushed to check August's vitals and was relieved to find he was merely unconscious. Barry scolded Eobard, claiming that he could have killed him, although Eobard reasoned that, knowing him, Barry should've been prepared for that possibility when his team reached out to Eobard for help. With August unconscious, Eobard was eager to have a showdown with Barry again, but Barry warned him to walk away. In defiance, Eobard tried to punch Barry at superspeed, only to find himself thrown as Barry tapped into
   Flashtime
   . Surprised that Barry was now faster than him and that they were no longer equals, Eobard angrily asked Barry how he got faster - Eobard mentored his nemesis and taught Barry everything he knew. Barry only responded that he got faster and was mildly amused when Eobard sadly admitted he hadn't gotten faster. Though pained by this revelation, the determined Eobard told Barry to mark his words that he would return once he found out how to get faster, before speeding off.

   After his last enounter with the Flash,
   the humiliating defeat after they finished Godspeed,
   it was clear to Thawne he was no longer fast enough to defeat his nemesis.
   So, he began tapping into the

   in order to do things that would ultimately cause
   Armageddon
   . Some of it includes framing Barry for being associated with

   Central City

   Speed Force
   chose him to be struck by lightning, which led to him becoming the leader of
   Team Flash

   Sometime later, when Barry and
   Damien Darhk
   planned to go back in time and fix things, Eobard confronted Barry again as he tried to convince Iris and tell her the truth, only for Eobard to be temporary paralyzed by Iris. Then, Flash and Reverse-Flash ran across the world, thus causing Armageddon and nearly destroying it. But, due to Iris helping Barry reconnect with the Speed Force, Eobard ultimately lost and the timeline was reset.

   Transported into custody at S.T.A.R. Labs, he was placed into a forcefield to both monitor his condition and make sure he doesn't hurt anyone. As Team Flash and Mia discussed about what to do about Eobard, he was visited by
   Caitlin
   who made him know that he had 2 hours before he would be erased. Gloating about her being with Team Flash and the fact that she could have lived in a future with her fiancé
   Ronnie Raymond
   , he claimed to be sure that Caitlin wouldn't let him die because she's a doctor and noted that she could've moved on but instead she stayed with Team Flash. However, Caitlin replied back to Eobard's provocations, remarking that she hated him for 8 years because of Eobard's being responsible for Ronnie's death.

   After Caitlin's confrontation, Barry confronted Eobard and asked why he created a Reverse-Flashpoint just to steal Barry's life. Eobard revealed that almost 2 centuries from now, he met the Flash for the first time (possibly in the original timeline before Eobard changed it in 2000 or due to time travel), finally discovering ways to possess speed. As he was about to reveal himself as the fastest man alive, the Flash instead came to save a crowd, which angered Eobard as he claimed that he "stole his greatest moment" and humiliated him despite admiring the Flash. While Barry told Eobard that he's just a sociopath, "reacting to something so small with that kind of rage", the latter replied back that he called that rage "commitment" and would try to find new ways to kill Barry if he saves him.

   As Team Flash, Mia, and

After Despero was defeated by Barry, Eobard had only 30 seconds before he was erased from existence. Barry then used his lightning to sever Eobard's connection to the
   Negative Speed Force
   , saving him. However, Eobard angrily and sadly yelled at Barry for taking his life and leaving him in hell. He was then transported to an
   A.R.G.U.S.

     In the event of his death, Eobard arranged for Barry to inherit S.T.A.R. Labs. Eobard's actions continued to affect Barry, feeling guilty for Eddie's and Ronnie's deaths, but also blaming Eobard for causing them. Six months later, Barry received Eobard's video will message.
     Eobard's actions left Barry tormented and believed maybe he was right in never truly being happy as Eobard did know the Flash's future self, however, Joe thought this was just Eobard trying to have the last word.
     While Barry did still hate Eobard for everything he did, Barry eventually chose to forgive him, not wanting to hate him anymore
     (though he would later tell Eobard he hated him, prompted by Eobard showing joy at being able to kill Barry's mother).
     Eobard's future actions also dictated his younger self's actions when he arrived in 2016 for the first time and learned many important facts about his future he'd later exploit.
     Barry later did realize (despite all he did) that Eobard truly was a father figure to the team.
     Additionally, Eobard's actions remained a source of trauma for Cisco, particularly the instance from the erased timeline where he killed Cisco by vibrating his hand through his chest.

    <p key="27fb3c29-2deb-4344-9246-c36b06394025">
     Eobard's deception made Barry initially skeptical to trust Hunter. While Team Flash trusted Hunter, Barry didn't, believing Hunter too also sought to exploit Barry's speed for Hunter's personal gain just like Eobard, despite Hunter's claims of wanting to help them against the evil speedster Zoom. Iris convinced Barry that not everyone is like Eobard and to not be distrusting people because of that experience, and would subsequently trust the Flash of Earth-2.
     Unfortunately, Team Flash would later discover that Hunter actually was Zoom all along and there to exploit the Flash's powers for his own use, thus Barry blamed himself believing Hunter's facade and should have known better after Eobard's impersonation.
     Hunter also learned of Eobard's actions, murdering Henry in the same place Eobard murdered Nora to enrage Barry.
     This would also play a part in Barry creating

     Eobard's various actions completely destroyed the reputation of Wells to the public. Since his deception was known only to Team Flash and several of their allies, this made it hard for multiverse doppelgängers of Wells to be on Earth-1. However, Team Flash continually ignored the fact that Eobard was merely an impostor, a fact that Caitlin seemed to remember while the doppelgängers get forced to continually be reminded of. Team Flash was initially skeptical to trust Harry of Earth-2, believing Harry too was evil like Eobard. Barry was ironically more open-minded to trusting Harry than the rest, especially Cisco and Joe, despite Harry's face being a reminder of Eobard's betrayal.
     As
     Grodd
     continued to grow in intelligence and size, Harry used the second Reverse-Flash suit to impersonate Eobard in order to save Caitlin from Grodd.
     Eventually, Team Flash realized that Harry is inconsiderate and blunt but not evil like Eobard was.
     Harry often found himself targeted by other people who weren't aware of Eobard's deception. Eobard's façade indirectly led to
     Patty Spivot
     's shooting of Harry with Hunter's timely intervention with the use of the
     Velocity serums
     saving Harry's life.
     Harry later gets kidnapped by
     Griffin Grey
     mistaking Harry for Eobard trying to force to develop a cure for the meta-human condition.
     While Team Flash gets more open minded about welcoming
     H.R. Wells
     of
     Earth-19
     , Eobard's actions initially made Cisco distrustful of H.R.
     Although highly irritated that Team Flash neglected to be informed of Eobard's façade beforehand, H.R. used a facial transmogrification device to be disguised as
     Randolf Morgan
     to remedy the problem.

     When Barry was infected by

     In Eobard's younger years, he was petty, somewhat short tempered and unstable, when
     <a href="Barry Allen (Earth-1).html" key="bf427f7d-2070-44b4-9508-d5ab85ad297a" title="Barry Allen (Earth-1)">
      Barry Allen

     found out Eobard's hatred was because he couldn't be just like the Flash, Barry expressed disgust, causing Eobard to snap, yelling that he's "become better than" the Flash (arrogantly) stating that he is the one individual that his nemesis can't stop. Learning that he caused; such pain and sorrow later in the Flash's life made Eobard giddy and proud of his life choices as the Flash's nemesis.
    </p>
    <p key="eb72b3ea-4c59-4b41-9124-46c974ba66ce">
     Although polite, Eobard is proven to be quite arrogant, self-righteous, overconfident, somewhat cruel and sadistic, these traits were evident during his first encounter with the Flash with Eobard believing the Flash couldn't keep up with him, despite his superior speed, Eobard gets outsmarted, beaten unconscious and imprisoned, upon meeting
     Cisco Ramon
     for the first time, Eobard is impressed by Cisco's powers, even curious, maintaining politeness for the most part. But he still smirked with sarcasm when Cisco taunted him of his imprisonment. Eobard is shown to take great joy in mocking his enemies for their own actions' fallout, demonstrated when
     Harry Wells
     came to free him to be sent back to his own time so as to repair the timeline damage.
     Eobard is also seen to justify his murders by stating that those whom he had killed (such as
     Tess Morgan
     ) had already been dead for centuries from his perspective, not caring about his victims or seeing how his acts were harming the timeline.
    </p>
    <p key="dd505e88-0aa0-46c2-99a8-71ed6bb053db">
     In Eobard's younger years, he had a scientific obsession with the Flash; to the point where he reversed engineered the reaction behind his idol's powers to give himself the ability to access the Speed Force, this obsession led Eobard to study the
     Speed Force
     and experiment it's potential after gaining his powers. This eventually led him to develop technologies that not only help enhance his powers but also against other speedsters who oppose him which led him. Through his experiments, he was eventually able to discover his ability to time travel and began abusing this ability to the point where he was mostly unaffected by the changes he made in the past.
    </p>
    <p key="096c4033-a736-4610-8fdc-2468770a5f61">
     Another notable trait is Eobard's deep and insatiable hatred for the Flash. Eobard admitted that he used to be a huge fan of the Flash, going as far as to find out how his hero came to be and how to become like the man, even succeeding in gaining super-speed himself. But realizing that he was fated to be his idol's greatest enemy caused him to go insane with hatred and rage, to the point where he was determined to erase the Flash from existence by going as far as to kill Barry as a child and killing
     Nora Allen
     when he failed to do that, partly out of rage but partly out of his strong desire to ward his former idol off from being the Flash.
    </p>
    It's possible that Eobard's usage of his appearance-stealing cord on the innocent
    Harrison Wells
    would affect his personality along with his genetics as Eobard would later recall with apparent regret how he once felt rage every time he looked upon the Flash.

     Under Eobard's "Dr. Wells" façade, he is a scientific genius responsible for numerous achievements in different fields of science. Wells had a large sense of respect from the scientific community, and was the very genius behind S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator's existence that orchestrated the accident behind

     Distancing his "old contacts" (such as
     Tina McGee
     ) and focusing on the particle accelerator's creation made them suspect that he's not the same man, but there was nothing definite to support this assumption.
     Ultimately, he seemed to appear somewhat tortured, a combination of "losing" Tess Morgan,
     and the number of people killed because of the particle accelerator.

    <p key="660ea5c7-3782-46a9-9efe-b50bf1412e41">
     Eobard is a character of dual-identities towards
     Team Flash
     and himself as he openly appears caring and compassionate, guiding Barry's journey as the Flash, but had been proven to be willing to kill to ensure Barry's safety,
     and willing to sacrifice the meta-human prisoners to ensure this protection,
     Eobard is also willing to sacrifice other people with the particle accelerator's activation after being warned of a possible malfunction at Central City's risk, all to ensure Barry would be struck by the lightning bolt to turn into the Flash.

    <p key="097f471f-23a2-4d35-bd37-d78125ccca32">
     Eobard is proven to be a very secretive man, as neither
     Cisco Ramon
     nor
     Caitlin Snow
     had ever visited his house,
     and had either killed or manipulated individuals to their deaths,
     however, he did seem to care about Team Flash's life, as he seemed nearly gave up his own life, he was willing to confront
     Farooq Gibran
     in a bid to divert him from attacking Barry, Cisco and Caitlin,
     and protected
     Grodd
     from being tortured by
     Wade Eiling
     's inhumane experiments,
     despite at first being tempted to kill
     Firestorm
     , Eobard decided to help separate him into two individuals again, this can be either from the fact that killing
     Ronnie Raymond
     would cost Eobard the trust and respect of Barry, Cisco and Caitlin or the fact he genuinely had a change of heart. However, he had no initial problem giving up
     Martin Stein
     to Eiling and used this as an opportunity to re-fuse Firestorm.
     Though he is able to fool those who know him to an extent, he is not flawless in his deceptions as Tina could detect that he became a "different person" ever since Tess's death.
    </p>
    <p key="3e7b523e-3ece-41d9-8505-ca0e2495d69f">
     Eobard can be seen as a man of sophistication as a man of the finer things in life, such as his own private collection of scotch, showing an interest in classical orchestra and was able to fluently speak in Latin, a trait he shared with
     Hartley Rathaway
     .
    </p>
    <p key="e54085f9-aeee-4025-a6d5-d2c0065149b4">
     Due to Eobard hiding behind his Wells identity, he adapted and evolved every situation to better suit his agenda under his disguise and being Wells himself for 15 years, Eobard has become even more skilled at plotting and manipulating since his time-traveling years, coming close to believing his own lies, he presents himself as a kind, humbled benefactor, even that is extensive to what situation better suits his multi-layered personality and he is more than capable of acting ruthlessly pragmatic to one which requires such behavior, even sometimes in front of his teammates. He rarely killed directly but preferred to silently bend others and systematically destroy any threats to his designs or life using his vast intelligence.
    </p>
    <p key="92788090-e33b-49e4-8cd0-c075952a20ad">
     Despite the genetic makeup and physical appearance of Wells, Eobard remained somewhat sadistic and unstable, as seen by his numerous threats towards
     Joe West
     where
     Iris West
     would be in danger or Barry with the rest of Barry's loved ones whenever his plans started to fail, attempting to kill seemingly on a whim.
     He also continued to take great joy in mocking his enemies for their vain attempts to stop him and not understanding his plans, demonstrated with
     Hannibal Bates
     's impersonation and his reactivation of the particle accelerator.
     He expressed a bit of remorse for some of these murders (as seen with
     Simon Stagg
     ), though he is seen to justify his murders by stating that those whom he had killed had already been dead for centuries from his perspective (as seen by his killing of Cisco). Ultimately, there wasn't enough to dissuade him from returning to his own time by any means necessary, as Eobard killed Cisco due to finding out his secret despite viewing Cisco as a son.
     Surprisingly, Eobard had an evidently calm attitude toward his situation. After discovering the only way to return to his timeline was to create a man who he once felt pure loathing, he found the situation almost laughably ironic, claiming this is fate's way to spite him one last time as the only reason he traveled through time was with the sole purpose of killing the youth that became his protégé.
    </p>
    <p key="2cf26898-20f3-45e2-b0f1-33bc9222a230">
     Eobard seemed exasperated upon learning Barry had accidentally time-traveled and was stopping certain events from happening, telling Barry to let everything happen the same way because the changes could be cataclysmic.
     Eobard expressed great fear of
     <a href="Time Wraiths.html" key="64fdfe2a-ad0a-43da-82bf-9a717c46851b" title="Time Wraiths">
      Time Wraiths
     </a>
     , explaining how he was careful to avoid them when changing the timeline.
     However, seeing as another version of Eobard would later go on to cause several changes to history when being chased by the
     Black Flash
     , it can be inferred that he does not inherently care if the timeline is altered and only disapproves of it when it could endanger his life or affect his plans.
    </p>
    <p key="7d291b7d-f755-40f1-97e2-3292e7cbc794">
     When Eobard's real personality was revealed to Team Flash, he stated that everything he has done has made his own team's lives better, despite the fact that he had been selfishly using Barry to get back to his own time, and both Cisco and Caitlin were pariahs from the particle accelerator incident. This proves that even after 15 years hiding behind a different identity, he remains a self-righteous sociopath who tries to justify his immoral actions.
     Another example is when Eobard found out that he killed Cisco in an erased timeline but didn't care nor felt sorry because he was certain he had a good reason for doing so. Despite this, he still appeared to consider Team Flash his friends and allies, or at least he spoke to them in a casual tone as if they were. In his final moments he called out for Cisco to help him as he was being erased from existence, despite knowing Cisco hated him at that point.

    <p key="fc45d950-8950-4ecb-9934-6c3613f89572">
     Eobard seems to have contempt towards
     Eddie Thawne
     , after revealing their relation to Eddie, Eobard made it clear that Eddie wasn't killed because it would risk his own existence,
     Eobard viewed Eddie with condescension as history had virtually no record of Eddie, unlike the distinguished politicians, scientists and captains of industry that are Eddie's descendants and Eobard's ancestors.
     Ironically, Eddie's suicide means that Eobard was defeated by someone he viewed as inferior.
     Thus, Eobard's self-importance could be considered his fatal flaw, as he told Eddie of their relation just so he could insult him and and compare him to himself.
    </p>
    <p key="c31ec45a-065b-4088-b479-5fad1b61aea0">
     Eobard can be very laid-back about what happens to him, although this usually happened when he believed that his plan will not be affected, even when confronted with the combined forces of the Flash,

     He also displays this apparent confront almost the entire time being thrown into the Pipeline anyway while displaying his plans to S.T.A.R. Labs to help him return to his own time.

    <p key="f8a1303f-5e5d-4c25-b19b-628099ec49c2">
     While Eobard originally hated the Flash, he came to see Barry as little more than a means to an end but he grew to care for his protégé to look after as a student, and (in some ways) even as a son, Eobard believed that he could understand and empathize with the paternal love that Joe and
     Henry Allen
     had for Barry, initially disgusting his former protégé,
     though Barry later admitted Eobard may have been genuine.
     In spite of this, Eobard's pent-up rage and hatred for the Flash seemingly resurfaced when Barry reneged on their deal to go back in time to save Nora and Eobard returning to his own time in the future. This was evident when Eobard violently pummeled Barry just before vowing to kill not only the Flash but Barry's friends and Henry too had Eddie's suicide not erased the lives of Eddie's descendants that were also supposed to be Eobard's ancestors. Although seemingly calmed down shortly before fading from existence, he still used his last seconds to mock Barry about how his nemesis would get on and survive without him there to control.
    </p>
    <p key="683125b2-4519-4621-acbb-a1f5472dd249">
     In Eobard's will, he thought that Barry would never truly be happy, implying that his disdain for Barry may have never went away completely, yet he also acknowledged that the two of them were never truly enemies, and as a favor, he confessed to Nora's murder which freed Henry from prison and allowed Barry to inherit S.T.A.R Labs officially. This final, posthumuous act proves that Eobard does have honor in him in spite of all his villainous traits and displays that he on a certain level (genuinely) cared about Barry's well-being.
    </p>
    Suffice it to say, Eobard had an extremely complex psychological makeup, with an adaptable and malleable nature, he ranged from being a self-focused and egotistical sociopath of the highest order, to a truly compassionate and honorable man in his later years, albeit with a very twisted sense of honor. Overall, he was a very morally gray man, much less the monster that many people tend to see him as, and had proved himself as a very tortured man, cursed to fight his own hero and become the man's enemy. Ultimately, his motivation for all the good and evil he has done throughout 15 years was claimed to be a return to his old life in the 22nd century, to leave the "barbaric" 21st century and come back to the people he cared about. In moments of desperation when it seemed his plan had failed, he quickly instantly become enraged and would have no problem resorting to straight-up murder.

Hypocritically, he referred to Barry as "the villain" and chastised Barry for changing time despite Barry's actions being an attempt to fix the wrongs of Eobard's timeline alterations in the first place.

     Unwilling to let anything stand in his way, Eobard would cause multiple historical
     aberrations
     for the
     Legends
     to clean up on his quest to find the Spear of Destiny. Eobard displayed a willingness to work with various terrorists/criminals, such as
     Damien Darhk
     ,
     <a href="Malcolm Merlyn.html" key="3792958a-d163-41b3-ba6e-b43e85b7b5e0" title="Malcolm Merlyn">

     Leonard Snart

     He had fallen so low on morals that he had zero compunctions about allying with, and later double-crossing or even slaying the Nazis in 1942 with his own hands, furthermore, it was Eobard who assisted with
     Damien Darhk
     's and
     Adolf Hitler
     's plans to nuke New York City in the first place for no discernible reason other than the possibility of gaining a part of the Askaran Amulet.
     He was also ready to provide Nazi Germany with his meta-human biomolecular enhancer that could allow the Nazis to win the war, all just to get a part of the Askaran Amulet from
     Baron Krieger
     . Seeing as he had previously clashed with
     Rex Tyler
     in multiple variations of the timeline, Eobard did not care for the timeline damage that killing Rex preemptively would cause.
     On the other hand, Eobard modified his appearance-stealing cord to allow his identity theft victims (such as
     Martin Stein
     and
     John Swigert
     ) to stay alive, although his reasoning for this is unknown.
     It's possible that, like the previous version of himself, Eobard justified his actions by the fact that his victims had been "dead for centuries" from his point of view.
    </p>
    <p key="22ccac9c-1240-4224-bd43-997d72b64ce0">
     Armed with the knowledge of possible futures, Eobard would display great pride and cockiness, creating an aura of the all-knowing mastermind around himself to both his enemies and his allies, goading Damien Darhk for more than forty years before finally revealing the possibility to change Damien's unlucky fate,
     acting condescending towards Malcolm, yet amused at how a "pretty face" knows of the Askaran Amulet's lore,
     and thinking of Legends as being beneath his intelligence, often calling them "idiots" and other similar names.
     He would also display himself eager to tell others of his knowledge of history and myths, detailing how the Askaran Amulet would help his allies find the Spear of Destiny.
     Eobard's downfall came from him making decisions based on pride and arrogance, such as choosing to keep the Legends in existence in the
     rewritten reality
     and ultimately not wearing his watch that would have alerted him of the Black Flash's presence.

    <p key="d2e603b1-8fcb-4a13-bddc-9b5a9552a001">
     Eobard would often toy with his enemies, and his more twisted and demented demeanor was the most direct against Barry. He laughed insanely upon realizing that he had somehow avoided Flashpoint's dangers in his heroic counterpart's crude prison cell, and ultimately, he took great pleasure in tormenting Barry when he was released for the timeline to be "restored" (despite the previous timeline also being a product of Eobard's machinations).
     Eobard would also taunt the Legends, displaying the group how easy it would be to slaughter them all at his full power, as he directly threatened to kill
     Jefferson Jackson
     and
     Amaya Jiwe
     ,
     but then showed mercy to the Legends and his own rebelling co-conspirators in their new reality to serve as a means of punishing their defiance by forcing them to be trapped and powerless, while telling his mutineers to "remember this mercy,"
     and later killing the Legends' alternate timeline versions.

     Despite Eobard's arrogant and overconfident traits, as a remorseless murderer and sociopath, he also displayed a more contemplative, philosophical side with a certain degree of humanity. As he was met with another declaration of hate from Barry, Eobard replied that he too hates the Flash yet sometimes he wonders just which speedster is in the right, possibly implying some hidden reasons to hate his nemesis that are much more grievous than those claimed by his younger-self.
     Eobard would also claim to have fond memories of his alternate-self's work alongside
     Caitlin Snow
     and
     Cisco Ramon
     , and did not see himself as an absolute monster in comparison with the monsters he has witnessed throughout centuries that he's seen through time travel, commenting on this to
     Ray Palmer
     .
     Eobard is also not without fear, as he viewed
     Hunter Zolomon
     (Black Flash) as a beast worse than even the Time Wraiths.
     He was proven to be in true terror, describing Black Flash as "one of history's worst monsters." With the knowledge of his ancestor's suicide and his own mortality, Eobard now no longer wanted to best the Flash, but to simply to continue living.
    </p>
    In the rewritten reality, Eobard successfully stopped global warming, the melting of ice caps and the extinction of the polar bears, and became the most powerful man in this reality, greatly enjoying all of this while leading Central City at S.T.A.R. Labs without having to pretend to be Wells.
    However, the rewritten reality had all of the various heroes (including the Flash) killed off, and the Black Flash remained intact, although imprisoned by Eobard.
    Unlike the previous version of himself whose one goal was to get back to his time, Eobard seemed content in this reality that resembled the 21st century.

     's
     New Reich
     as one of the most focused
     Nazi
     generals. Much like his original form, Eobard proved himself to be vocally contemptuous of others, and he never passed up an opportunity to insult both enemies and allies. He mocked Barry Allen by wearing his Harrison Wells likeness once again just "for old time's sake," and appeared to have a deeper and more focused hatred of the Flash than before.
    </p>
    Although Eobard embraced Nazi despotism and tyranny, he has no true loyalty to either the
    Führer
    or the other Schutzstaffel generals, yet he demanded
    Earth-1
    's conquest to be the New Reich's priority, openly mocking the love and affection between the Führer and
    Overgirl
    , and also thought that
    Tommy Merlyn
    was pathetic.
    Reminiscing at S.T.A.R. Labs, Eobard remembered hating every minute of the 15 years he was trapped in the 21st century
    despite having previously stated how he grew to love working with Team Flash.
    After his confrontation against Barry ended with the Flash's victory, Eobard even dared his nemesis to finally kill him. When Barry declined, Eobard mocked Barry for being "above killing," and wondered what face would he wear in their next meeting, taunting his nemesis.

     After his imprisonment in Iron Heights, Eobard has seemingly reflected on his evil life and felt remorse over his deeds, claiming to be working towards a less villainous legacy. He seemed to be committed in helping his archenemy's daughter,
     Nora West-Allen
     , to stop

     . Eobard expressed guilt, shame, and remorse when Nora furiously confronted him over heartlessly murdering her namesake and tormenting Barry, even if he still believed that his actions helped save her. Eobard even seemed genuinely hurt when Nora stated that he only cared about himself. Despite this, he bore no grudge for Nora's condemnation and quickly agreed to help her when she, much to his pleasure, decided to give him a chance.
    </p>
    <p key="75346a1a-b20e-42b9-8c1f-fb5b021666ea">
     When faced by Barry, Eobard showed no resentment towards his longtime foe, merely trying to put Barry in his place for suggesting he was trying to take away Nora for him by reasoning that he simply granted Nora's wish to see her father again, although he did so mockingly. This suggests that his hatred for Barry has faded, or at least mellowed.

    However, Eobard's true endgame in mentoring and sending Nora to the past was to destroy Cicada's
    dagger
    that was dampening his powers so he could escape his execution. Nevertheless, Eobard had grown genuinely fond of Nora, considering her to be the daughter he had never had; he appeared to be almost proud of Nora's growth as a speedster and was immediately genuinely concerned when she started to fade out of existence; Eobard quickly offered to help by getting Barry to take Nora into the
    Negative Speed Force
    , even going as far as to plead with Barry to save her, apologizing for having indirectly caused Nora to do it. This was also indicated by how Eobard appeared reluctant to have Nora tap into the Negative Speed Force despite it being necessary for his freedom since he was worried it would corrupt her like him. However, while Eobard's ultimate plan was to have Nora establish a Negative Speed Force connection to further his goal to escape, he also wanted give Nora the option to preserve her existence after his plan succeeded.

    In order to take over Nash's body for good, Eobard trapped Nash in his most painful memory of

    Nora West-Allen
    's death, scolding and even yelling at him for not making the most of his time with her whereas Eobard taught her everything he knew. While this implies Eobard feels sorrow over Nora's death, Barry noted he was primarily saying this to gain power over Barry by bringing him emotional pain. However, Nash ultimately overcame Eobard's will with the help of both Cisco and Barry after Cecile put the two in Nash's mind. Eobard was then expelled from Nash's body, having to survive in the form of nothing more than negative tachyons.

     After August was taken down, Eobard was eager to have a showdown with Barry again who (politely) warn him to walk away while he still had the chance; but Eobard (arrogantly) ignores his arch-nemesis' warning and tries to attack him, but much to his embarrassment, he discovers that Barry has finally surpassed him; in terms of "physical speed". Realising that he is no match for the latter's speed superior, Eobard retreated to fight another day.

     After Eobard's last encounter with Barry, he created the
      Reverse-Flashpoint
      timeline not only so that he could usurp Barry's role as the Flash, but also to hurt him as well. However, Eobard underestimated Barry yet again, because he knew that Barry only had a small amount of the
      Speed Force
      's energy lift inside of him, he believed that the latter would not be able to changed the timelin back to normal before he was erase from existence; as he was unable to anticipate that his arch-nemesis would willingly work with
      Damien Darhk
      to prevent the Reverse-Flashpoint timeline from ever happening; proving that even after years of battling against Barry, he is not only incapable of acknowledging his mistakes, but he is also incapable of learning from them as well.

     After Eobard discovered that he was being erase from existence by the timeline itself; as a result of Barry utilising the
      particle eradication distributor
      to prevent the Reverse-Flashpoint timeline ever happening, he had the audacity to ask
      Team Flash
      to save his life, which Eobard does not deserve; proving that he always puts his his own self-preservation before his own selfish goals.

     After Barry demanded to know why Eobard despises him so much, he revealed that the main reason why he hates Barry; isn’t because of what he learned from the
      Flash Museum
      ; that he was destined to become one of the Flash's greatest enemies, as he could never become like his arch-nemesis.

    <p key="ae5add7d-d582-4b9c-8022-7995e773bae8">
     It was because of what happened in the original timeline of the original multiverse of the 22nd century; which was the first time that Barry and Eobard had actually met each other, after Eobard had gained enough tremendous speed, he was going to reveal his existence as a speedster to crowd, but future Barry beat him to it and saved the crowd from an unknown disaster, stealing his moment of glory; this is the main reason why he despises Barry so much; completely disregarding the fact that future Barry was not actually trying to upstage him; proving just how sociopathic and delusional he truly is.
    </p>
    After Barry severed Eobard's connection to the
     Negative Speed Force
     , saving him from being erase from existence, but instead of being grateful towards Barry for saving his life, he instead criticised the latter by stating that; "my speed is my life, you took my life and left me in hell".

      Later, after somehow returning from erasure, his speed also somehow increased considerably, able to keep up with the Flash of 2017 who was described as the fastest speedster ever.
      However, Eobard also stated that his speed was equal to the Flash of 2024's speed,

          By shifting momentarily back in time, Eobard is able to "create" a time remnant. As each one is as real as the other, it allows Eobard to overwhelm his enemies with multiple copies of himself. It also protected him from any alterations to the timeline and secures his existence when he shouldn't exist by becoming a Time Remnant himself. As a Time Remnant he was also able to create his own Time Remnants, but they a merely extensions of himself and under his direct control, as evident when Black Flash erased Eobard from existence, all his time remnants phased out of existence shortly after him.

Eobard also has knowledge relating to mystical artifacts. He knew that the

His knowledge and understanding about the Speed Force seems to be among the greatest (if not the greatest) among the speedsters due to him being from the future.

Whereas the novice Flash from 2014-2015 relied primarily on speed to overwhelm slower opponents with random striking, the older Eobard proved to be a very methodical combatant, using his speed to seamlessly and quickly strike at precise spots to systemically wear down his opponent.

When in Nash's body and not having his powers, Eobard was still able to outfight Cisco, easily knocking him down and restraining him and breaking out of his grip after being hit and tackling him to a table and ultimately subduing him after easily blocking his attack upon being kicked away.

    </a>
    's greatest enemies, as he could never become like his then-idol, he developed an (irrational/unjustified) hatred towards Barry Allen. This hatred was further intensified when Eobard was prepared to reveal his existence as a speedster to a crowd in the 22nd century after he had gained enough tremendous speed; which was the first time that Barry and Eobard met each other in real time, however, the scarlet speedster beat him, saving the crowd from an unknown disaster and thus; stealing his moment of glory; albeit that Barry had no intention or desire to upstage him. Since that moment - he became obsessed with trying to destroy Barry's life - spurred on by the grandiose belief that he is superior to the latter. In truth, Eobard lacks any form of morals or honor, all traits that his arch-nemesis stands for. Eobard has a habit of underestimating his opponents - despite years of battling against Barry, he still underestimates the scarlet speedster - which has led to several of his downfalls at the latter's hands. Eobard's obsession with trying to destroy Barry's life almost costs him his own life. After Eobard created the

     Irregular gravity:

    Eobard is unable to access his speed while in space or on the moon. While Ray suggests this is because of the lack of gravity, Eobard is still unable to phase or vibrate himself while tied up on the moon, which does possess a gravitational force. However, this may simply be because of the differing gravitational forces of Earth and the moon, meaning that Eobard would be able to phase in that particular level of gravity. Also, he needed to manually restore his normal appearance with the appearance-stealing cord instead of vibrating on his own power. He can however still access his speed and phasing abilities to their fullest effect when Earth-level gravity is artificially replicated (e.g. on the

     Time alterations:

    While willing to make huge leaps through time and likewise meddle with events,
    Eobard has a great fear of time manipulation done recklessly by others.
    This is due to the existence of the

    who act as guardians to the Speed Force's energy.
    While existing as a time remnant as his past self was erased from existence, Eobard was forced to constantly run, even through the timeline itself, to avoid getting killed by the relentless hunting of the Black Flash, of which Eobard was utterly terrified of facing.
    After his return from some unknown place, Eobard seemed to have solved his problem with the Black Flash, as he appeared nonchalant when confronted about his previous erasure.
    He claimed to discover that "the timeline is malleable" and was able to predict the timeline with ease.
    However, because of the
    time stone
    's ability to nullify any time variables, he began to slowly fade away from existence when the stone was used.

    Due the fact that all of Eobard's powers comes from his connection to the Speed Force; if he becomes disconnected from it in any way; he will lose all of his powers. However, after Eobard discovered that he was destined to become one of Barry Allen's greatest enemies, he created his own
    negative version
    of the Speed Force, thus; Eobard severed his own connection to the Speed Force.

     Speed Force connection flux:
    </b>
    According to
    Gideon
    ; Eobard severely damaged his connection to the Speed Force from having traveled back in time and killed Barry's mother,
    Nora Allen
    . Even when Eobard's ancestor Eddie committed suicide to wipe Eobard out of existence, the Negative Speed Force continued to exist despite Eobard being the creator, so this implies the Negative Speed Force truly is immune to timeline changes as Thawne said. While later regaining his super speed and most of its related powers due to setting the timeline back on course through the particle accelerator explosion leading to Barry becoming the Flash, he still lacked a stable connection to the Speed Force, rendering him unable to travel through time and stranded in the distant past. At the same time, his recovered speed was unstable, randomly working, and also appeared to affect his ability to walk. To compensate somewhat, Eobard relied on the tachyon prototype to stabilize his powers for a longer duration. However, the version that had existed after the Flashpoint timeline never experienced these damaging events, thus is able to use his powers to their fullest with ease. Later, the original version who wore Harrison Wells's appearance somehow managed stabilize his connection.

     Lack of physical form:
    </b>
    As negative tachyons, Eobard does not have a stable form and has to possess a person to remain stable as well as the connection to the Negative Speed Force. In addition, when he possesses someone, he has to make them fully give in to their negative emotions (such as Nash Wells's despair and guilt over losing Maya) in order to completely take over their body. Until he's fully taken over his host, he cannot access the Negative Speed Force.
    However, since the Speed Force gave him back his body, he doesn't need to find a host again.
