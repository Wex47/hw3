   Allegra Garcia was born on February 23, 1999 in
   Central City
   , into a family of criminals. Her
   father
   walked out on her when she was a baby.
   Following in her family's footsteps, Allegra became a juvenile delinquent and was frequently in and out of juvenile facilities for committing various crimes. At the age of 13, she was once arrested by detective

   On the night of December 11, 2013, Allegra got into a fight with her cousin,

   Particle Accelerator
   exploded and its energy surged across
   Central City
   . Allegra and Esperanza were blasted with the waves of the
   dark matter
   , giving them the same powers of electromagnetic manipulation, though Esperanza was presumed dead from the blast. When Allegra's powers were discovered, she was eventually transferred to the
   Meta-human

  <p key="ed77ef5a-4060-4cf5-ade4-216374d2465c">
   Allegra believed that her cousin was still alive, due to a series of murders that involved people being burnt to death with pure UV radiation. A witness of one of the murders noticed the tattoo on Esperanza's neck which Allegra had a matching ratio of;  as a result, Allegra was mistakenly arrested by
   CCPD
   . Given no one would believe her hunches about her cousin being alive, she decided to plead guilty. She was almost charged with the max sentence of all crimes committed until
   Cecile Horton
   sensed she wasn't guilty with her empathic abilities and held off further prosecution and told Judge
   Hankerson
   she had new evidence to stall until she knew the truth. Allegra eventually made bail.

   Shortly after Allegra made bail she broke out of her
   meta cuffs
   and later went to the witness who claimed to have seen her at the scene of the crime due to Allegra and her cousin sharing the same tattoo. She went to the witness' apartment only to find him dead with ultraviolet burn covering his face. She was later seen by
   Iris West-Allen
   and

   in the apartment when they were also visiting the witness for an interview. Allegra in a panic accidentally blasted Ralph in the face with UV Blast and ran but was later caught by Joe West and arrested for a parole violation. Allegra later tried to explain to Joe that she didn't murder the witness and was only trying to talk to him in an attempt to prove her innocence. She was later approached by Cecile who demanded to know who killed the victims but Allegra refused as she believed they wouldn't believe her if she told them and asked for her lawyer.
  </p>
  <p key="750ffa0f-9270-49a5-bd51-96d883a66913">
   During interrogation Cecile opened up to Allegra about her empathetic abilities and as a result, Allegra finally opened up to Cecile about the night she got powers and revealed that her cousin was also hit and that she was convinced she was dead but also thinks she may have committed those crimes as the witness ID'd her off a tattoo she and her cousin shared though she was in doubt and said it was impossible. Cecile later contacted Iris and Ralph to check the juvenile records they had and see if they can pull up any file on Esperanza and they discovered she had been taken out of the custody of the juvenile facility and transferred to a very redacted organization revealing she had been alive the entire time. Shortly after Iris tried to warn Cecile their phone call was interrupted by an EMP causing the power at CCPD to go out. Esperanza attacked the officers are CCPD demanding they bring her Allegra or they would all burn. Cecile and Allegra later tried to escape but was later stopped by Esperanza. Allegra tried to convince Esperanza to stop and that she wasn't being herself. Esperanza confirmed her statement and said she only goes by the name Ultraviolet. She was unable to get through to her cousin. Cecile guarded Allegra and confronted Esperanza and told her she wouldn't let her hurt Allegra. They were almost blasted by Esperanza until

   talking with the new Wells which made her angrily quit Central City Citizen as a result of learning that Iris lied to her about what would've potentially been a big story for her. Iris confronts her about it and explains that she will eventually tell the truth but not now. Allegra then decided to stay instead of quitting.

The man introduces himself as Nash Wells and is searching for something that emits ultraviolet. His device eventually makes him deduce that the "something" was, in fact, someone since it makes him aware that Allegra is a Meta-human that can emit ultraviolet. Nash tells Allegra that if she helps him, he will give her the scoop of the century. Later, in the sewers, Allegra is impressed by the story of

   Eventually, Allegra told the truth when Barry asked about Frost after Chester had discovered that the ice had artificial dark matter. She accompanied the Flash to find Frost at her old job and saw that she had defeated
   Chillblaine
   in battle. Allegra used her powers to free Frost's eyes from the "snow-blindness" that the villain had caused her. When the Meta-human Task Force arrived to arrest Frost, Allegra suggested that Frost goes on the run, but Frost explained to her young friend that she was not about to sullen the reputation of Team Flash by making them harbor a fugitive any longer. Allegra watched as Frost surrendered to the authorities.

But, the man showing the footage explained why it wasn't complete. After seeing the whole footage they saw they were wrong, making Iris sad. Allegra, to help Iris, brought some papers.

    While unmentioned directly, Allegra has a visible crush on

     Sue Dearbon
     when she told Chester that, because Allegra likes him, she would listen to him. Throughout the remainder of the seventh season, that crush has become more obvious as Chester and Allegra have grown closer.

     is the daughter of the supervillain

      Allegra was from Brazil in the DC comics and she was changed to be Hispanic on the show, despite her name still being spelled the same way. In Spanish, two Ls together make a Y sound, so with the spelling on the show it would be pronounced "Ayegra". This wouldn’t be the case if the show had retained her Brazilian origin.

    when brothers

     were hit by the dark matter at the same time, resulting in them both having atmokinetic abilities just as Allegra and Esperanza developed radiogenetic abilities.

      However, in the Mardon brothers' case, Mark's powers were far more precies and potent than Clyde's, whereas Allegra's and Esperanza's powers appear to be virtually identical.
