   after the
   Greek
   goddess of snow
   ,
   was
   Caitlin Snow
   's alternate personality, until she obtained a body of her own. Since she was a child, Killer Frost existed within Caitlin due to cryogenic experiments performed on the latter by her father,
   Thomas Snow
   , in an effort to prevent Caitlin from suffering from ALS. However, Killer Frost was suppressed until Caitlin's time with
   <a href="Team Flash.html" key="20e14ee9-54f1-45df-8e0a-72495e2ed448" title="Team Flash">
    Team Flash
   </a>
   , when her alternate personality began to reemerge. Originally, Caitlin's Killer Frost powers mostly amplified her insecurities and anger, changing her chemical balance, but the further she continued to use these powers, the further she changed. Eventually, after defeating
   Savitar
   , Caitlin developed a special partnership with her Killer Frost side, going on to analyze her condition, which resulted in Killer Frost becoming a full-blown split personality, the actions of whom Caitlin would largely not remember.

  <p key="42ce3a90-9d65-44bd-9b90-f34fecfd84f6">
   In a battle against
   Clifford DeVoe
   , Killer Frost disappeared as a result of DeVoe using
   Dominic Lanse
   's powers to create a mental block, which prevented Caitlin from accessing her alter-ego.
   After defeating
   Siren-X
   from
   Earth-X
   though, Caitlin discovered that cryogenic anomalies still existed in her DNA, without the presence of
   dark matter
   .

   After the team found out that Caitlin's father is actually alive, they discovered that he is also a cryogenic meta-human with an evil split personality,
   Icicle
   . During a battle with him, Caitlin is able to break through the mental block created, allowing Killer Frost to emerge. Cisco later gave Caitlin a
   mental activity dampener
   created by
   Harry Wells
   so she could communicate with Killer Frost.
   During a fight with
   <a href="Orlin Dwyer.html" key="d5c07221-3781-4617-8ab8-75b4f0245ae1" title="Orlin Dwyer">
    Cicada

   , Team Flash discovered that Killer Frost was immune to his
   dagger
   (as she was not a dark matter-created meta) and could help defeat him.

  <p key="4ad59107-458b-4344-aa72-43b9ac57adf2">
   Soon after defeating
   Mirror Monarch
   , both Frost and Caitlin suffered from immense recurring headaches, which seemingly led to them becoming separated from one another and Frost inhabiting a body of her own.

   Frost chose life in prison without parole and decide to pay for her mistakes that she made.  The judge, the prosecutor and the jury were very lenient and offered no jail time and gave her an ultimatum to take the
   meta-human cure
   , but she declined and decided to take life in prison without parole and the judge gave her what she wants.

   Around 1999,
   Caitlin Snow
   's father,
   Thomas Snow
   , discovered that his daughter inherited his ALS gene. Desperate to save her, Thomas began performing experiments of cryogenic gene therapies on Caitlin in an attempt to freeze the disease, just as he had done with himself. While the experiments were successful, Caitlin began exhibiting a dual personality, whom Thomas called "Khione" after the Greek goddess of snow.
   During one such incident, Caitlin fell off her bicycle during an accident and got hurt as a speeding car approached, causing her second personality to fully emerge. Caitlin would repress this memory and Killer Frost for years.

In an effort to bring her back to life, Julian ripped off Caitlin's necklace and her powers caused her wound to heal, but once she opened her eyes, it was Killer Frost who emerged. She knocked everyone back with a huge wave of ice and emerged from the icy smoke with her hair fully white.
   She then attempted to kill them with beams of ice from her hands, even knocking Cisco and H.R. by smashing a window they were behind. Julian then attempted to grab her necklace and put it back on Caitlin's neck, only for Frost to destroy it with another ice shot. He told her that he cared for her, and she used this to her advantage, telling him to kiss her so she could freeze his head. However, before they could meet each other's lips, Cisco knocked her back over a table and into a wall with a vibe blast.

   When the three men ran out of the room, Frost followed and found them attempting to hide in the

   the building
   for her, she was already gone. Later, while Killer Frost was walking through the woods, she came across Savitar. At first, she was startled until he told her not to be afraid of him as he wanted her to become an ally of his. She asked him why she should trust him and he revealed himself to be Barry Allen's
   time remnant

   Tracy Brand
   at
   Central City University
   . When she arrived, Barry, Cisco and H.R. were already there trying to get her out. Frost entered by freezing and smashing a glass door and sending an icicle right for Tracy. However, before she could be impaled, Barry moved her out of the way with his super speed and told H.R. to get her out. He was then knocked to the ground by Frost's ice beam. As she was about to run after H.R. and Tracy, Cisco got in her way, she rubbed the fact that she was fully Killer Frost now in his face and shot him with an ice beam, knocking him over a counter and onto the floor. This was when Barry got up and used a flamethrower and his speed to launch fire at her, causing her to retreat. When she reported back to Savitar, he accused her of letting Barry and Cisco go on purpose and told her all she had to do to be a god like him is kill Tracy.

   She later showed up outside
   Jitters
   and was about to attack Tracy and H.R. again until Barry, Julian and Cisco showed up, allowing H.R. and Tracy to flee the scene. Frost chased after them by creating a path of ice that flew through the air with Barry chasing after her, attempting to get her to return to Jitters so Cisco could shoot her down. However, when she reached Jitters, Cisco couldn't shoot her down as he still saw her as his friend, and this gave her the opportunity to shoot a beam of ice at him, so Barry was forced to run in front of him and take the shot, sending him down a flight of stairs. Killer Frost then reached the ground again and walked over to Barry, taunting him. She then stabbed him in the leg again, stating "scar tissue is much more sensitive than regular tissue".

Barry then attempted to talk to get Caitlin to snap out of it and let Cecile go but to no avail, she then reveals that she knows Cisco is hiding up in the rafters and sets off a bomb forcing him to quickly open a breach and land across the warehouse, knocked out and in a pile of boxes.

At first, it seemed Frost was winning until Cisco mustered enough power to knock her back into a wall, knocking her out. Savitar then appeared and sped her out of the warehouse.

   Since Savitar was a time remnant of Barry, he remembered everything that Barry did, so Team Flash wiped Barry's mind to prevent Savitar from knowing their plan. After they did this, Killer Frost wanted their plan to speed up and approached Savitar's kneeling armor in order to get to work only for him to abruptly stand and hold Frost against a wall by her throat. She asks what he's doing but he only asks the questions "who are you?" and "who am I?". She then realizes what's wrong and travels to
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   to get help from Team Flash. When Cisco, Wally and Julian return to the Cortex, Frost was waiting for them. Wally attempted to speed towards her but realized that he had lost his speed and she tells them that she knows why. The three were discussing with each other to see if they should trust her or not until Barry, Iris and Joe walked in, wondering why they looked so worried when Killer Frost walked out from Caitlin's old lab, causing Joe to pull his gun on her. Everyone told him to stand down and he did so. Barry, still in his amnesia like state, asked if Frost was some kind of supervillain, causing her to look at him with an "obviously" look on her face. He then left the room, which left Frost with former allies of Caitlin. She explains that what Barry remembers, Savitar remembers, and the team could just teach Barry everything and beat Savitar. However, there were lots of villains in Central City and no Flash to stop them at all.

  <p key="4e3af50b-a726-40a7-a70f-314af96f2015">
   She then convinced them all that they needed to work with her to bring back Barry's memories. Cisco and Julian worked with Frost and while they worked, Cisco attempted to remind her of all of the memories they had working on the particle accelerator. It seemed to get through to Caitlin but Frost quickly took over again. Later, the three ran back to the cortex and turned on the TV, only to see that a building had been set ablaze by an infamous arsonist. Frost ends up helping Barry recover his memories and put out the flames. After everything had calmed down, she attempted to leave only to be stopped by Barry, Cisco and Julian. They tried to tell her that she was their friend and could be again with Julian also saying that he loves her, but she replied that she never loved any of them and entered the elevator. Once the elevator started its descent, Caitlin briefly took over only for Frost to bury her again.

   Killer Frost approached Savitar to ask what he was working on in his suit and he replied that his suit was damaged during his fight with Barry. Frost then asked if they were a team, referring to them both as "Barry and Caitlin". He looked up and replied that he wasn't Barry and she wasn't Caitlin. She then asked if Savitar was really going to kill Iris after all of the memories he shared with her. He asked if she is having second thoughts about their plan and she only shook her head, visibly scared. Memories begin to flood into Savitar's head and she asked what he saw. He explains that Barry went back in time to ask for
   Leonard Snart
   's help to retrieve the power source for their
   weapon
   to use against Savitar. Frost asked if she should stop them but Savitar just said that it doesn't matter. Later, Cisco got a vibe of Killer Frost in a forest, waiting for him to come fight her. Cisco then arrived at her location and the two began to fight only for Frost to overpower Cisco, flooring him and giving her a chance to kill him.

  <p key="9e5ef2c6-f0f9-4680-8e9a-76311e9fc0a9">
   However, before she could finish Cisco off, Savitar sped in and commanded her to spare his life. Confused, she asked why he needed to live. He explained that Iris had survived because H.R. had taken her place and died, and that they needed Cisco to build something for them. H.R. died because Killer Frost took H.R. back to Savitar to be murdered when H.R. was disguised as Iris West in an escape attempt. The three then speed back to Savitar's lair. Savitar explained to Cisco that he needed to convert the Speed Force bazooka into a quantum splicer in order for him to survive without the time paradox catching up on him. In order to make Cisco begin working, Savitar also threatened Frost's life, knowing that he would never get over the death of his best friend. After Savitar had left, Frost asked Cisco if he had finished the splicer and he nodded. He then attempted to tell her that if she continued to work with Savitar he would eventually kill her after he didn't need her abilities anymore, but she disagreed and thought they would always work together.

  <p key="6327c1be-f61b-48f5-9fd6-aa5efb5afe11">
   Right afterwards, Savitar returned to his lair. He asks if everything is done and Cisco explained that it is.

   They then turned to see that all of Team Flash had arrived. Frost told Savitar to go whilst she fought Cisco and Gypsy. She was quickly thrown to the ground which gave Cisco the chance to kill her but he refused and gave her a cure that was made by Caitlin's mother and Julian. She seemed very hesitant but once Savitar grabbed Cisco and was about to kill him, Caitlin Snow managed to take over Killer Frost and buried her instead and she saved Cisco's life.  Killer Frost and Caitlin never apologized to Cisco for her attempts to murder him. After Frost's defeat, Savitar was also erased from existence and Caitlin left soon after.

She also retrieves her new suit from a large black bag and leaves to go and find Amunet Black. When she reached Amunet's club, Frost threatens her bodyguards to get past them and is greeted by Amunet herself. The two women and Norvock then enter a back room where Amunet kept

Iris then attempted to talk Killer Frost out of leaving and told her that she and Caitlin could live together as one. However, Frost only threatened to freeze her hand off and leaves the room to go fight Amunet. The two women meet under a bridge. Frost didn't expect to see Amunet herself and was caught off guard when she launched a large piece of metal into Frost's shoulder.

Caitlin then returns to S.T.A.R. Labs and decided to stay while Iris, Felicity and Cecile fought Amunet. However, when things went south and Felicity and Iris were captured, Caitlin appeared in front of Amunet and her henchmen and allowed Killer Frost to take control. As Iris and Felicity ran behind Frost, Amunet ordered her goons to kill them but before any of the bullets could hit them, Frost made a giant igloo-like ice dome-shield to protect them. Iris then told Cecile to turn on a giant magnet so Amunet couldn't use her powers. She did as Frost had instructed, and rendered Amunet powerless. Frost then formed an icicle, ready to stab and kill Amunet until Iris managed to talk her out of it and they all return to the lab.  Despite all Iris did to help her, Killler Frost never apologized to Iris for Killer Frost working with Savitar to murder Iris. Killer Frost never apologized to Cecile for threatening to murder her.  Later, the boys from Barry's bachelor party arrived back in the lab to find Killer Frost waiting for them in the cortex. They are shocked to see her at first but she slowly transformed back into Caitlin and explained to them what was going on with her. After this, Caitlin and Killer Frost began working together and Frost became a fully fledged member of Team Flash.

   Later, Frost and Ralph finished their heart-to-heart as she explained how afraid she was that Caitlin would one day grow tired of her and take the cure herself.  Killer Frost didn't remember that she was not a dark matter meta, and the cure wouldn't work on her. Norvok then entered and announced that it was time for the meta-humans to leave, however, before the chopper could take off, Cicada appeared as Ralph attempted to get the metas to safety. Barry and Frost both stayed in order to fend Cicada off but Barry was ultimately unsuccessful, being launched into a large pile of crates, unconscious. Frost then fought Cicada head on, even being able to draw blood by cutting him with an icicle, however, he managed to generate a large blast, knocking her backwards, causing her to be disoriented. Just as his dagger was about to hit Frost in the back of the head, Caitlin psychically warned her, allowing her to swiftly dodge the weapon with ease and also freeze it long enough for Barry to gain back his powers. However, Cicada managed to escape into hiding with Team Flash believing he would stay hidden for a while longer. After Caitlin resurfaced, Frost gifted her with an apology and also a crucial piece needed to complete the meta-human cure, Cicada's blood.

However, she did not notice Cicada's dagger behind her and it ultimately stabbed her in the back, killing her. Desperate to help, Nora ran back in time and ran back to before Iris was kidnapped, when Frost and Caitlin were both alive. After resetting the timeline 52 times, failing to save each Team Flash member, Nora finally let them help her come up with a plan to make sure no one died. As Iris and Nora distracted him, Frost, Ralph and Cisco all appeared on the roof and shot at Cicada but before the dagger could hit one of them, Nora briefly reversed time and made it stab Cicada instead, forcing him to retreat.

Eventually, Frost managed to shoot him off his path but he also managed to ambush and stab her in the shoulder, forcing Killer Frost back and bringing Caitlin out. However, before he could kill her, Thomas overtook Icicle and was reunited with his daughter.

When The Flash and Frost arrived, she used her powers to launch Romero out a nearby window into the street below, receiving a lecture from Barry on their no-killing agreement. In order to work out her frustration, Frost trained with powers on a S.T.A.R. Labs test dummy before Barry entered the room to try and talk with her. In order to get her to talk about what was bothering her, he challenged her to try and hit him with her powers only for her to finally give up and proclaim that she was angry her new life would be erased by the crisis.

    After
     Caitlin Snow
     's father,
    Thomas Snow
    , discovered that she had the genetic marker for ALS, he used experimental cryogenic gene therapy on her to prevent the ALS from manifesting. The alterations Thomas had made to the treatment resulted in Caitlin developing a dual-personality (i.e. Killer Frost) and meta-human abilities soon after he treated her.
     Caitlin's Killer Frost persona, and the powers associated with her, remained dormant for 17 years (apart from a few brief episodes during her childhood), as several tests never showed signs of a meta-gene. Three years after the
     S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator
     explosion, Caitlin's powers finally emerged fully.

       Furthermore, her powers can reach such low levels that they can completely negate a speedster's healing powers and alternatively neutralize accelerated decomposing; by generating temperatures as low as -360 degrees, she proved able to shatter beings as powerful as the
