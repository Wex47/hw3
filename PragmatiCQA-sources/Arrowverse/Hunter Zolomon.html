   was a
   meta-human
   speedster from
   Earth-2
   . Years after witnessing his
   father
   murder his
   mother
   when he was a child, Hunter became a serial killer. Following the
   S.T.A.R. Labs
   particle accelerator
   explosion, Hunter was affected during electroshock therapy by the
   dark matter
   emitted, giving him superhuman speed and various other abilities derived from it. Following this, he escaped and began acting as the supervillain known as

   . Later, using
   Velocity serums
   , Hunter managed to artificially increase his speed to the point where he could break the dimensional barrier. Having gotten tired of being the villain, Hunter decided to become the "hero" as

   speedster
   he found on
   another Earth
   and kept as prisoner. He created the charade in order to instill false hope—hope that would be ripped away.

   Hunter Zolomon was born to
   James
   and
   Ashley Zolomon
   in
   Central City
   . When he was 11 years old, Hunter came downstairs to find his father abusing his mother, demanding respect following service in the
   War of the Americas
   . Noticing Hunter, Ashley pleaded for him to run but James took him in front of his mother, giving Hunter his
   silver helmet
   , and forced him to watch as he murdered Ashley. Shortly after, James was sent to prison, causing Hunter to be placed at an
   orphanage

   Dissatisfied with the speed he already had but too impatient/emotionally damaged to increase it naturally, Hunter sought to increase and developed one of the first versions of the Velocity serums to drastically increase his speedster might. Once gaining enough speed, he adopted a villainous identity as "Zoom". As one of his first acts of violence, he lured 15 members of the
   Central City Police Department
   on Earth-2 into a trap to demonstrate his power and how he couldn't be stopped. Zoom viciously murdered all but one officer so that the survivor could live and tell the tale. After that officer relayed the story, Zoom returned to the man's home that night to be killed as well. The story given by the last surviving officer resulted in Zoom gaining his moniker.

   Though successful in making himself faster, the Velocity drug had deadly side-effects and afflicted him with an illness that was killing him. Additionally, the Velocity drug turned Hunter's lightning blue. Desperate to save himself, Hunter set out to find a cure throughout the
   multiverse

   another speedster
   in attempt to absorb the man's speed. He defeated the speedster and tried to absorb the man's speed but couldn't. So he took the man prisoner and put a
   mask
   on that prevented from using his speed or talking.
   It was this time when he decided to disguise as a hero, to give the people false hope taking the speedster's name and alter ego "Jay Garrick" and cleaned himself up.

Labs when Dr. Wells presented several new gadgets designed to detect meta-humans, and accused Dr. Wells directly of these crimes in front of the public. However, Dr. Wells claimed not to know of Flash's accusations, and Flash was disgusted with Wells not taking responsibility for these mistakes, begging to make things right and "help" him "stop Zoom". However Dr. Wells, coldly told him everyone in Central City would be safe if he would stop Zoom and The Flash sped off in seeming disgust.

Knowing that Barry's Speed Force held the answer to curing himself, Hunter plotted to steal it. To expedite Barry's accumulation of Speed, he, as Zoom, began sending meta-human villains from
   Earth-2

   Following Atom-Smasher's defeat, Hunter arrived at S.T.A.R. Labs, bypassed their newly installed security, introduced himself, and claimed that their world was in danger.
   Hunter introduced himself as "Jay Garrick" and explained to the skeptical team that the singularity had, in fact, opened a portal to his Earth through which other meta-humans had traveled, and that in his world he was a speedster named The Flash. Hunter also told them of his "enemy" Zoom and the circumstances of his arrival, but a skeptical Barry asked Jay to be tested to see if he really was a speedster. Hunter did so willingly, and explained his story of being a scientist to Caitlin, but Barry was still skeptical and had Hunter put in the pipeline prison. Hunter agreed to this, but tried to convince Barry that if Zoom had already sent Atom-Smasher, he would send others. Hunter also subjected himself to a full body scan upon Caitlin's request, and was tested on Barry's treadmill. However, Zoom also brought Sand Demon over with the same offer he made Atom-Smasher, to kill the Flash and he'd return him home and Sand Demon agreed. Once Sand Demon attacked Barry, Hunter offered his help to the team. However, Barry declined, believing they didn't need his help, and Hunter was locked back up in the pipeline.

After Harrison called "Jay" a coward the two got into a heated fight which was only broken up by Barry. Hunter was present when Harrison announced his plan to find Dr. Light was to give Light's helmet to Cisco, revealing he was secretly a meta-human. After some effort Cisco used his powers of astral projection to find Dr. Light at the train station. At the station Flash asked Hunter for advice but he was unsure of how to beat Light until Dr. Wells told him how to create speed mirages, but he initially was unsuccessful. Hunter however insisted Barry could do it, stating he was a better speedster and hero than he ever was, and with this inspiration Barry was able to beat Light.

Caitlin told him they could devise some way to get his speed back, but he said that when he arrived on Earth-1. The first thing he tried was exactly that, and whatever tests she had in mind, he had already done.

While there, Hunter told her he had had the same thought, and was just as confused when he couldn't find any "Jay Garrick" of Earth-1, but eventually he found him; pointing him out, he said his name was
   Hunter Zolomon
   , and claiming that this Hunter was an orphaned "Jay Garrick" adopted by the Zolomons. When Caitlin asked him why Hunter One couldn't help out, Hunter Two told her that his DNA had been mutated when he obtained his powers, and that the final conclusion was that the only thing that could reverse his sickness was defeating Zoom and having his speed restored.
   In reality Hunter showed Caitlin his Earth-1 doppelganger in an attempt to get her to stop trying to help him, and to give her an explanation of his own on why his doppelganger wasn't named "Jay Garrick", thus preventing Caitlin from realizing that the man she knows is not actually "Jay Garrick". This slip-up later allowed
   Team Flash
   , with the help of Harry's Earth-2 knowledge, to find the clues to Zoom's true identity as Hunter Zolomon, a serial killer from Earth-2.

   When Barry, Cisco, and Wells traveled to Earth-2, Caitlin, and Joe remained to protect the city. After a meta human named Geomancer began attacking the city in an effort to draw out the Scarlet Speedster, Joe and Caitlin believe it's time for Hunter to take Velocity 6 again. Hunter, fearing the drug for what it's done to him, initially refuses but after telling Caitlin about Zoom not really taking his speed but rather the drug being the culprit, he is encouraged by Caitlin's loving support and together they formulated Velocity 7, which gave Hunter his speed back temporarily to confront Geomancer but his speed disappeared in the middle of their fight, resulting in Hunter at Geomancer's mercy. However, Joe shot at Geomancer, injuring him and forcing him to flee. Later, while Caitlin tends to his wounds, they discuss the short-lived success of Velocity 7 and plan to work immediately on Velocity 8.

   Noticing the presence of the Flash,
   Reverb
   decided to contact Zoom and inform him that a new speedster had appeared on Earth-2. Zoom already knew it was Barry and, following the plan made with his time remnant, decided to take advantage and in secret set up an ambush for the speedster using Killer Frost, Deathstorm and Reverb as an enticement/bait for the Flash. When Zoom finally arrived to enact the ambush, he was enraged to find Reverb and Deathstorm pummeling an unconscious Flash repeatedly against his direct orders that any speedsters found were not to be harmed. As punishment, Zoom brutally murdered both Reverb and Deathstorm but spared Killer Frost's life because she in fact had obeyed his commands. Zoom then scooped up the unconscious Flash, raced back to his lair and sealed Flash in a glass prison nearby Jesse. When Barry finally regained consciousness, Zoom returned to his lair just as Barry promised Jesse that he would get her out. Confronting the captive speedster, Zoom sadistically reminded him not to make promises he couldn't keep.

   Hunter later learned that the Velocity 7 caused more cellular degeneration, though Hunter told Caitlin he had faith the next batch won't do harm. Later, Iris asked him if she could write an article on him. Hunter was reluctant at first but eventually agreed. Soon after, Geomancer caused tremors and collapsed a hospital. Hunter took the next Velocity serum and rescued the people at the hospital. When he returned, Iris told him she had everything she needed for her article. Hunter then took a "nap", but presumably actually traveled to Earth-2, realizing that he couldn't maintain his identities on two Earths at the same time. Hunter then created a
   time remnant
   and convinced it to be killed as part of his plan to push Barry to get faster. The time remnant was then sent to Earth-1, to explain Hunter's disappearance with the "nap" and assist Caitlin with closing the breach.

   Zoom then confronted his prisoners, telling the man in the iron mask to stop making contact with Jesse and the Flash. Zoom then phased through Barry's cell and beat him down, before leaving. When Wells, Cisco, Killer Frost and Earth-2 Barry and Iris rescue the prisoners, Zoom arrived and thanked Killer Frost for leading them to him. Zoom then went to kill Jesse before being betrayed by Killer Frost, who took her revenge on him for killing Ronnie.

   Zoom escaped Killer Frost's attack and made it to S.T.A.R. Labs before Barry could bring Wells over. Zoom was temporarily stunned by Wells but made it through the breach in time to kill his time remnant.
   When Hunter arrived back to Earth-2, he dumped his time remnant to the ground, claiming the situation to be a complication.
   Additionally, now being closed off from Earth-1, Zoom imprisoned Killer Frost rather than kill her due to looking exactly like Caitlin, who Hunter had genuinely fallen in love with during his masquerade as "Jay Garrick" on Earth-1.

   Team Flash would mourn "Jay's" death, until Cisco started vibing Zoom every time he was near his helmet. After revealing this to the team, Cisco was asked to vibe the helmet once again, upon which he realized, to his horror and horror of the team, that "Jay" and Zoom were the same person.
   Determined to make Zoom pay for his deception, Barry began to discover new ways to get faster to defeat the evil speedster while Cisco continued to receive "day-mares" of Zoom while near his helmet. After receiving the formula for tachyons from

   For six weeks, Hunter waited for Cisco to open a breach. One day, Hunter felt a breach being opened. He raced to where this was occurring and watched as a breach was being opened, but was disappointed when Cisco abruptly stopped. When Cisco opened a breach once again, Zoom made his way over. Zoom told Flash they made a mistake and the two raced over to S.T.A.R. Labs. Hunter then noted that Flash had gotten much faster, which would give him more speed to steal. Barry and Zoom quickly fought but Zoom hesitated as Flash set up cutouts of his parents. With Zoom briefly distracted, Zoom was shot by Flash with the
   B.O.O.T.
   Subdued and unmasked, Hunter asked how Barry knew of his past. Barry then told him he made a mistake by revealing to Caitlin who his doppelgänger was. When Hunter asked how he knew he was Zoom, Barry revealed that he was aware that Velocity serums turn a speedster's lightning blue if they run fast enough. Hunter noted Barry was clever to use his family against him and that family is a weakness. Hunter then told Barry that he couldn't lock the darkness up before breaking out and speeding off.

   Following Barry's move, Zoom kidnapped
   Wally West
   and brought him to his lair on Earth-2. Zoom was then contacted by Vibe, who told him Barry would give up his speed in exchange for Wally. Zoom made his way back to Earth-1 with Wally. Once he passed Wally over, Hunter had Harry Wells make preparations to transfer Barry's speed to him, upon which Harry promised to knock his smug face off one day. Hunter then explained that the "Jay" he killed was his
   time remnant
   rather than a speed mirage, explaining that he realized he needed to be on both Earths once Barry closed all the breaches and went to Earth-2. Hunter also told them that he grew tired of playing the villain after a while and later enjoyed pretending to be a hero so he could rip hope away from everyone, though Hunter was called a monster by Caitlin, the very words his father was called. Once Barry ran on the treadmill and his speed absorbed, Hunter injected the vial with Barry's speed and cured himself. A victorious Hunter then thanked Barry as he held him against a wall, ready to give him death in return. However, just as Hunter was about to deal the killing blow, Caitlin told Hunter if there was a piece of humanity left in him, and if he really loved her, he wouldn't kill Barry. Hunter then dropped Barry before kidnapping Caitlin.

   A few moments later, Zoom returned to S.T.A.R Labs to find a time-traveled version of Barry from 2018 and
   another girl
   . After 2018 Barry reminded him that he already got what he came for, Hunter asked for the girl's identity. Suddenly, he realized that the girl was another speedster. Seeing this as an opportunity to take the girl's speed as well, Zoom chased after the two as they tried to run into a portal to go to another time. He entered the portal after them and continued to pursue them, only for a Time Wraith to grab him first instead of Barry and the girl. It is unknown what happened to Zoom after this, although it can be inferred that the Time Wraith returned Zoom to his proper place in time and erased his memories of future Barry and Nora to ensure the continuity of the timeline.

  <p key="f0d42553-bec0-4edc-ac7e-b61fdcc2b4f7">
   Zoom later returned to Earth-2. Through vibing, Cisco was able to determine that Zoom had taken Caitlin back to his mountain-top lair and tried to sway her into siding with him to no avail. Undaunted, Hunter allowed her to roam freely in the lair, knowing that she couldn't escape, while he attended to other business.

   When Zoom finally returned, he found Caitlin under attack from her Earth-2 counterpart Killer Frost after being tricked into breaking her out. Wasting no time, Zoom ran through Caitlin (using his speed to become temporarily intangible), grabbed the icicle Frost had fired at Caitlin out of the air, and ruthlessly stabbed Frost in the stomach with it, killing her instantly while sadistically remarking that he did not need her anymore. Turning to Caitlin, he warned her that if she tried to escape again, he would kill the
   man in the iron mask
   . Zoom subsequently chained Caitlin to a bed and tried again to reason with her but she would not listen, only pleading with Hunter that he return her to Earth-1. Hunter then explained to Caitlin that he used to measure his success by how many people he killed, but would begin to measure his success by how many Earths he conquered instead. Preparing to invade Earth-1, Hunter sadistically laughed at a horrified Caitlin and took her to Earth-1, fulfilling her wish albeit in a very twisted manner.

When the cops were about to retaliate, he reminded them that their guns were useless against him. Caitlin managed to convince Zoom not to kill them and he agreed, warning that if they tried anything, they would all meet their end. Afterwards, he chained Caitlin to a desk within the police department. When she questioned if his plan was to kill everyone, Hunter said not everyone as he wants to spare Caitlin due to his love for her. When she asks why he needs her, he gets a flashback of his mother's death and everything that followed and states he needs her because he doesn't want to be alone ever again.

   As part of his plan for invasion, Zoom brought Rupture over. Later, he met up with Rupture to see if he killed Cisco, as Zoom managed to convince Dante's doppelgänger that Vibe had killed his brother Reverb. Rupture failed but when he said would find him and get justice, Zoom told him to wait for now as he needed him to set an example and ordered him to go to Jitters and kill the police. After he left, Hunter sensed Caitlin's disapproval with his plan and she then asked if he wore the mask to scare people. This prompted another flashback of his rehabilitation back on his Earth and his desperation to convince his doctors that he wasn't a monster. However, it appears he moved past that as he coldly reminded Caitlin in his demonic voice that she said he was "nothing but a monster" before speeding off. Caitlin managed to get a phone and warn Team Flash of what is to come at Jitters. Utilizing that information, they set up trap for Rupture, using the Flash hologram to distract him and then depowering him with the Boot. The victory was short lived as Hunter saw the news report of Rupture's failure and quickly deduced that Caitlin had betrayed him by telling Team Flash his plan. She reminded him that he didn't keep his promise of sparing lives, and Zoom declared darkly that they were even then and sped off to Jitters.

   Once arriving there, he demonstrated his immense speed by snapping the neck of the camera man and every cop in the vicinity in mere seconds, only sparing Joe and Captain Singh due to his affection for Caitlin. When Barry came in as Zoom throttled Singh for going against their agreement of not trying anything against him, Barry told him he proved enough. Zoom wasn't done however and after tossing Singh aside, he fatally stabbed Rupture with his claws and declared him just as worthless as his brother. Taking a camera, he told everyone watching that there was no Flash, just a hologram and that nothing can save them now from him taking over the city. Having made his point, he sped off. When Barry was trying to get his speed back by recreating the particle accelerator explosion, Hunter watched a bolt of lightning strike S.T.A.R. Labs and grew angry at the possibility his enemy would return. He quickly ran off to try to stop the return of The Flash. However, when he arrived, it appeared that Barry had died. Zoom mocked Team Flash for trying to bring back their beloved hero, instead killing him. Satisfied, Zoom sped off.

   While Team Flash was busy with bringing Barry Allen, trapped in the Speed Force, back to life, Zoom was gathering the Earth-2 meta-humans on Earth-1. Tired with Caitlin's anger at him, he's given her a choice: stay with him and be safe, or go back to Team Flash, only to be treated with the same "mercy" as its other members should they meet Zoom again. After delivering his ultimatum, Hunter left Caitlin alone in her room. She stayed back and listened as Zoom delivered a speech before his meta-human "brothers and sisters", urging them to take Earth-1 from normal humans.

   Once the city was in the "
   Metapocalypse

After Barry's arrival, Hunter taunted Barry over his naiveté when it came to protecting people, and insisted that he and Barry were really the same person, noting their similar dark backgrounds. Barry angrily disagreed with Hunter's comparison, but just then, a building started collapsing across the street and Barry went to save all the people in the building, proving Hunter's point. Later, Hunter was visited by Laurel Lance, who mentioned she saw and fought The Flash. Hunter urged her to knock down more building, as that is her strength, in order to distract The Flash and his team. After Team Flash turned on their Pulse weapon, Zoom, along with all his minions, felt its harmful effects. However, Zoom was able to quickly make a portal in order to escape to Earth-2.

   Shortly after, Zoom returned to Earth-1 and crashed the West household where he kidnapped Henry Allen, prompting Barry to pursue him across Central City before Zoom took Henry to Barry's childhood home. Hunter, claiming that it was "poetic justice" to have Henry killed in the same place as Nora once was, taunted Barry as the latter repeatedly begged for Hunter to let Henry go. However, insisting that Henry's death would push Barry to be just like him, Hunter phased through Henry's chest, stopping Henry's heart and killing him as Barry watched on in devastation.

   The two then engaged in a high-speed chase-fight throughout Central City, during which Zoom took a quick detour to surreptitiously create another time remnant which continued the chase while the real Zoom disappeared. The violent chase finally culminated in Barry bringing down the time remnant Hunter in an alley-way, before ruthlessly attacking him and pinning him before preparing to finish Zoom off. Hunter once more dared Barry to give into his rage and commit murder, constantly baiting him, but Barry could not bring himself to do so. Suddenly, the real Hunter appeared out of nowhere and killed the time remnant in front of the shocked Flash. Informing Barry that he'd also be able to create a time remnant provided that he possessed the willpower to kill his other self, Zoom declared that Barry was "almost ready" before swatting him aside and racing away, as a tearful Barry watched on in defeat.

   Mercury Labs
   '
   Magnetar
   , a device capable of destroying all other universes in the
   Multiverse

  <p key="116d378e-ccf1-409d-8900-4ccdae6a7f97">
   As Hunter worked on the Magnetar, he was approached by Caitlin who, in an attempt to bait Zoom unbeknownst to him, falsely insisted that she began to see reason and loved Hunter once more before apologizing for her earlier words and actions.

To his shock however, "Caitlin" disappeared when he delivered the killing blow, revealing a hologram as the real Caitlin was safe in the S.T.A.R. Labs van with Team Flash.

   breaches

   another Earth
   where he met that Earth's Flash, who he was easily able to subdue. Following, Hunter captured and imprisoned him on Earth-2 but wasn't able to steal the man's speed. Instead, Hunter kept him not only as a trophy, but also to assume his identity to give false hope to the people of Earth-2. With this, Hunter revealed the man's name: the true
   Jay Garrick

   Zoom returned to Earth-1 with Joe and waited beside the Magnetar as Barry and Team Flash met him there. As Barry revealed that they figured out Hunter's true endgame, Hunter simply confirmed it and laid out his one condition: if Barry backed out for any reason during the race, Hunter would kill Joe and Team Flash. Barry accepted and shortly afterward began his race with Zoom, with the two speedsters speeding around the Magnetar. In the midst of the race however, in his arrogance, Zoom failed to notice Barry traveling mere moments through time, creating a
   time remnant
   . While the remnant continued the race, the original Barry jumped off the Magnetar and freed Joe. Eventually noticing Barry's tactic, Zoom furiously leaped off the Magnetar and tackled him before boasting that Barry would be unable to stop the Magnetar regardless as it was too late. However, Hunter then watched as Barry's remnant began to create a phase of his own to counteract the Magnetar, killing himself in the process while destroying the device and ruining Hunter's plan. As Zoom yelled in fury, he attempted to attack Barry's prime self but Barry quickly gained the upper hand, viciously beating the demonic speedster and throwing him to the ground, shattering Hunter's mask.

Barry coldly stated that he didn't have to and looked over his shoulder to see a pair of Time Wraiths emerge from the Speed Force. Badly beaten and weakened from the race, Hunter could only scream in terror as the Time Wraiths surrounded him and began forcibly transforming him into a demonic-looking skeletal being, changing the lightning-bolt emblem of his costume red as well as it's outline and the earpieces, turning the emblem circle white and turning his speed lightning red. The Time Wraiths then reopened their portal and dragged the decaying form of Zoom into the Speed Force.

As the Black Flash began to close in on Eobard's location Malcolm and Damien distracted him with arrows and swords as Eobard speed-punched him into a bank safe, which Malcolm sealed shut. Knowing the Black Flash wouldn't remain imprisoned for long, Thawne and his associates fled.

   Eventually, the Black Flash escaped from the bank vault and continued his hunt for the Reverse-Flash but was unexpectedly recalled back to the Speed Force by his masters. Endeavoring to save Wally West, Barry Allen had entered the Speed Force to rescue him. The Speed Force refused to let him do so and unleashed the Black Flash against him. The demonic speedster viciously battled the Flash throughout the Speed Force vision of S.T.A.R. Labs during which Barry immediately noticed Zolomon and attempted to escape in an elevator. The Black Flash grabbed Barry before he could and hurled him back out, pinning him to the ground. The Speed Force representative told Barry of what he had to do to save Wally and gave him a final ultimatum, whereupon the Black Flash began draining Barry's life-force. Understanding, Barry severed his tether to the real world by removing his chest emblem and slamming it onto the Black Flash's chest, banishing him temporarily in a blast of white light.

Eobard, blinded by his arrogance, had abandoned his early-warning system in the alternate reality and therefore did not realize the Black Flash was close until it was too late. Looking on in horror as the black-clad spectral speedster appeared on the horizon, the Reverse-Flash attempted to flee but the Black Flash caught up to him in a split second, seized him by the throat, and viciously phased his hand through Eobard's chest, obliterating his heart and erasing him and his time remnants from existence. Stopping briefly before Sara Lance, the Black Flash roared in her face before racing away, having fulfilled the will of the Speed Force.

As the Black Flash burst out of the Speed Force, he was immediately beset by Killer Frost, though he dodged her attacks easily. The Black Flash sped towards the two roaring like a wild animal and lunged for Savitar, only for Killer Frost to hit him with another cold blast, freezing and shattering the demonic speedster.

   Zoom's actions in killing Henry resulted in Barry creating the Flashpoint timeline to not live with the pain of losing both his parents.
   Barry would return the timeline to how it was after seeing what his decision did to his loved ones.
   But, it caused major changes to some members of the teams' lives.
   The creation of Flashpoint also resulted in

   Zoom would be remembered greatly by those he had the most impact on. When Wally received speedster powers because of Barry's timeline changes, Barry drew inspirations from past mentors to train Wally, including Zolomon.
   Harry would learn from his battles with Zoom and how he was willing to kill him to save Jesse. When Barry was thinking of killing
   Grodd
   , Harry talked him out of it, drawing inspiration from his mistakes involving Zoom.
   Having always been one step behind Zoom, Thawne, and Savitar, Barry was determined to get ahead of

   Caitlin would still at times refer to Zoom as Jay instead of Hunter.
   After Caitlin was manipulated by her
   father

     As Zoom, the individual he truly was, Hunter was obsessed with speed to the point of being unstable. As noted by
     Harry Wells
     , he's set a mission of eradicating anything else with super speed, enthralling or intimidating meta-humans. Hunter instills tremendous terror as Zoom in everyone he encounters, such as both versions of Linda Park and Al Rothstein. He was utterly ruthless, having little to no regard for human life, murdering anyone, such as the police officer he spared after murdering a S.W.A.T. team he baited, and Reverb after the latter disobeyed his rule about speedsters. He even went so far as to kill Rupture after the latter failed his mission and got captured despite obeying his orders. He was also willing to do anything to achieve his goals, as he killed many people to find a cure and his own
     time remnant
     agreed to die to ensure their goals when Team Flash was planning to close the breach.

     Hunter had been shown to be very egotistical, as after his victory against the Flash where he proceeded to parade Flash's body to Central City News, where he displayed it to the media like a hunting trophy, proclaiming himself to be "The fastest man alive". He then hauled the unconscious Flash to the Central City Police Department, gloating to the assembled officers, relishing in their helplessness as he caught dozens of bullets with his speed. Finally, he carried Barry's body back to S.T.A.R. Labs, showcasing him to
     Team Flash
     and also mocking Harry for believing that the Flash was going to defeat him. After kidnapping
     Wally West
     in exchange for Barry's speed and letting go, he was smug and confident, even after Harry threatened him he showed no concern or worry for his safety, instead he just smirked at Harry smugly. His arrogance and smugness has proven to be his one point of vulnerability when, in, the midst of gloating about his victory to Team Flash, he let his guard down long enough that he was shot by a speed-dampening dart by
     Cisco Ramon

     Hunter was also horribly sadistic, enjoying the fear and terror in his helpless prey with obvious and somewhat animalistic satisfaction. His sense of humor is extremely vile. Hunter is also a classic sociopath, as he displayed little to no remorse or regret in his use of other people, meta-humans or otherwise, treating them as disposable pawns to further his goals.

     Some question if he was still human, and Harry says he might be. This is indeed proven true when he attempted to kill Barry, however spares Barry for the plea of Caitlin, proving Hunter is capable of love. After abducting Caitlin, he was somewhat trusting of Caitlin, letting roam around his lair in his absence. He was also expressed a desire for the two of them to live together, much to Caitlin's chagrin. Hunter's shown to be protective of Caitlin, brutally murdering her doppelgänger after she tried killing her. However, he warned her not to try freeing his masked prisoner or he'd kill him. While he was angered that Caitlin managed to send a message to the team about Zoom using Rupture to ambush and kill the officers at Jitters, he did not harm her and instead went to kill the officers himself. However, Hunter showed to be impatient in his relationship with Caitlin, genuinely refusing to understand why wouldn't she love him anymore after he was revealed as Zoom. Tired of arguing with Caitlin, Hunter gives her an ultimatum; stay with him and be protected, or go back to her friends, only to be treated with no mercy should they ever meet again. However, when Caitlin ultimately chose her friends over him, Hunter's good side was completely erased.

     He appeared to suffer from some degree of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, as witnessed during his fight with the Flash who used cardboard cutouts of his parents, which triggered invasive memories of his childhood trauma. These invasive memories are characteristic of someone suffering from PTSD. He constantly had flashes to his traumatic experiences, either his father killing his mother, the orphanage he was placed in, or his shock therapy treatments, having lost time and reality of the present, leaving him off guard. Caitlin unknowingly caused him to experience these flashes more frequently, as her words would constantly remind him of these events. During this time Hunter tends to be more wild, impulsive, and far less tactical than he usually was, and acts in a deranged manner more akin to that of a feral animal. Hunter had demonstrated that he was perfectly willing to kill his time remnants in order to fulfill his goals.

    <p key="768cbcac-6159-4ebc-afbc-395232eb00c0">
     Hunter's sociopathic mind proved to be so severe that he would do the most insane and drastic measures to prove a point. One example is his laboring under the idea that he and Barry's similar backgrounds and histories make them, for but for a difference in their mothers' murders, the same person. Due to the fact that Barry never witnessed his mother's actual death when he was a child, he was not completely consumed by the darkness like Hunter was, and Hunter is determined to prove that they are essentially the same being in their essence. He attempts to do this by forcing Barry to confront his inner darkness on multiple occasions, one of the most notable being the battle against

      Laurel Lance
     </a>
     was one of Hunter's more poetic and disturbing ways of bringing Barry closer to the madness and darkness that had all but consuming. When this failed to work, Hunter then forced Barry to watch as he killed
     Henry Allen
     in the same room in which
     <a href="Eobard Thawne.html" key="8b5dbe91-6241-4cc6-a6a7-8ce7f3535280" title="Eobard Thawne">
      Eobard Thawne
     </a>
     had murdered
     Nora Allen
     16 years prior. This also displayed Hunter's taste for dark humor and irony when sadistically pushing his enemies over the edge, psychologically speaking. This was Hunter's final point to prove to Barry, and based on the latter's rage, grief, and desire to kill him equaling that of his desire to kill Eobard at the time of his capture a year earlier, it appeared that he succeeded when Barry could go through with it, but is left for the Wraiths instead, thus underestimating Barry's heroic nature. Hunter's psychological problems do not in any way exceed his intelligence, able to quickly familiarize and experiment with the complex speed force, design costumes to withstand the physical conditions speedsters must endure, and manipulate Barry constantly to his own ends.
    </p>
    Despite originally being classified as a psychopath, Hunter had moments where he fit more the description of a sociopath. This is based on his ability to form emotional attachments to those around him, perverse and twisted though they may be. It wasn't until Caitlin completely rejected him for the monster that he was that he gave up on any remaining attachments to others, thus embracing the true nature of a sociopath hellbent on committing homicide by destroying the
    multiverse
    . Overall, Hunter is a sociopath, he is not a psychopath because he has shown the ability to feel love and compassion, however, like most sociopaths, the ability for him to feel love and compassion is very limited.

     Genius-level intellect/Master tactician/Leader:

    Hunter is an extremely intelligent man and an incredible tactician and leader, as he was able to gather an army of meta-humans to aid in his control over
    Central City
    and successfully lead it while also fighting them and himself as the Flash, doing it so perfectly that none of the residents of
    Earth-2
    , even his meta-human followers, could deduce the connection between them. Despite his psychopathy, Hunter proved to be a methodical man, as he carefully studied
    Earth-1
    and finding out everything he could before confronting
    Team Flash
    , allowing him to convince them his intentions were good.
    also came up with a plan to make Barry faster by both personally guiding him and also sending villains under his command, doing so without attracting any suspicion from Team Flash and despite Team Flash eventually figuring out his identity and true motives, Hunter was successful in extracting Barry's speed by leveraging Wally's life. He also led his army to attack Earth-1 with great efficiency, overwhelming the efforts of Team Flash to contain them and would have conquered Earth-1 had it not been for Harry developing a sound amplifier capable of incapacitating every meta under his command. As the Black Flash, Hunter is now little more than an animal that the Speed Force sics on Speedsters messing with time.

However, Hunter's abilities as a scientist were still inferior to the likes of
      Harrison Wells
      , as he could not find a way to steal the Speed Force from
      Jay Garrick
      and needed Harry's help to steal Barry's speed.
      As the Black Flash, Hunter has lost all his scientific genius as he is reduced to being a mere animal that the Speed Force sics on Speedsters messing with time.

      Like most psychopaths, Hunter shows no concern, if not actual awareness, of right and wrong. To which, in showing no guilt, he is an accomplished actor. Hunter's persona as "Jay Garrick" and as "Zoom" were so different from one another that he was able to convince the citizens of
      Earth-2
      , his own meta-human followers, and Team Flash that were two different people for two years.
      During Caitlin's physiological exam during which she does a subtle lie detection exam, Hunter quickly became aware of this and showed none of the physical signs of deceit; showing his skills as a liar.
      While infiltrating Team Flash, he kept trying to make Barry become faster so he could eventually steal his speed without attracting any suspicions from them. Hunter was also successful into manipulating Barry into strongly wishing to defeat him by killing
      Henry Allen
      in front of Barry so he could make the latter race him in the Magnetar to create the pulsar needed to destroy the multiverse. As the Black Flash, Hunter is no longer capable of being deceitful.

    After his metamorphosis from the Time Wraiths, Hunter's senses appear to be much weaker, only able to perceive targets in motion. To which, if a speedster is not currently channeling the Speed Force (i.e. remains completely still) Hunter can't sense or even see him properly. Furthermore, while he can still see things (evident by the fact he never runs into anything), he apparently cannot differentiate between creatures that do not have Speed Force in them and inanimate objects, meaning he is completely oblivious to any danger that isn't an active speedster.

     Psychological trauma:
    </b>
    Hunter suffers from severe PTSD, due to him watching his father kill his mother. Barry utilized his past memories to induce extreme psychological trauma, in order for him to lose his focus and become more feral, thus allowing Barry to overpower him, trap him and finally unmask him. He constantly has flashes to his traumatic experiences, either his father killing his mother, the orphanage he was placed in, or his shock therapy treatments. Caitlin unknowingly caused him to experience these flashes more frequently, as her words would constantly remind him of these events. After being enslaved by the Speed Force for all time, Hunter's sanity, and any sense of identity was completely erased, reducing him to a feral beast unable to act beyond the will of the Speed Force, though with the small benefit of no longer being vulnerable to traumatic memories.

Hunter was terrified of the Time Wraiths and he was very careful in avoiding them as much as possible. When the Time Wraiths were intentionally summoned by Barry with the creation of a time remnant of his own, the Wraiths chose to go after and punish Zoom instead of Barry for the violation of the rules of the Speed Force (possibly since the remnant was used and sacrificed to save the multiverse). As they attacked Zoom, he screamed helplessly as the Time Wraiths aged him into a corpse-like figure, rendering him an eternal slave to the Speed Force. This also caused his lightning to change from blue to red while parts of his suit, particularly the emblems, also changed color from black to red.

Even more, a lasting side effect caused him cellular degeneration would in due course kill him . However, his remaining traces of natural Speed Force energy significantly slowed down the damage to his body.

This causes it to resemble the equipment he wore during the electroshock therapy sessions in the asylum. The suit's gloves are adorned with sharp "claws", allowing Hunter to perform slashing and pirecing attacks upon his enemies. The left side of the mask was ripped off by Barry after Barry defeated Zoom. While the Time Wraiths were taking Zoom away, red speed force lightning changed the colors of the emblems in the suit; the lightning emblems on the ears changed from black to red, the outlines and lightning symbol on the chest also transformed from black to red except the inner part of the logo was filled in with white.

This was revealed to be false, when "Jay" reveals that he "lost his speed" due to "overusing Velocity 6". He could channel the electricity on him to his claws to shock and cause pain to people he touched with them, as he did to Harry. At super speed or by vibrating, the claws can have enough force and momentum to kill someone that they are stabbed into, as he did to Reverb when vibrating his hand and he did to Rupture when charging at super speed. They became actual claws after the Time Wraiths transformed Hunter into the Black Flash.
