   France
   in the year 1916 and acquire the blood of
   Christ
   , then they will deliver it to the cathedral in Amiens, where their past selves can acquire it in order to use it to destroy the
   Spear of Destiny
   . As the team guessed, Rip doesn't like the plan, as it is a direct violation against the main rule of
   time travel
   : never go back to the times and places they have previously visited, as meeting with themselves can "break" time but even he can't come up with a better plan.

Sara and Jax try to confuse the past Legends, but when past Sara contacts the past Legends, they are convinced that the Sara they are seeing is fake, and a fight ensues. Sara is knocked out, but Ray realizes that she is real, which blows the whole situation.

As the Waverider lifts off, they are struck by a time storm, a phenomenon caused by the interaction between the past and future Legends, which causes the ship to crash. Eventually, both versions of the Legends decide to make a stand, and the future Legends claim they will sacrifice themselves, as this mission was always something they wouldn't survive from.

   time remnants

Sara finally makes peace with Laurel's death as she realizes Laurel is also okay with it and tells her that she loves her. Sara returns to reality and Thawne snatches the Spear. He attempts to use it again, but the Spear doesn't work. Sara reveals she made one change to reality, and Thawne realizes that Sara depowered the spear. Despite that, Thawne intends to kill the Legends, but Sara smugly tells him she needs to outrun "him" first.
   Black Flash
   appears from the

   and finally catches with Thawne, and rips his heart out. He then speeds to Sara with a warning, then disappears. Thawne starts to disappear and screams. With him gone, the time remnants also disappear. With reality restored, the remaining future Legends disappear as well, and future Sara reminds her past self that Legends never die.

   The Legends return Snart, Merlyn, and Darhk back to their original places in time. Mick returns Snart to
   Central City
   in 2014, just before Thawne recruited him. Snart claims that he will never become the man Mick describes, but Mick says that he won't die for himself, but for his friends. Mick then erases Snart's memories. Sara returns Darhk to Miami in 1987 and Darhk claims that she hasn't won, as she didn't save Laurel, and that he will kill her eventually, but Sara says she is okay with it as is Laurel. She then erases his memories as well. Amaya is packing her things, as she was planning to return to 1942. Nate, however, doesn't want her to go, and she decides to stick around, and she and Nate kiss. Later, Rip attempts to leave the ship, when Sara catches him. Rip claims that he's going to leave, as Sara has proven to be a lot better captain than he ever was, and he has nothing else to teach to the team. Sara gives him permission to leave the ship, and he leaves in the jumpship.

   As the Legends leave, Sara gives Mick the honor of choosing the destination. He orders Gideon to set a course for
   Aruba
   . However, when Gideon sets the course, a time quake hits the ship and the ship is knocked out from the time stream, once again making a crash landing. Gideon says that they have landed in
   Los Angeles
   in 2017, but as they gaze outside the ship, Sara says they broke time as they notice dinosaurs roaming in the streets and buildings from several different time periods.
