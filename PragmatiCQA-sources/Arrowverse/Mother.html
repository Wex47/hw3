    In this episode, which takes place in 2020,
    Harrison Wells
    helps reactivate the Speed Force. This parallels the
    original timeline
    , in which Harrison Wells and
    Tess Morgan
    launched the
    S.T.A.R. Labs particle accelerator
    in 2020, which is presumably what created the Speed Force in the first place.

    As a gift from
    Nash
    , the original Harrison Wells was reborn with the power to time travel at will. Harrison willingly puts himself in a loop of 1996 to 2000 to enjoy his time with Tess; being unable to alter time to save her from the crash (as Thawne would kill her anyway to keep his ruse going) and bring her to the 2020s.

    According to Harrison, he was originally to live 92 years before he was killed by Eobard, meaning he was meant to die sometime in either 2055 or 2056 (if his age is concurrent to his actor).

   <li key="65f0a17c-a1af-43a5-9734-149a02c7a47a">
    Wells shaking Cisco's hand before leaving is likely a nod to what would often happen with Eobard and Cisco, where Eobard would lift his hand before killing or threatening to kill Cisco by phasing his hand through his chest, as originally seen in "

    When the Speed Force is reborn, the bolt that shoots out separated into four different colors, which are likely the other Forces from the comics (
    Sage
    ,
    Still
    and
    Strength
    ), leaving the fourth unknown.

      The fourth could either be the Speed Force itself, or the Forever Force, which a Cosmic Force that would grant one control over everything and that the wielders of Speed, Sage, Strength and Still have gone to war over before.
