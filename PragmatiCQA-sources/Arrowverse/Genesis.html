  </p>
  <p key="b50b7b87-477e-4204-abcf-cc50132cc5cd">
   Fortuna uncovers that there is a path for Oliver to channel the intensity of light and expectation so as to repulse Darhk's passing filled enchantment. Oliver says he's there to discover that, yet Fortuna says that if the dimness inside him overwhelms the light, he'll fuel Darhk's enchantment as opposed to repulsing it.

   In the underground chamber, Fortuna is intending to hit Oliver with a low portion of Darhk's capacity. Oliver thinks about whether he needs a symbol or icon or something, yet she discloses to him that the tattoo Constantine gave him will do the trick. She hits him with a low portion of intensity and he's ready to repulse it by concentrating on the light inside himself, yet when she hits him with a higher portion, he goes inside his brain and sees himself battling a League of Assassins part, at that point Deathstroke, at that point Darhk. He streaks through all the horrible things that have transpired since the island, and when he comes out of the daze he's thumped over. Fortuna says he has an excess of haziness inside him to succeed, and she asks what she might instruct Oliver that would change what he saw. She says there's nothing she can accomplish for him.

   Thea understands that she doesn't have the foggiest idea where Alex said they were going for get-away.

   At the holding zone where Lyla is remaining with Sara, she shouts at Diggle when he returns. She cautions him that he's not acting like the man she wedded, yet the man she separated. She advises him to carry Andy to equity the correct way, and Diggle says he will.

  <p key="47f2e39c-0f92-4e14-a080-825173b3f296">
   At the club, Oliver says Fortuna is correct: the issue is with him, not with the enchantment. He understands that he's continually going to return to the individual he became on the island, much the same as Felicity said when she dumped him. Felicity discloses to him he's off-base and that she wasn't right when she said that, that everybody can change.

She understands that she's caught when she sees a few Ghosts, attempts to run from them, and bobs off an imperceptible divider.
