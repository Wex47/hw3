   In late 2019, Nash traveled to
   Earth-1
   in search of
   eternium
   . He broke into
   McCulloch Technologies
   in search of it and was caught on security cameras. He couldn't find any so he left empty-handed. The following day, Nash continued to track the eternium, when he was ambushed by
   Cisco Ramon
   and
   Iris West-Allen
   . He zipped lined down from where he was and pinned Cisco to the wall when he tried to introduce himself. Nash demanded to know why they were following him and pulled out a ruby that gives its victims nightmares and suggested this was the reason. Upon detecting eternium around Iris, he approached her. She promptly tasered him, and they took him back to

   Nash eventually awoke from the couch he was laying on, as Cisco and Iris went through his stuff. The two tried doing a do-over introduction, explaining they were friends of the Council of Wells; Nash was not impressed. He then used his sensor on Iris, telling her he let her taze him, but found little eternium on her. Nash explained that he was searching for eternium particles, which he had picked up on Iris, but realized they were stronger in the alley. Cisco sarcastically questioned if "Indiana" had to return the eternium to a certain god, but Nash simply told them there is no such thing as gods, just false ones and deduced that Cisco and Iris were no help so decided to leave.
  </p>
  <p key="ab679846-5482-4ce6-ac17-8fc02deaccc6">
   Cisco attempted to befriend Nash by telling this always happens with them and a new Wells: They get off to a rocky start, especially between him and Cisco, but eventually bond and the Wells embraces his sensitive side. So, Cisco suggested he drop his tough-guy act and skip to the end of their usual dance. Nash rejected this and swiftly deployed a
   smoke bomb
   . After their confrontation, he returned to the alley and located some eternium particles in a manhole.

   anti-vibrational crypto-circuit
   so he could complete his work on Earth-1.
  </p>
  <p key="f0726dca-8497-4da7-b0b4-670ee9930447">
   Barry questioned what Nash's work was and he told him it was thermic excavation. Barry and Cisco were wary of Nash, so they decided to talk in private about whether or not to trust him. Nash was still listening in on the bug and informed them that he could hear everything they said. After a brief spat, Barry told Nash they don't trust him, but asked what he was offering in exchange for their assistance. Nash told him he was offering something that will save Ramsey's life.
  </p>
  <p key="d6a3fa3e-1242-4f42-81cb-cb4229ce4543">
   Nash led them to
   McCulloch Technologies
   where he told they had a bio-regenerative serum that was capable of healing organic tissue, no matter the harm. He explained all they had to do was inject it into Ramsey's healthy cells, then those healthy cells would replicate and then replace the unhealthy cells. But, they shouldn't wait until Ramsey's condition worsened, or else it would be useless. Barry and Cisco questioned how McCulloch Technologies develop this, only for Nash to reveal they stole it from the
   Dominator
   invasion. While Barry went to disable the security cameras, Cisco questioned if this cure could be used on
   Antimatter
   , to which Nash replied that it obviously would.

  <p key="a58439ee-885d-43c2-a8ef-ef60ce0b9684">
   After Barry returned, the three began their break-in. Nash requested Barry to speed them to the cure, but the former revealed that there were

   dampeners all over the facility. When Barry and Cisco got trapped by the security guards, Nash used
   a device
   that made them faint for a while. When they arrived, Barry and Nash went to investigate a noise coming from outside while Cisco hacked the fridge the cure was in. When they returned, the cure was not in the fridge it was supposed to be as Cisco had stolen it and they failed to find it. With the guards closing in on them, Nash used a device to teleport them to S.T.A.R. Labs. Since he still collaborated with Barry and Cisco, Nash demanded that they make him the device he requested.
  </p>
  <p key="49519d26-18cc-44d6-b43e-242cdf1a5c3a">
   Upon receiving the device from Cisco, Nash felt it was shoddy workmanship, believing he's seen better on any of the other Earths he's been to. Having enough of Nash's attitude, Cisco grabbed a hold of him, to which Nash requested he never does again, and demanded that Nash leave. Before leaving, he bid farewell to
   Frost
   . He returned to the sewers and plugged the crypto-circuit into his tracker and activated it. It projected a hologram of Mar Novu walking to the end of the tunnel before vanishing. Nash smirked, finally finding the entrance to his realm, and began his excavation to the entrance.

Nash dismissed his detective skills when he called out how he spotted his police vehicle up top, to which Joe was impressed by. Joe then demanded to know why he was digging holes underneath
   Central City
   , but Nash refused to elaborate and attempted to attack him, only to accidentally trigger his gauntlet in the process and cause a cave-in.

  <p key="a8d776d5-7095-440d-95e8-53b8a8e55781">
   The two quickly recovered and Nash laughed at Joe's attempts to call for assistance when the sewer tunnel they were in was a dead zone long before the wall came down. Nash then tried to get them out of the mess they were in, but Joe assured him that since he as the captain of the
   Central City Police Department
   , they'll come looking for him if he didn't show up in a couple of hours. Ignoring Joe, Nash tried shooting their way out, only for the laser to bounce off the rocks and hit a gas line which briefly started a fire. Nash became furious and accused Joe of not telling him that Earth-1's vibrational frequency is calibrated at a molecular level. Nash then deduced that the fire sapped 87% of the oxygen in the room, which only left them with 42 minutes left to breathe.

   ex-wife
   left him and his daughter, he was broken. When neighbors showed up with cooked food for them, it was at that moment that Joe began to have faith in people. Nash began to consider that advice.

   Nash continued to work to blow them out, but Joe highly suggested not to because it could kill them. When Joe suggested waiting again, Nash demanded to know why he had so much faith. This caused Joe to break down and reveal Barry's fate to die in the

He then revealed that the only way to get through was by illuminating the wall using an artifact that could emit ultraviolet rays to reveal the eternium and identify which sections he couldn't strike.

   Nash knew she would return as she would get lost without him, so he waited for her to return. When she finally did, he asked why she was so freaked out overusing her powers. However, Nash decided to theorize the reason and deduced she was afraid to use her powers and become someone she hates. Allegra revealed the person to be her cousin

After listening to Harry Wells expressing his surprise to Barry's hesitation, Nash then lamented on how Barry was changing from his usual heroic ways and how angry he was that Barry contemplated killing him to get rid of Thawne.

Using the combined intelligence of some of his doppelg√§ngers, Nash realized that the team could power the artificial Speed Force with the multiversal particles that were made of synaptic energy that resided inside him. However, doing so would kill Nash since he would have to be the organic receptor for those particles. Nash didn't want to die, so he tried to come up with another way to power the artificial Speed Force.

   Chester then created a device that allowed Allegra to aim the multiversal particles back into Nash. Allegra was able to successfully push the particles out of Barry and back into Nash.

   Nash quickly took action and placed his hands on the fusion sphere, which started to absorb his multiversal particles.

Each Wells that had a close relationship with Barry then took time to say goodbye to him before Nash disintegrated. Barry then regained his speed and used it to stop the jet.
