    Early life

  </h4>
  <p key="ae6004cf-9973-4f63-b651-315592d3faaf">
   Felicity was born on July 24, 1989, to
   Donna Smoak
   and
   Noah Kuttler
   in
   Las Vegas
   , Nevada. She was raised in the
   Jewish
   faith by her mother.
   In her early childhood, Felicity had a teddy bear named Mr. Square Bear, who was her favorite stuffed toy. However, she lost the bear when she was four, upsetting her. Since then, Donna refers to any upset and perplexed expression on Felicity's face as her "Mr. Square Bear face".
   From a young age, Felicity displayed a genius intellect and became interested in computers, just like her father, whom she idolized. When she was only seven years old, Felicity built her first supercomputer using parts stolen from Noah's electronics collection.
  </p>
  <p key="dd1b7090-26ba-4d69-ad0a-5adda9072a63">
   Sometime afterwards, Felicity's father allegedly abandoned her and her mother to avoid going to prison. She was then raised solely by Donna, who worked long hours as a cocktail waitress to support them.
   While Felicity didn't remember Noah a lot, his absence from her life left a deep impact; growing up, Felicity struggled with intense self-loathing and abandonment issues, wondering if she somehow made her father leave and if anyone could truly love her. These insecurities would continue to linger in her adulthood, leaving Felicity with an innate fear of losing those important to her.
   Most likely stemming from this, she was implied to have had a pessimistic view on romance during her childhood; Felicity mentioned that she was never the type of girl who dreamt about her own wedding.
  </p>
  <p key="413dbdc3-bff3-4de6-aed0-2472449ec121">
   Felicity implied she didn't have many friends in Las Vegas.
  </p>
  <p key="87fca484-32f6-44af-a7fc-cbf7c874a8cb">
   As a child, Felicity wanted to be an astronaut and once begged her mother to let her go to Space Camp for the summer. However, Donna refused, claiming she couldn't bear thought of sending her daughter away for so long. In response, an upset Felicity locked herself in her room for two days.
   In the sixth grade, Felicity hacked
   Napster
   for her science fair project.
   When she was young, Felicity had a pet dog
   Lucky
   , whom she adored but initially struggled to house-train.
  </p>
  <p key="3457d98f-f43f-408b-b94c-02cfaaf2d7dd">
   Likely due to her mother's job, Felicity spent a lot of time in casinos, gaining intimate knowledge on how they worked. Subsequently, she become an excellent card counter and is implied to have successfully gotten away with winning money through this method several times.
  </p>
  <p key="766f4358-0f86-404c-b202-76f0f1795b33">
   Felicity was always fearful of winding up with a difficult, unfulfilling lifestyle like her mother and thus worked hard to escape from her circumstances and create a better future for herself.
   Over the years, Felicity's relationship with her mother became strained due to their differences (which she later regretted); Felicity felt that Donna only cared about the former's physical appearance and social life, while paying no attention to her academic achievements and goals. As a result, she put most of her focus into her studies, barely acknowledging her mother.
  </p>
  <p key="f4cf1fed-8c2e-4b6d-a824-5bb62e1a7a84">
   When she was 16, Felicity had her wisdom teeth removed. In the process, she gained a small scar in her mouth from a surgical wound that required three stitches.
   In high school, Felicity was Nevada's three-time state Mathletics champion (she intended it to be four, but freshmen weren't allowed to compete).

  <p key="f88e1ec1-b856-4f92-bd80-67ebff52764a">
   Felicity attended the
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology
   (MIT). She had an incident with a stalker lacrosse player in her freshman year.
   Also, as a freshman, Felicity once accidentally ate a pot brownie with nuts. She subsequently came down with an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital.
  </p>
  <p key="3b9046f3-d824-47ad-935f-6f94e522062c">
   During her senior year, Felicity dated fellow computer wiz
   Cooper Seldon
   . The two of them, along with Cooper's roommate
   Myron Forest
   , were members of a hacktivist group on campus and part of a cyber-goth subculture. The group would perform "civil disobedience via the World Wide Web", such as digitally defacing criminals, exposing government fraud, etc. Felicity would post her hacktivism on various web forums under the moniker “Ghost Fox Goddess”, eventually becoming an admired figure in the dark corners of the Internet. To coincide with her persona, she also personally adopted the goth look, dyeing her hair black and wearing dark leather clothes and makeup.
  </p>
  <p key="368736e3-70a5-4ff0-8b7a-8c7d1cfbe9c2">
   In 2008 when Felicity was 19, she was ranked 2nd in the National Information Technology Competition.
  </p>
  <p key="f18514ea-c4ae-4299-8e9f-da23a9eb4721">
   With help from Cooper and Myron, Felicity created an
   x-axis bi-numeric algorithm
   , a "super virus" capable of giving her root access to any infected server. The virus was originally intended for noble purposes in hacktivism. One day, the trio decided to hack into the
   <a href="United States (Earth-1).html" key="2852073a-f6e8-4d07-948f-546e32e53086" title="United States (Earth-1)">
    United States
   </a>
   Department of Education for fun. When Cooper located an exploitable entry point, Felicity used her virus to successfully bring down the firewall for 30 seconds. However, Cooper attempted to go further by deleting all student loans, much to Myron and Felicity's shock. Felicity stopped him by pulling the plug, angering the latter. Cooper told her she could either be a “hacker or hero” but not both.
  </p>
  <p key="454f23ff-b2aa-4d07-8f55-9f27e2b61dc3">
   Later that day, Felicity and Cooper strolled around campus, with the former fielding an unwelcome call from her mother. Cooper was still angry with her for interrupting his plan, to which Felicity worriedly revealed that she was trying to protect him; since the sub-root directory of the DOE network was configured, Cooper accessing the financial accounts meant someone could backtrace his hack. Right as the couple made up, the
   <a href="Federal Bureau of Investigation.html" key="1386c8d0-c3d8-4c26-a777-8a604bf39528" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">
    F.B.I.
   </a>
   arrived on campus to arrest Cooper and discovered Felicity's laptop - evidence of the DOE hack - in his backpack. Horrified, she tried to plead Cooper's innocence in vain as he was taken into custody.
  </p>
  <p key="120d0382-5864-41d1-b78c-1448703ed493">
   Felicity eventually decided to confess to the F.B.I. that she wrote the virus in order to free her boyfriend. While visiting Cooper in prison though, Felicity learned that he had already claimed sole accountability in both creating the virus and hacking the DOE, willingly taking the fall for her. She tried to protest this decision, but Cooper insisted it was the right thing to do since Felicity had no part in erasing the loans, leaving her helpless to do anything but accept his choice. Right before his sentencing, Cooper allegedly hung himself in his cell, much to Felicity's devastation.
  </p>
  <p key="ea32d45e-a0a5-4fb9-b43b-9115d3189350">
   Heartbroken and depressed over her boyfriend's death, Felicity initially considered turning herself in, feeling responsible for what happened since Cooper used her virus to hack the DOE. However, Myron dissuaded her, pointing out that if Felicity goes to prison, then Cooper would’ve died for nothing and advised her to instead take advantage of her second chance. Ultimately, Felicity decided to change her image and leave her hacktivist days behind. She dyed her hair blonde, started wearing glasses again, and overhauled her goth wardrobe with brighter, professional clothing. When Myron arrived at Felicity's dorm and saw her new look, he perplexedly wondered what happened to her. Felicity simply replied, "this is [her] now".

   Felicity graduated summa cum laude

   with a Master of Science in Computer Sciences and Cyber Security,
   specializing in virus creation.

   and proclaimed he was "cute", which led to Felicity babbling to herself, much to her annoyance. Unbeknownst to Felicity, Oliver himself was secretly hidden nearby listening to her. As she left, he smiled.

   In late 2012, Felicity was busy working in the I.T. Department when Oliver walked in. Upon introducing himself, Felicity accidentally mentioned his father

   's death, backtracking apologetically and ending up babbling at him, which amused Oliver. To her relief, he ignored her ramblings and gave Felicity a bullet-ridden laptop, claiming that he'd spilled a latte on it in a coffee shop located in a "bad neighborhood", though she clearly did not believe him. Felicity retrieved blueprints of the
   Exchange Building
   , where CEO
   Walter Steele
   would be bidding at the
   Unidac Industries
   auction. She also learned that the laptop belonged to one of Walter's competitors,
   Warren Patel

   Deadshot
   's employer.
  </p>
  <p key="82a3cc52-31a2-477c-97c1-22aa68504912">
   One night, Walter summoned Felicity up to his office. Felicity mistakenly believed she was going to be fired and began making a case about her importance to Queen Consolidated's technical department. However, Walter instead gave her a secret task off-books; he explained that a variance of $2.6 million had gone missing after an apparent failed investment by his wife,
   <a href="Moira Queen.html" key="d53354ce-2b35-4453-9796-81f6baf4f71c" title="Moira Queen">
    Moira Queen
   </a>
   and asked her to discreetly find out the details. Felicity agreed, proclaiming she was "[his] girl" for the job, and then babbled that she wasn't making a pass at Walter before leaving. During her investigation, Felicity unearthed that there was no investment as Moira claimed; the money in question had actually been used to set up an offshore limited liability company called
   Tempest
   . The organization, with no ties to the government or any other company, including Queen Consolidated, seemingly only existed to facilitate the purchase of a warehouse in 2009 that was located somewhere in
   <a href="Star City.html" key="1a74a572-f37f-4939-9642-626f5c80ec2a" title="Star City">

   . Felicity reported this to Walter and gave him the warehouse's address.
  </p>
  <p key="bb85dd86-ad76-4668-ae29-0c9eaeb2e109">
   Oliver visited Felicity to request she find the location of
   AK Desmond Group
   , claiming a friend of his worked there and he wanted to surprise her with a singing telegram. Felicity was unable to find any information using Google Search, so she did some hacking on the dark web, comparing her abilities to magic. Felicity then started rambling as she denied actually believing in magic until Oliver gently interrupted. Felicity quickly found the address of AK Desmond Group's headquarters at 1852 West Maple, 30th floor and gave it to Oliver, accidentally dropping her red pen in the process. Before he left, Oliver returned the pen to her, revealing to Felicity that he does believe in magic. Oliver used Felicity's intel to confront and kill
   Justin Claybourne
   .
  </p>
  <p key="4256cddb-4b17-437e-ac4a-07beda412422">
   Felicity researched
   Derek Reston

    John Diggle

   , musing her new job as "personal Internet researcher for Oliver Queen". Although she clearly disbelieved Oliver's excuse that he and Derek were old friends, Felicity's research unearthed the fact that Derek was an employee of Robert's at
   Queen Industrial Inc.
   until laid off when the factory was sold. This prompted Oliver to reach out and offer Derek a second chance.
  </p>
  <p key="f3bc6bd5-2861-4def-97f8-048cb3b21b14">
   After Walter returned from a business trip to
   Melbourne
   ,
   Australia
   , Felicity went his office to speak with him about her discovery of another entity (
   <a href="Malcolm Merlyn.html" key="8279d7c6-e2d3-4146-9f6e-d13d819aa0ce" title="Malcolm Merlyn">
    Malcolm Merlyn

   ) shadowing Moira's $2.6 million transaction regarding Tempest. Felicity showed Walter a picture (the symbol of
   <a href="The List.html" key="55fcb66b-76d9-4457-bb9e-3119a1536ec8" title="The List">
    The List
   </a>
   ) she managed to uncover from tracing the entity. Walter denied having seen the symbol before and coldly warned Felicity to stop looking into his wife's affairs, promising to suspend her if she continued (to keep her safe).
  </p>
  <p key="c381c924-8a6d-495d-9c3d-4cbab2a6a992">
   Later though, Felicity was called back to Walter's office, where he gave her a seemingly blank copy of The List and asked her to investigate the notebook. Walter cautioned Felicity that the last person he asked, the company's head of security
   Josiah Hudson
   , was killed. Felicity simply responded, "I hate mysteries. They bug me, they need to be solved." A few hours later, Felicity returned to Walter's office with The List and a pair of glasses manufactured by the
   Robert Queen Applied Sciences Center
   , which allowed them to see a list of names written in subsonic ultraviolet invisible ink.
  </p>
  <p key="f3f878d9-97b6-44ac-abf1-759437b18dc6">
   Around
   Christmas
   , Felicity discovered that

    the Hood
   </a>
   had targeted seven names from The List. She called Walter to warn him that
   Doug Miller
   , the head of Applied Sciences, may be in danger since his name was on The List as well, prompting Walter to meet with him. Later, while looking at the names she'd copied onto her tablet, Oliver arrived to ask for Felicity's help again. Claiming that his friend "Steve" is a fan of archery, Oliver gave Felicity an arrow to track down where it had been manufactured under the pretense of buying more arrows for "Steve"'s birthday.
  </p>
  <p key="c524eea5-e68f-4d25-8cdc-f7d16b94a1a8">
   Felicity learned the arrow's patent was registered to a company called
   Sagittarius
   (Latin for "the archer") and after hacking into their records, discovered the address where 200 units of the same arrows were delivered. Upon providing him with the information, an awed Oliver praised that she was "remarkable" and wished her a Merry Christmas before he left, prompting Felicity to reveal her
   Jewish
   heritage. Oliver corrected himself, wishing her a Happy
   Hanukkah
   .
  </p>
  <p key="47943378-0eb7-44f7-bfc2-4a05bf1eec79">
   Several weeks later in January 2013, Felicity was having lunch in the I.T. department when Oliver arrived and asked her to decrypt the information stored on a security fob of
   Blackhawk Squad Protection Group
   , claiming it was part of a friend's scavenger hunt set up by the latter's bodyguard which would award a case of Château Lafite Rothschild 1982 to the winner. Declaring her love of red wine and being promised one of the bottles, Felicity began to de-crypt the fob. The next day, she discovered that it contained a directory of schedules and preparations regarding several planned heists similar to the armored-car robberies that had been occurring in the city. Oliver asked her to hold off on warning the
   <a href="Star City Police Department.html" key="9fae8a4b-db60-40cf-9cd8-ca3fe89056bf" title="Star City Police Department">
    SCPD
   </a>
   , saying he didn't want to get her in trouble, and requested that she send him the directory instead. Felicity did so, privately expressing her disappointment at the lack of wine coming her way.
  </p>
  <p key="a8b94fc0-8824-453d-b8bf-69d31af137cd">
   A week later, Oliver and John arrived at Queen Consolidated to see Felicity and she expressed slight concern over a "hungover" Oliver. Oliver handed her a syringe, asking her to run a spectro-analysis on what he claimed was an energy drink (but was in fact
   Vertigo
   ) manufactured by his friend "Kevin" to cure hangovers. Felicity questioned him on why the energy drink was in a syringe, and then walked away exasperatedly when Oliver told her he "ran out of sports bottles". She discovered the water in the sample came from an abandoned juvenile center in the East sector of
   the Glades
   .
  </p>
  <p key="d72553ad-5838-4fbb-b5b4-0c5a9bd69206">
   The next night, Felicity contacted Oliver and asked him to meet her at
   Big Belly Burger
   . Once she arrived, Felicity admitted that despite the outrageous cover stories Oliver had told her when asking for her help, she somehow trusted him enough to share the information she had collected. Felicity presented Oliver with the copy of The List in her possession, which he claimed to have never seen before. Felicity revealed the notebook belonged to Moira and admitted it may be connected to Walter's disappearance.

   However, he had been kidnapped by someone else, so Felicity began looking into anyone who would potentially have a grudge against Nickel. She eventually discovered Nickel being broadcasted live on a website,
   Glades Betrayed

   The next day as Felicity worked to decrypt Glades Betrayed, Diggle learned through a contact in the

   Gavin Carnahan
   had been kidnapped next. The Savior accused Carnahan of failing to prosecute the robbers who murdered his wife in a bodega heist.

However, she was unable to pinpoint where the transmission was being sent from and erroneously directed Oliver to 23rd and Myra, then Ocean and Grand. A frustrated Oliver demanded Felicity to find the signal but The Savior shot and killed Carnahan, shocking and upsetting Felicity. Diggle tried to talk to her, but Felicity ordered him to leave her alone using her "loud voice".

Felicity revealed that Lawton made a series of calls to Alberto Garcia, who arranged the assassin's hits, and gave him a USB of information. She tried to convince Diggle to let Oliver in on the secret, but he refused and left. Later after tracking the drug money's destination, Felicity sent Oliver the address but he failed to capture the dealers.

   The next night, Oliver and Felicity heard a report about a Vertigo-related hostage-taking incident in the
   Starling City Aquarium

   Later, Felicity walked into the Arrowcave to find that the equipment had been replaced with the Verdant's inventory and furniture. She questioned this and wondered where Diggle was, to which Oliver answered that it was a "long story". Directed to look at the autopsy report of the addict from the aquarium, Felicity discovered that the man didn't die of a Vertigo overdose, but from an allergic reaction to chlorpromazine, an anti-psychotic. Upon checking Veronica's autopsy, Felicity discovered traces of chlorpromazine in her system as well.

   Oliver realized that the amount of anti-psychotic drugs needed to manufacture the new Vertigo could only be found in a mental institution and promptly left Felicity in the Arrowcave to recheck the psychiatric hospital. Upon getting in touch with Diggle, Felicity informed him of Oliver's whereabouts. Oliver and Diggle discovered that The Count's psychiatrist, Dr.

She managed to track it to
   Dominic Alonzo

With Oliver hesitating to both storm Alonzo's place due to the unknown amount of security guarding the place and his unwillingness to contact John for help, Felicity convinced him to let her get caught counting cards in order to place a bug on Alonzo's computer. Despite his reservations, Oliver bent to Felicity's tenacity but insisted that he plan the mission, which she agreed to.

   Before the mission, Felicity paid a visit to John to try and convince him to help them save Walter, but to no avail. Sometime later, she and Oliver arrived outside Alonzo's casino, where Oliver gave her another chance to back out. When Felicity refused to do so, he assured her that he'd be right outside, and they separated. With Oliver scouting ahead and providing her the password (snapdragon) Felicity headed in, detailing how many of Alonzo's employees were in sight and also accidentally rambling at him, much to her chagrin.

Having lost contact with her, Oliver stormed the casino and, after getting Felicity out of Alonzo's clutches, reverted to his old method of intimidating his target into confessing the information he wanted. Alonzo claimed that he heard the gunshot which killed Walter, devastating Felicity and Oliver.

Oliver and Felicity escaped through a window, swinging once again via a chain out the window and into another two floors below, escaping The Hoods. After the attack, Felicity confronted Oliver for not even trying to stop the Hoods, and he responded by citing the bodycount he typically left behind. After Oliver discovered that the Hoods kidnapped Thea, he, Felicity and John went to the upgraded lair.

   Felicity helped Oliver find out information about the Hoods, why they formed, and their location. She then gave Oliver his new bow, which she personally designed. Back at the hideout, after Oliver defeated the Hoods, they talked about a new way and a new name for the Hood, naming himself the Arrow.

   When Oliver promoted Felicity to his executive assistant, she vehemently protested her new position, to which Oliver explained that he needed to keep her close to him due to "how [they] spend [their] nights". Felicity inevitably stayed on as his assistant, but made it clear she despised her new job and wouldn't resort to typical secretarial duties such as fetching coffee. To stop the

   Because of all the times Felicity hacked the SCPD, they'd outsourced their evidence to a facility that she couldn't hack into from the outside. Oliver and Lance broke into the facility and gave Felicity the connection she needed to retrieve and disseminate the information there, leading to a break in the case. It turned out that all the women used a special type of skin cream called
   Mermaiden
   , and her skills left Lance mystified at the thought that she can discover all of that with what little information she'd been given in less than a minute, prompting Oliver to smile under the cover of his hood.

  <p key="104612ab-d817-43a4-9529-98cb14e6b993">
   She then volunteered to be bait for the Dollmaker, going to each boutique and buying Mermaiden. Quentin pointed out that Felicity must trust The Arrow a lot to be bait for a serial killer. Creeped out, and scared, she vowed to never be bait again, right before she was attacked by the Dollmaker. The Arrow and Quentin scared him off, but not before Felicity was injured. When she'd recovered, she reported the kidnapping of Quentin and Laurel to Oliver, and managed to provide him with their location.

   When Oliver was late to a Queen Consolidated investment party at the

   Later while watching Oliver and Laurel speak during the party, Felicity realized that Laurel had also been in the same two places where the masked blonde vigilante had helped Oliver out, leading her to theorize that it was Laurel, not Oliver, whom the woman was following. This revelation allowed Oliver to track the woman and learn her real identity:

  <p key="5f9a0022-72ba-4d87-b9ea-654e3ebf8d0c">
   An upset Oliver pointed out that because nothing good happened on the island, they were better off not knowing. Later, they set aside the Sara issue to locate
   the Mayor's hideout

   Felicity and Diggle finally met the elusive Sara and the former expressed her happiness regarding Sara's survival despite not having known her before the shipwreck. This amused Sara, who called Felicity "cute". Oliver told them that he and Sara were attacked inside the Queen Mansion by a man dressed like the Dark Archer, then asked Felicity to analyze a bag of dirt the man had tracked in. Hearing their lack of knowledge on the matter, Sara revealed that the man was named
   Al-Owal
   , a member of the
   <a href="League of Assassins (Earth-1).html" key="7fba39c8-284c-478c-be4c-d10a95a7559b" title="League of Assassins (Earth-1)">

   sent to bring her back with him, as she too was a member. Sara admitted to murdering
   a diplomat
   who was later found by his young children and used it as an example as to why she kept her survival a secret from her family. Later, when Sara apologized to Felicity for upsetting her with her confession, Felicity compared Sara's regret for joining the League of Assassins to her regret of joining a gym membership. Sara thanked Felicity for not making her feel like "what she was" and expressed how lucky Oliver was for having both her and John as friends.

  <p key="747d59cd-1bba-4583-ac5c-5bae9d98cfd6">
   When Oliver arrived, Felicity reported that she'd found pesticide on the dirt he gave her, giving them Al-Owal's possible
   hideout
   . After Sara and Oliver failed to deter him, Felicity volunteered to warn Officer Lance about the possible threat on his life. She confronted Lance at his apartment after his shift, and Lance was seemingly disgruntled by not only her request but her vague explanation. Lance refused to listen to her, believing that he wasn't in any real danger. Felicity returned to the Arrowcave, announcing her failure, forcing Sara to reveal herself to her father.

   Felicity arrived when Isabel was reprimanding Oliver for his lack of interest in the company. Felicity apologized for interrupting, reminding Oliver about his "evening plans". She told him that "Mr. Harper" had information for him while a disbelieving and irritated Isabel listened. Oliver then told Felicity that she needed to work on her excuses. She later went with Oliver, Diggle, and unexpectedly Isabel to

   Unbeknownst to her, Isabel believed she's sleeping with Oliver because of her abrupt job change and asks Oliver multiple times about it. While in the hotel, Felicity helped orchestrate Diggle's capture and coordinated the rendezvous point for his escape. Later that night, Felicity went to fetch Oliver from his hotel room, only to find Isabel exiting his room. As Isabel left, she looked back over her shoulder and said to Oliver, "i think she can take the night off". Hurt by what Isabel implied, Felicity was visibly shocked by what happened.

After the mission succeeded, Diggle, Lyla, Felicity, Oliver, and Isabel returned to Starling City in Oliver's private jet. Despite saying "what happens in Russia stays in Russia" while in Moscow, she confronted Oliver about Isabel at Queen Consolidated, suggesting that she had feelings for him. Oliver gently explained that due to his vigilantism, he believed "it's better to not... be with someone that [he] could really care about", implying that he might have romantic feelings for Felicity as well, but wouldn't act on them. Felicity voiced her belief that Oliver deserved better and walked off in tears.

   Felicity took Diggle to the Arrowcave when he passed out in the office and immediately called Oliver. Calling in a favor from a chemist at Queen Consolidated, Felicity had a sample of Diggle's blood analyzed and learned it contained traces of Vertigo. When Oliver arrived, Felicity explained that Diggle had somehow been injected with the drug and his condition was the effects of severe withdrawal.

   As Oliver was occupied with his mother's on-going trial, Felicity worked with an ill Diggle to try to figure out why a random mix of people were infected. After plotting out the employment of each infected person, she found a path and linked that path to the free flu shots that were given around the city. Since Diggle was out of commission and Oliver was at the trial, Felicity decided to check out the immunization truck on her own, and was subsequently abducted by Count Vertigo.

Later, Felicity thanked Oliver for saving her life, then apologized for being the reason he had to choose to kill someone again. Oliver simply assured her that "there was no choice to make" since her life was in danger.

During the course of their time together, Felicity exhibited signs of being attracted to Barry, though she was clearly uncomfortable when he mentioned his admiration of the Arrow and his theory that the vigilante had partners, particularly one versed in computer science.

Felicity and John came to Oliver's rescue, and when she was unable to discover what Oliver was poisoned with, John decided to call 911, despite Oliver being in full vigilante garb. Felicity stopped him from making the call, instead asking John to abduct Barry at the train station to ask for his help in saving Oliver.

When Oliver woke up, he was upset to discover that Felicity had exposed his secret to an outsider without his consent, to which she protested that his life was in danger. The two had a heated argument, which Barry diffused by pointing out that Oliver was unnecessarily being "a jerk" to Felicity, who only wanted to save Oliver.

   Big Belly Burger
   to get some takeout. They returned with John to find the Arrowcave in disarray, though Oliver denied that they'd had a break-in and didn't explain what happened. After Barry told Oliver that his hallucinations weren't being caused by any drugs in his system, Felicity found a police report detailing Quentin's injuries and the death of several officers, including Quentin's former partner and friend,

Felicity soon felt insecure and left out again when Sara revealed her aptitude for chemistry, genetics, and computers to study Tockman's blood. Together, Felicity and Sara were able to determine that Tockman had
   MacGregor's Syndrome
   and identify him. Felicity discovered that Tockman's sister,
   Beverly Tockman
   , was suffering from Cystic Fibrosis and all the money he stole was to pay for her lung transplant. Based on his sister's address, the Arrow and the Canary tracked Tockman down. However, this proved to be a trap, as Tockman waited for Felicity to hack the device he had planted and was able to backtrack and trace the computer system to the

   As an upset Felicity assessed the damage, Oliver told her to call Walter and liquidate 800,000 shares of Queen Consolidated as bait for Tockman. After Oliver and Sara left, Diggle tried to get Felicity to open up about her thoughts regarding Oliver's relationship with Sara, implying that she's feeling upset because of her growing feelings for Oliver. Felicity denied it and explained to Diggle her uncertainty of herself within the team due to Sara's abilities, feeling extra pressure to take Tockman down. Diggle tried to affirm to Felicity that she's "irreplaceable". After Felicity placed the liquidated shares into Oliver's account at
   Starling National Bank
   , Tockman quickly took their bait, and she tried to stop him alone. Oliver, Sara, and Diggle managed to find her before Tockman did, but while Oliver dealt with Tockman's men and Diggle stopped a gas main from exploding, Felicity and Sara found Tockman. Felicity took a bullet for Sara and was shot in the shoulder. Using the same virus that fried her systems, Felicity used Tockman's phone to knock him out.

Oliver asked if she had really been feeling left out and Felicity admitted that she had gotten used being Oliver's "girl-girl". Oliver assured her that she would always be his girl.

Sara heard Slade's voice and realized that Oliver and his family were in immanent danger. When the rest of the team left, Felicity used thermal imaging software to track the movements of Thea, Moira, and Slade on their tour of the house, therefore directing Diggle, Sara, and Roy on their mission throughout the Queen Mansion.

When Diggle commented on how much work that was, Felicity simply replied, "It's Thea".

Roy became angry at Oliver and blamed him for Thea's kidnapping, attacking Diggle in his fury while Felicity tried in vain to calm him down. Just then, Felicity received an alert from

Later, stationed in a van rather than the Arrocave, Felicity directed Diggle to plant a bomb on a bridge that would kill all of Slade's soldiers. Before the charge was set, she reminded Oliver how hard he'd worked not to kill anyone. Cisco then called Felicity from

She pinged his phone, and she, Diggle, and Oliver drove the van to find his location. On their way, however, Slade's soldiers managed to crash the van. Felicity was the most severely injured of the three, being knocked unconscious by a head wound. Oliver carried her until she could walk, but by that time, the cure had already been taken by Slade.

She is, at first, wary of his knowledge of the hardware he's purchasing, but soon makes small talk about hacking and finds out they have something in common. He reveals that he knows who she is and asks her what she's doing working there. She asks him how he knows who she is. The man doesn't answer her question, but instead tells her that he knows someone who wants to hire someone with her expertise. She says she's not looking for a job right now although it's clear that even she thinks that it's stupid of her not to be looking for a job in her field. She advises the man to wait a bit longer to buy the hacking hardware he wants so he can get the newer version, handing him a leaflet for the TX50 which comes out in a month. In the meantime, she gives him the URL of a website that is a better way to hack into his target and wishes him "happy hacking".

   Green Arrow suit
   for Oliver, designed by Cisco. Oliver discovered that the leader of the Ghosts was

   A week after Green Arrow's broadcast, Felicity continued to help Team Arrow while they tried to stop the Ghosts from setting off a bomb. That morning, she went to Palmer Technologies for the first time as the new CEO, only to realize from the board of directors that the company was failing and employee

   Lonnie Machin
   tried to kill mayoral candidate
   Jessica Danforth
   on behalf of Damien, Felicity helped Oliver buy a truck which Machin left his fingerprints on so the team could get a match. On the fingerprints, she found traces of cellulose from
   Palmer Paper
   , a former subsidiary of Palmer Tech. However, Green Arrow and Speedy's mission to locate Machin at Palmer Paper went awry when Thea began displaying a bloodlust due to the
   Lazarus Pit
   . Felicity then discovered Machin's identity as a former mob enforcer.

  <p key="e82cee01-deb1-4579-a429-8d5048c67727">
   The next day at Palmer Tech, Felicity learned she had to fire two dozen employees, including Curtis, much to her disappointment. As she worked to locate Jessica's daughter
   Madison
   , whom Machin had kidnapped, Felicity lamented to Oliver on the undesirable circumstances in both their personal and professional lives despite their hope for a new beginning. Oliver assured her they just needed time to figure out how to make that happen, meaningfully citing that "nothing worthwhile ever comes easy". After the team rescued Madison, Felicity rehired all 24 employees at Palmer Tech, claiming to the board that she and Curtis are working on revolutionary technology which would turn the company's prospects around, betting that Curtis can follow through by the next shareholders' meeting. Back at the loft, Oliver confided in Felicity that he was failing at doing things differently than as The Arrow and revealed he intends to run for mayor.

   Sometime later, Felicity, Oliver, and Diggle worked to capture a group of Ghosts, with the former reminiscing when it used to be just the three of them in Team Arrow. Diggle managed to secure an escaped Ghost's cyanide capsule tooth. In the Arrowcave, Felicity placed the tooth in the DNA sequencer to hopefully learn the Ghost's identity. She suggested they celebrate this promising lead by going out for drinks at the same bar they went to following their defeat of
   the Dodger
   . However, Diggle refused, still angry with Oliver. Felicity assured Oliver that he just needed time, but Oliver gave up hope of Diggle ever forgiving him.

   Later, Oliver and Felicity track what seemed to be a break-in. Oliver decided to go in without backup, much to Felicity's chagrin. He encountered a meta human named
   Jeremy Tell/Double Down
   , who could use the card tattoos on his bodies as lethal projectiles, and barely escaped with his life. Back at the Arrowcave, Felicity tended to Oliver's injuries and called both him and Diggle out for not having each other's backs, as they both were nearly killed tonight due to operating alone. Felicity demanded that they mend their friendship or else. She then took the card Double Down attacked Oliver with to Palmer Tech so Curtis could analyze it for anything that could be used to stop him.

   Felicity noticed her phone had been acting up a lot recently and also requested Curtis to decrypt its messages. Suddenly, the two were attacked by Double Down, who tracked them down through his card, and demanded the location of Green Arrow. Felicity and Curtis fled down to the Arrowcave, causing the latter to discover her work with

Oliver and Diggle ambushed and managed to capture Double Down, repairing their friendship in the process. The trio later went out for drinks, with Oliver revealing that he had a surprise for them.

   Felicity arrived to the new lair and was questioned by Thea when she wasn't wearing something (Oliver's proposal ring). Oliver announced to the team his plan to run for mayor, with Felicity having

Later at Palmer Tech, she deflected questions from Curtis about the Green Arrow's identity and handed him her malfunctioning phone, initially thinking that Curtis was trying to prank her. Curtis noticed the code on her phone was the same as code used in Ray's exosuit.

  <p key="69d1619f-6e4b-42f9-8d32-fbadd8886389">
   When Curtis figured out the code's message, Felicity left, not wanting to relive her ex-boyfriend's death. She returned to the

   and tracked a sim card to a warehouse, where the team discovered police equipment and weapons from the Anti-Vigilante Task Force. Felicity tracked gang activity and discovered a pattern with big drug deals getting hit by the rogue cops, prompting the team to set up a drug bait of their own. They debriefed at the lair where Quentin tells them the equipment they used was former anti-vigilante task force gear and that he would give Felicity access to

   Liza Warner
   as the culprit. When Quentin was captured by Warner's crew, she tracked Quentin to an SCPD facility. Felicity later witnessed Oliver's announcement of his mayoral campaign to the public.

  <p key="ca560dfa-d0dd-40dc-b656-1d5b4f4dd40b">
   At Palmer Technologies, Felicity asked Curtis to look into Ray's messages, thinking there may be something hidden. Felicity then alerted Thea and Oliver about a blonde woman attacking a nightclub, who turned out to be a resurrected, soulless

   . Felicity later asked Oliver about how Sara could still be alive and tells him about Ray's last message. Oliver reminisced with her about his lost loved ones and told her how much he would want to spent another minute with them but that Sara's case was different. She and Oliver reviewed the victims of her attacks and realized that Sara was targeting women who resembled.

  <p key="6ad86a13-3bb3-417f-b8f9-e781a0514f10">
   After Sara attacked Thea at Laurel's apartment, Felicity and Oliver stood by her bedside at the hospital, where Thea revealed Sara was suffering from side-effects of the Lazarus Pit, similar to her. The team later regrouped at the Arrowcave when Sara attacked Thea again and devised a plan using Thea as bait to lure Sara out. When the team was successful in capturing Sara, Oliver called in a favor from

Felicity was upset that Oliver didn't show the same sense of urgency, but eventually agreed. Just then, she got an alert that her algorithm finished back-tracing Ray's message. Ray contacted them, revealing he was being held against his will and had shrunken in size.

   Kord Industries
   . Donna then arrived at the lab, having been invited to town by Oliver. Thrown off, Felicity got a car to take her mother to the loft while she aided Team Arrow, including a rejoined Sara, in stealing the quantum manifold. During the mission, Felicity told off Oliver for texting her mother behind her back, much to the rest of the team's amusement. The heist was successful, though Sara briefly lost control. Afterwards, Ray contacted Felicity again but before he could tell her anything, Damien Darhk arrived and she lost contact.

  <p key="0dd3eb0c-dd7e-40bb-bcbc-2e517c7b5199">
   After discussing Sara's condition with Oliver and John, Felicity wondered what they should do next. Oliver informed her that they would have to wait until Quentin gave them the location of Darhk's hideout where Ray was being held and he had already made dinner plans for them with Donna in the meantime, much to Felicity's exasperation. Things quickly became tense between Felicity and Oliver at the loft so Donna left to get takeout. When Oliver wondered why she was being so withdrawn, Felicity revealed that she blamed herself for getting so caught up in their relationship that she uprooted her life in Star City to travel the world with Oliver, causing her to miss Ray's initial distress calls and not investigate his apparent death more thoroughly. After Oliver decided to give her some space, Felicity and her mother talked. Felicity admitted that she's afraid of losing herself in Oliver, but Donna assured her that is how love is supposed to feel and soon, they would find themselves in each other.

   Later, Felicity regrouped with Team Arrow and they planned to infiltrate Darhk's hideout at the
   Latin Building
   . In the field, Felicity accompanied Curtis as he assembled the machine. They found Ray and successfully resized him. Back at the Arrowcave, Felicity gave Ray a checkup before taking him home. Afterwards at the loft, she and Oliver made up, newly confident in their future, and shared a romantic night.

   After the team was unsuccessful in preventing
   H.I.V.E.
   from destroying an armored truck full of cash, Felicity headed to work to get Ray to help with their case. She gave him a tooth from a Ghost that only contained half of the genetic markers. Ray found out the cause of the degraded DNA was due to a chemical patented by
   Wolfman Biologics
   . After the police gala, Felicity disagreed with Oliver's plan to use his mayoral campaign to get into H.I.V.E. Felicity checked in on Ray who hadn't left the loft. She encouraged him to start living in public again but he didn't agree. He then showed her his results on his analyses of the tooth, tracking residue on the tooth to Muller Psychiatric Center. Felicity monitored the team with new infrared cameras from Curtis Holt that were able to identify Andy amongst the masked Ghosts and they successfully recovered Andy.

   At Oliver's Star City Bay cleanup event, Felicity and Laurel educated a group of children on ocean conservation. Suddenly, the crowd was attacked by a drone with gunfire. Felicity was able to hack into the drone and disable it. Later at the loft, Felicity met with her mother, who was visiting for the holidays. While searching through boxes of holiday decorations, Donna found Oliver's proposal ring and showed Felicity. Felicity later supported Oliver's plan to expose

   She later spotted her mom at the party making out with Quentin. She told her mom about Oliver's non-proposal and confronted Oliver about it. Damien Darhk and his men suddenly crashed the party and kidnapped Felicity, Thea, and Diggle. Oliver turned himself in to Damien in exchange for his friends and was brought to Felicity. Felicity spoke to Oliver about his decision not to propose and that she would have accepted. Damien then took her and put her into a gas chamber with Thea and Diggle. After Malcolm and Laurel's timely arrival, Laurel's Canary Cry shattered the glass enough for Oliver to break the glass and rescue everyone. During a follow up campaign event at the Star City Bay, he proposed to Felicity, who accepted. They left on a limo where it was attacked by H.I.V.E.'s

After Felicity got out of surgery, Oliver arrived to the hospital and was told by Donna that her spinal cord was permanently damaged. He left but his team forced him to visit Felicity. Felicity tried to give Oliver the ring back, but he assured her that their commitment to each other was for better or worse. She also reminded him not to lose himself in his quest for revenge on Darhk. Oliver suggested they travel to Bali to get away from Star City, but Felicity insisted they should stay in Star City until Darhk was defeated.

   Felicity returned home to the loft, being carried by Oliver. Felicity insisted that he didn't have to tend to her and should be focusing on going after Darhk instead. She also said that due to her injuries, she was considering leaving Team Arrow. Oliver assured her that she was still an important member of the team. After Oliver left, Felicity started hallucinating, speaking to her younger self who was taunting her about her injured condition. Oliver contacted her while in the field and convinced her to help them break into Pacific Freeport where
   Shadowspire
   was based. During the raid, Felicity tripped a fail-safe causing Oliver to become trapped in a shipping container, but he got out and the team left. When Oliver came back to the loft, Felicity blamed herself for the screw-up but Oliver told her he shouldn't have pushed her back into action without her being fully ready.

   However, Felicity felt she could no longer be a part of the team. Her hallucination self then started taunting her again prompting Felicity to lash out, so a confused Oliver left her to be alone. Her hallucination started telling her that the blonde hair, glasses, and desire to a hero was all just a mask to cover up the real her. Felicity later went to the lair and told Oliver that being a hero was who she really was and that what happened to her was neither of their faults. Feeling better, Felicity assisted

The two reflected on how much they'd grown and Felicity burned the photo as a symbolic gesture of letting the past remain in the past. Oliver then promised Felicity that he would find a way to make her walk again.

   Team Arrow pursued a thief who stole what Felicity later identified as a network mapper from

During a practice of her presentation in front of Curtis and Mr. Dennis, she flopped. Dennis suggested that due to her condition, she should relegate the presentation duties to someone else. After the thief struck again, the team found out it was

   the Calculator
   found him in
   Hub City
   and blackmailed him to steal the web-nuke components. Felicity then hacked into the Calculator's system but he back-traced it and hacked her system as well. They talked with each other; Felicity tried to get him to reveal his plan, which he said was to take down a city. The Calculator then blocked her.

  <p key="e31d6430-6b0f-4412-bb76-23b336f64b16">
   Felicity realized his plan could be accomplished by using the web-nuke to overload electric grids and water mains to kill everyone in Star City. She remembered that Ray had built a battering ram that could be used to re-enter the Calculator's system. She arrived at work and whipped around Curtis's lab to find Ray's battering ram. Curtis noted that the way she came into the lab with a purpose was the type of attitude that she needed to run the company and present the power cell to the board. She was then able to trace the Calculator's web nuke to the Flint Hill Data Farm. After a prolonged hacking battle between her and the Calculator, Felicity told Team Arrow that the web-nuke was hardwired in. Roy was able to manually set off the charge, stop the bomb, and escape. She was also able to install a virus that wiped out all of his information on Roy. Using her newfound spirit, Felicity was able to successfully dazzle the board with her presentation of the new power cell. After the presentation, she was approached by her father, much to her shock.

   At Noah's insistence, Felicity reluctantly agreed to have coffee with her father. Noah revealed to Felicity that he was the Calculator and knew his daughter was Overwatch. He also tried to explain himself to Felicity, claiming that he was not a bad guy and gave her a record of his hacks in order to win back her trust. Felicity had her mother come to Star City where she told Donna that Noah was in town and that she had spoken to him.

  <p key="f0ad8b6e-c38f-4329-8649-aff528216cf8">
   Donna remarked that Noah would only have reached out to Felicity for an ulterior motive and that he only tells you what you want to hear. Felicity brought him to Palmer Tech's R&amp;D lab, where she talked with her father about how his story checked out and they conversed about her work. Noah thanked Felicity for giving him a second chance. However, Felicity found an IR burst receiver left behind by her father that was designed to siphon all the data out of a room. Felicity confided in Oliver about this, disappointed that her father hadn't really changed. Felicity then joined Team Arrow in witnessing a trial by combat between Malcolm and Nyssa (later replaced by Oliver). The next day, Felicity had her father arrested at Palmer Tech.

After helping her mother prepare for an engagement party at the loft, Felicity tracked down another possible H.I.V.E. base. She also had a talk with her mom about how the people closest to them sometimes keep secrets to protect them. She then brought Curtis a laptop from the Demolition Team's hideout that Thea recovered and had him analyze it.

After the debate, Felicity and Oliver's engagement party started. Curtis arrived to the party and gave her his engagement gift, which was a
   bio-stimulant implant

   Felicity worked with Paul in physical therapy to see if Curtis's implant worked. She struggled, but Paul told her that she just needed time. Felicity told Oliver that she believed the implant wouldn't work. Damien then walked in on them and held Oliver in place with telekinesis. Damien revealed that he had William hostage and gave Oliver the ultimatum that he drop out of the race. Oliver then told Felicity that the boy was his son,

   Samantha
   work on a search profile for William. As they worked, Samantha assured Felicity that Oliver wanted to tell her about William and asked her to remember that it was the former who put him in that position. Despite Samantha's confession, Felicity decided that she needed space and that Oliver should have told her about William. She felt that Oliver didn't know how to trust her. Suddenly, Felicity began to walk again and she promptly walked out of the loft, leaving the ring behind.

   Felicity had made extraordinary progress in her rehab and had coordinated a complex system of moving boxes out of the loft. When the subject of her being on Team Arrow came up, Oliver reassured her that she was always going to be a part of the team. She then asked him to cancel the wedding venue. The team next went after
   Carrie Cutter

   Felicity examined it and found it contained chemicals used in wedding dress storage. She tracked Carrie's probable location to a Colao Wedding Dress Services facility. The team raided the facility and found Carrie's shrine, including a news clipping of Oliver and Felicity's engagement. Oliver had the idea to have a fake wedding to draw Carrie out. Felicity thought it was a stupid and dangerous idea, but ultimately went along with it. At the ceremony, Felicity gave her brief vows. Oliver then gave his, saying that she helped him see the light inside of him and that he wanted the chance to be in her life.

  <p key="5d076dc4-5146-4016-b12c-7d6b9f7b9f15">
   Carrie then attacked the couple. Carrie shot Oliver with an arrow but he recovered and they both convinced her that love wasn't dead, but real. Felicity told Carrie how much Oliver meant to her and was able to talk her down long enough for Thea and John to disarm and tie her up. Afterwards, Oliver told her what he said at the sham wedding was true and that he would never lie to her again, but Felicity told him that they couldn't be together because he would always default to keeping secrets. She then told him that she would be leaving the team and that they would carry on without her. She returned Oliver's ring to him again. Oliver told her that he didn't want to let her go but she told him that she was already gone.

But over time, Oliver began to understand that it was mainly his own fault Felicity was willing to go to extreme lengths to see Diaz dead, all the while claiming it's for the protection of her family.

   One night, when she and Oliver were about to have dinner, they heard someone inside the house. Oliver grabbed a knife to confront the culprit, who turned out to be Mar Novu, the Monitor. Because of the deal Oliver had made with him, he had now come to get Oliver to help him prepare the world for the Crisis, that is coming. Felicity could hardly believe her ears, and finally came to see, that she and Oliver could never have a normal life, and was even more shocked, when Mar Novu told that Oliver is destined to die in the Crisis. He apologized to Felicity for not being able to prevent Oliver's death, but claimed that he can save countless others. Oliver says a hearty farewell to Felicity and Mia, with Felicity crying like never before, as she had to let go of the man she loved more than anything, and could do nothing to stop him, as the fate of the entire multiverse was at stake.

     Felicity is an intelligent, ambitious, hard-working and tech-savvy individual who is extremely confident in her computer skills. Although she doesn't go looking for trouble, Felicity is also not one to back away from danger, particularly when there is a mystery waiting to be solved; for example, she accepted the task of investigating

     's warning that the last
     man

     Aside from Felicity's natural talents and developed skills, her most prominent attributes are her capacity for compassion, kindness and trust; it is these traits which allowed Oliver to trust her with the knowledge of his vigilante activities, as well as rely only on her promise that she would deliver him to his father's old factory after being shot, despite the risk of her alerting the authorities instead.

True to her tech-savvy nature, Felicity upgraded the Arrowcave's computers simply because Oliver's poorly set up system bugged her. She also helped him cover his tracks by hacking into the SCPD crime lab's computers and to order the destruction of Oliver's blood sample, which was collected by the police after he was shot by his mother.

This ultimately backfires as Felicity revealed this truth to Oliver. Her stance was largely fueled by the knowledge that just as Moira's relationship with the children had been destroyed; due to her lies and manipulation, so to, she did not want to become like Moira.

     Felicity's trademark babbling often results in her feeling embarrassed, so she tries to backtrack and explain herself, which only contributes to her rambling, the exception to her embarrassment seems to be Barry, though neither of them seem to notice when she does it, in spite of her tendency to babble, Felicity isn't afraid to give voice to her opinions, and she always stands her ground unwavering when confident she's in the right; she was even willing to stand up to strong authority figures and leaders for what she believed was right, such as "

Despite their numerous disagreements working together, they came to love each other very much; even when Felicity was dating Ray, deep down she was still in love with him the whole time, even if she was not fully aware of it;

     Felicity did not like being kept in the dark from secrets and decisions she felt entitled to know about/be involved in, especially where Oliver was concerned as she strongly feels sharing is important in a healthy relationship. When Felicity found out that Oliver didn't tell her about her son, she became very angry with him and was in disbelief that he hid something that big from her; in reality, Oliver desperately wanted to tell her but promised his
     child's mother
     he wouldn't tell anyone about his existence, even Felicity, an explanation she didn't accept as she felt this suggested Oliver wasn't capable of leaning on her to help when things got complicated.

This took a toll on her, causing Felicity to develop a more hardened personality and survival instincts, obsessing (in Oliver's eyes) over security systems and losing any qualms she might've once had over owning and using a gun. Felicity honestly believed her former self was weak and, when called out on her actions by Oliver, stated that she had only done what she had to do after her husband left them defenseless in his absence. In spite of what she had been through however, much of her bright, optimistic, and kindhearted personality persisted, with her and Oliver still bringing out the best in each other.
