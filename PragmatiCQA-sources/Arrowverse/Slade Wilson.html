   Billy Wintergreen

   Slade also married a woman named
   Adeline Kane

   Slade always kept secret about his real job from his son, telling him he was a pilot for an Australian airline.

   At some point during Joe's childhood, Adeline gave birth to a second son,

When Joe made a remark that they wouldn't stay long because of Slade's job, he assured his son that while he worked for the Australian airlines, the weekend was about them. After Joe left to prepare the tent, Slade took out his gear and prepared for his mission.

   That night, he cooked some fish, despite Joe claiming to not like fish. Joe then questioned his father's status as a pilot, talking about how his friend Nick gets free trips because his father is a pilot for
   Ferris Air
   while they don't. Before Slade could respond, he spotted his target and made eye contact with him. He then returned to his conversation with Joe and told him that he worked for a cheaper airline that didn't allow free trips. Not buying it, Joe decided he wasn't hungry and went for a walk. Once Joe was gone, Slade made contact with the ASIS that he had eyes on his target.

While he continued eating it Slade spotted Ming walking by Slade claimed he had to use the bathroom, while he was really going to find Ming.

Slade was held a prisoner in Fyers' camp for almost a year until Yao Fei managed to free him. The two took refuge in the
   wreck of Slade's plane
   . They planned to escape the island by stealing a supply plane that made regular stops on the island's airstrip, but before they could do so, the two were separated.

   , who had been shipwrecked on Lian Yu, searching through his hideout. When Slade threatened cut out his voice box unless he revealed who he was. Oliver explained that Yao Fei had sent him, which caused Slade to loosen his grip on the shipwrecked billionaire. Oliver showed Slade the message Yao Fei gave him and deduced that he sent Oliver to him to help him take the airstrip. He threw Oliver a few swords and tested him on his weapon skills. He found Oliver to be an unskilled fighter. Oliver claimed he wasn't a fighter, accidentally killing a man and taking his uniform. When Slade demanded to know where Yao Fei was during it, Oliver told him he ran after he got captured.

  <p key="0ee710f9-2001-4655-99d4-a21fcafcc366">
   Viewing him as a liability, Slade attacked Oliver and knocked him unconscious. He bound Oliver to a chair by his wrists. When Oliver woke up, Slade explained to him that he had to kill him. When Oliver begged him to spare his life, Slade refused and assured him he'll kill him in a way that he wouldn't feel a thing. Just before he could, Oliver freed himself by dislocating his thumb. He went on to punch Slade in the face, convincing Slade that he was worth keeping alive and then officially introduced himself.

  <p key="54d56d69-f7dd-4fda-b5e0-89f55c1d518f">
   That night, while Oliver was recovering, Slade told him that what he did earlier didn't change anything between them. He explained that if he compromised his chances of getting off Lian Yu, he would kill him. He then ordered Oliver to choose a weapon to begin training. While choosing a weapon, Oliver found Slade's mask that was identical to that of Wintergreen, who had tortured Oliver at Fyers' camp when he first arrived on the island. Not realizing it was another mask, Oliver accused Slade of deceiving him, but Slade explained both he and his ex-partner wore the mask to protect their identities, as well as their allegiance to ASIS and their mission.

  <p key="f4ff3269-48ff-44c2-be30-8570fd91ed71">
   Slade attempted to train Oliver to fight, to not much success until he gave the younger man the option to escape or die. They had only ten days to train before the plane arrived on the island. On the tenth day, they started their journey towards Fyers' camp. On the way, Oliver stepped on a land mine, presumably left behind from World War II. When some of Fyers' men approached their position, Slade killed them and used one of their bodies to free Oliver. That night, Slade revealed to Oliver that Wintergreen had betrayed him immediately after their capture and that he was the godfather of Slade's son. Once they reached Fyers' camp, Slade proceeded to take out the soldiers with his sniper rifle, as Oliver reached the communications tower, with his only duty being to kill the man there. Oliver failed in his task, but Slade managed to get there in time to kill the man right before he shot Oliver. Slade told Oliver he would call in an airstrike to blow up the island after they left. Concerned about Yao Fei, Oliver left to bring the other man back with him. Slade stayed behind and told him he had three hours or he would be left behind. Despite what he said, Slade went back for Oliver and saved him from Wintergreen. He managed to kill Wintergreen, but was shot in the arm by Fyers. Slade acknowledged Oliver had proved himself to be a fighter.
   Shortly afterward, Slade's bullet wound became infected, forcing Oliver to head out to find Yao Fei's
   herbs
   , which could fight the infection. Oliver came back with the herbs and claimed not to have encountered any problems.

   When Oliver attempted to fix the damaged radio they had obtained from the communications tower, Slade joked "pigs would fly" before he succeeded. Ironically, Oliver managed to repair the radio, shocking Slade. However, they discovered the radio could only receive, but not transmit, so they could not use it to call for rescue. As Slade listened to the soldiers' frequency, he overheard Fyers talking about something called Scylla to an unknown man. Oliver explained Scylla was a monster in the
   <i key="ab04cea2-407f-457f-85ea-3de5d389f9b0">

   by Homer. The two men left to discover what Scylla was and found it was a missile launcher.

  <p key="50011c54-762d-4f0e-b9eb-a2cafb84978a">
   To get closer to the missile launcher, Slade pretended to be a prisoner taken by Oliver. The ploy worked, and Slade managed to kill all the guards around the missile launcher. Just as he was about to destroy it, Oliver stopped him and took out the circuit board instead, effectively stopping the missile launcher from working. Slade was excited to have leverage over Fyers. Oliver contacted Fyers and arranged to trade the circuit board back to him in return for a way off the island.
   At the meeting, Fyers questioned if he could trust them to be truthful. Slade answered he himself would not, but Oliver had a thing for principles. Fyers took advantage of that and brought out

   , Yao Fei Gulong's daughter. When Fyers threatened to kill Shado, Slade attacked him, providing enough distraction so he and Oliver, along with Yao Fei and Shado, could escape. On the way, Yao Fei was shot, and he told the others to leave him behind. When they returned to their hideout, they discovered that the circuit board was missing. Slade was angry at Oliver for being played, until Shado pointed out that Fyers could not risk them leaving the island with their knowledge anyway.
  </p>
  <p key="dd0cdc92-65a5-4b50-b2de-d6e36999dafd">
   Slade started sparring with Shado, with the two proving to be equally matched. When Shado asked how well a fighter Oliver was, Slade answered he had tried to train Oliver with limited success. Shado decided to train Oliver herself, and Slade left them to it. When he returned later, Slade found Oliver slapping a bowl of water and found out he had been doing it all day. Shado claimed the exercise built strength, and was proven correct when Oliver managed to draw the bow in their possession, impressing Slade with the technique. Later, Slade discussed how to rescue Yao Fei with Shado and came to the conclusion they would need someone else to watch their back. Slade refused Shado's proposal to have Oliver do it with the bow, saying he was not ready. Shado took Oliver away to train, and told Slade if he was not ready by the end of the day, they would try a new plan.
   When they returned, Slade found out Oliver had failed at hunting down an animal. Before they could formulate a new plan, however, Yao Fei arrived with Fyers' soldiers to surround them. Angry at Yao Fei's betrayal, Slade attacked Yao Fei but was knocked down by one of the soldiers.

   Fyers took the three back to his camp. When he wanted to make a point to Yao Fei, he shot Slade in the leg. Slade witnessed Yao Fei's death when Fyers had no more use for him and shot him in the head.
   Slade, Oliver and Shado managed to break their bonds and attacked Fyers and his men. Slade survived the blast from the missile launcher and joked Oliver could not save the day without making a mess. Fyers arrived with Shado, revealing he had survived the blast, and angry at Oliver for ruining his two-year operation. Oliver killed Fyers using Yao Fei's bow, impressing Slade that he could kill.

   5 months later, Slade continued to train Oliver. While sparring, Oliver got distracted and he hit him, saying, "You're not the first one to learn the hard way women are a distraction". A few minutes later, a proximity detector device they had salvaged from the wreckage of Fyers' camp went off, and they went looking for the people the device had detected, but Shado was quickly captured, so Oliver and Slade chased after her. Later, Slade and Oliver caught up with Shado and the people who captured her. Slade tried to stop Oliver from doing anything rash, but the leader hit Shado, and Oliver became enraged and attacked the leader while Slade attacked the others. Slade and Shado were shocked when Oliver was unable to control himself and kill the leader. Moments later, Slade picked up a radio that went off, and the three were left wondering how many more men are on the island and where they came from.

  <p key="7deb0d76-ada0-46f2-b22b-e33f56a7205f">
   Slade talks to Shado and, knowing what he's going through, asks her to comfort Oliver. He finds a map, similar to the one provided to him by ASIS. Later, Slade sees Oliver and Shado by the river, becoming closer. He reminds Oliver that women can be a distraction, and that that can get him killed, as they leave the riverside. They go to the location in the picture, and Oliver soon after directs him and Shado to a cave. There he discovers a blade, in which he says is 60 years-old, and they also discover the remains of World War II Japanese soldiers.
   Slade has Oliver tag along with him to scout for the new threat to the island, telling him that Shado can take care of herself as they leave. As they are going up to higher ground, Slade once again reminds Oliver that woman can be a distraction, while in conversation Slade almost falls off the cliff side if not for Oliver catching him in time. Slade and Oliver make it to the top of the cliff and spy the ship firing at a fixed location where they work out is where the plane is which causes Oliver to run with Slade giving chase. Slade is chasing Oliver while the area is still under fire. Slade is last seen being hit by an explosion, with his hands and the right side of his face on fire, yelling in pain.

   Slade survived the attack and is seeking refuge on the island. The explosion has left severe burns on one side of his face, however, as Shado tends to his wounds. Despite his warning to leave him for safety, Shado declares that she is here to stay, and would never leave anyone she cared for alone.
   Slade is still weak and under extreme pain, with a herbal ointment covering the right side of his face. When

   The group find the submarine and the Mirkauru on-board but can't find a sedative to give Slade first. Oliver gives Slade a choice as the injection without a sedative could kill him but Slade agrees but before Oliver gives it to him he confesses his romantic feelings for Shado. Oliver then injects the Mirakuru into him. The injection causes blood to come out of his eyes, and then he collapses into unconsciousness though the others believe him to be dead.
   When Ivo catches up with the group he checks Slade's pulse and, finding no pulse, leaves Slade for dead. But Slade awakens a few minutes after his injection with Mirakuru, calling Shado's name. He runs to the site where Ivo had killed Shado, and thanks to his Mirakuru-enhanced physical capabilities, he easily slaughters Ivo's men. He then picks up Shado's body and vows that the person responsible for her death will suffer.

Later Slade wants to get geared up to kill Ivo and his men but Sara tells him that he can't handle it by himself but this enrages Slade as Sara was working for Ivo but when Oliver tries to break them up, Slade starts chocking Oliver to death until Sara uses a tree branch to stop him before he tells him that the Mirakuru is affecting his mind. Later without Sara or Oliver, Slade takes the Mirakuru serums and heads after Ivo himself.
   Slade uses Fyers’ missile launcher and intended to open fire on the freighter until he was confronted by Oliver and Sara who threatened to kill Oliver but he managed to make him see reason using Shado and Joe. He then sat down and questioned what was happening to him, Oliver promised him that he wasn't going to give up on his friend and soon proclaimed they were going to take the freighter from Ivo.
   Slade, Oliver and Sara are observing Ivo's ship from a cliphead until they hear a plane flying overhead. The three try to get it's attention but it is shot down, the pilot dying. Slade and Oliver rush back to the plane to get medical supplies but arrive too late. They do however find a parachute in the pilot's plane.

   Slade observes Oliver's training and is impressed. Slade agrees that they should burn the last remaining Mirakuru prior to their attack on the freighter. Before attacking the ship Slade notes the first time they attempted to escape was as strangers but now was as brothers. As they reach the freighter, Slade tells Oliver and Sara not to kill Ivo as he wants Ivo for himself. Slade learns the truth about Shado after listening in to Oliver and Ivo's conversation. An enraged Slade attacks Oliver violently but Oliver slips away from him as explosions occur on the freighter. As Oliver attempts to escape the freighter, Slade grabs Oliver by the leg and imprisons him. When the Butcher, the ship's captain orders him to enter the cell with Oliver, he refuses. He crushes the skull of the Butcher who attempts to shoot him and declares himself the new captain. Later, he would ask Ivo to show him how he killed Shado and then lacerates Ivo's hand. Slade then promises to Oliver he will make him suffer in the same way he suffered before killing him.

   Slade returns Oliver and Ivo both to the island in exchange for Hendrick, who has been secretly rigged with explosives, but as his men take him outside Slade senses the explosives due to Mirakuru and removes and disables them. He then wants to kill Sara and Oliver but has a hallucination about Shado who tells him to leave them on the island forever. As Slade walks outside he tells Oliver that once the ship is ready, he is going after his family.
   Later Slade had his men take Sara on the island

Before he can kill Oliver however some rubble falls from the ceiling and traps Slade. Oliver has the choice to either kill Slade or cure him.

After learning Thea's location from Isabel, Arrow storms the building, taking down many armed henchmen. However Deathstroke knowing what Oliver would do is already across town to fulfill the next stage of his plan.

   Deathstroke stops the prisoner bus transfer in progress and kills the guards and releases the prisoners, then Deathstroke informs them that he has a proposal for them all. Slade later meets with Sebastian and Isabel in Oliver's office where Sebastian is frustrated that Moira is getting the voters support, but Slade angrily tells him that he is holding up his end. When Isabel reveals that Queen Consolidated's applied sciences is ready to replicate Mirakuru, Slade decides it's time to expose one more secret of Oliver's, again seeing a hallucination of Shado. He later turns up at Laurel's apartment and tells her that Oliver is the Arrow.

   To ensure Sebastian became mayor and to traumatize Oliver, Slade used a truck to crash the Queens limo. While they were unconscious he tied Oliver up and held Moira and Thea at gun point in a scenario identical to Ivo holding Sara and Shado at gun point and also tells Oliver to choose. Slade also mentions that he knows exactly how the scenario went down, claiming that Shado told him point to her but Oliver only sees the woods and realizes Slade is seeing hallucinations. Slade also exposed to Moira and Thea that he was on the island with Oliver and Oliver's relationship with Shado, but before he could force Oliver to choose Moira stood up and begged Slade to kill her instead. Slade aimed the gun but lowered it, admiring Moira's courage but expressing sorrow that she didn't pass it onto Oliver before impaling her with his sword. As Slade walked off, he tells Oliver that he will kill one more person before he kills Oliver, then leaves him and Thea to grieve.

After learning that, Slade escaped. Slade quickly attacked and knocked them both out and placed them in the Supermax. Slade said he would leave them on the island like Oliver did to him and telling him to be grateful that he didn't bury Thea next to Shado, then taunting Oliver about Shado's death again and stating that had he told him the truth himself Moira may still be alive.

However, Oliver managed to convince her not to kill Slade, but she still shot him in the shoulder. Returning to the Supermax, Slade noted that Thea was not the killer Oliver was. As Oliver was leaving Slade taunted him about the people he had lost and how losing any more would leave nothing of Oliver Queen.

Harkness implored to his old friend to make the sensible choice and join him on the winning side, and Slade seemingly accepted, telling Evelyn to put her gun to Oliver's head, but as Harkness expressed gratitude at Slade being smart in his decision, Slade berated Digger for simply assuming that he was on the winning side and suddenly assaulted his former friend. Oliver quickly disarmed Sharp and Talia was forced to escape with Harkness as Malcolm Merlyn and Nyssa al Ghul arrived on Oliver's side. As Slade forced Sharp into a cage, he coldly advised Sharp to pick better friends since they left her behind, but she remained defiant, stating it might as well be part of the plan. After Malcolm led Oliver's friends to the plane to escape, Nyssa, Oliver and Slade went to track down Talia's trail to the hideout. As Nyssa went ahead to recover the lost trail, an amused Slade mentions how Oliver married Ra's al Ghul's daughter Nyssa instead of Felicity, and helped Oliver to come to terms with his father's suicide. Slade told Oliver he needed to forgive himself and not blame himself for his father's death, advice that Oliver later accepts to make peace with his past sins.

Slade then fought alongside Team Arrow and Nyssa in defeating the acolytes with Adrian Chase, and witnessed Oliver besting Chase, but was visibly shaken when Chase claimed to have murdered Oliver's son William. He took his mask off and stepped towards Oliver with sympathy, only for Oliver to express disbelief at the claim. Oliver had Slade accompany his friends in getting off the island. When Team Arrow learned the plane they wanted to use was sabotaged, Slade said that they would not leave without Oliver and William, even though Oliver asked him over comms to escort the others to an A.R.G.U.S. supply ship. When Adrian Chase killed himself to detonate the explosives covering the island,
   Slade and Team Arrow had managed to survive, although Slade survived due to his durable armor rather than the plane. He and Team Arrow then split up to look for survivors, where he came across a comatose Thea. He then bumped into Oliver and took him to Thea.

Upon realizing Oliver was hopeless in helping him take down Edward Fyers, he decided to perform a coup de grace on Oliver to spare him any suffering from facing Edward, but also to prevent his location from being given up. However, upon realizing being on the brink of death began to awaken the warrior inside Oliver, Slade changed his mind about killing Oliver and decided to train him. Slade's isolation on Lian Yu and Wintergreen's betrayal has turned him into a little bit of a cynic, admitting to Oliver that he was disgusted how Billy could have betrayed him despite being the godfather of his son even believing that "everyone in this world is out for themselves". Slade's cynicism was also shown in his sense of humor, normally being tough, sarcastic and a little bit deadpan towards Oliver and his incompetence, however, he was also capable of being impressed as a mentor would be. He soon began seeing Oliver more of a brother than a friend.

     , which combined with his grief over the loss of Shado makes him impulsive, reckless, aggressive, violent, and bent on revenge against Ivo. Once he discovers Oliver's shared role in Shado's death he becomes completely hell bent on revenge against him which would stay for years after, tarnishing the brotherly bond they once had and making them bitter enemies.

     In the present day Slade's anger and hatred has increased more to the point of full vendetta against Oliver upon learning of his survival on the island. Slade is intelligent, calculating, and patient; he waited 5 years to get/plan his revenge against Oliver. He is also arrogant, overconfident and boastful of his Mirakuru powers, as has no fear of Oliver because of them; these traits are well deserved as bullets do no harm to him and even getting cut to the bone doesn't affect him as it all heals back, though explosives and poisons can still harm him but only for a brief time.

     for his failures, eventually having him killed for betraying him. Due to the Mirakuru, Slade's sense of honor has become twisted, and when it comes to Oliver, he is cruel, sadistic and ruthless. He displays little emotion when killing innocent people. He also has developed a complete disregard for human life and watched in amusement as his army tore Starling City apart, his only regret being that Shado couldn't be there. He also holds little regard for his own allies as he cared little for his own men being cured, however Slade seems to be close to Isabel as he seemed desperate to have her revived by the Mirakuru. However Slade was still willing to abandon her to Oliver during the attack and it's unknown if he is aware of Isabel's death at Nyssa's hands or how he feels about it. Slade also suffers from hallucinations of Shado which have lasted from the past to present.
    </p>
    Even when cured from the Mirakuru, the physiological effects have still remained as Slade still vows to kill Oliver even when confined and defeated. Even a whole year later this vendetta still stayed when Oliver and Thea were trapped on the island with him. Though he had become less hostile and wasn't even phased by being imprisoned again and even gave advice to keep Thea away from Malcolm, but reminds him that he will break if he loses more people, hinting that he has regained some respect for his former protegé and friend. When Thea had him at gunpoint, Slade tried to goad Thea into killing him; knowing that this would cause permanent emotional damage that would send her into the same darkness that he and Oliver had experienced.

Slade even helps save Oliver's friends and family, including

     High-level intellect/Master tactician/leader:
    </b>
    Slade is extremely intelligent and a near flawless tactician, as he is able to create extremely efficient plans for combat, infiltration, and destruction even at a great disadvantage or with few resources. He is also able to expertly incorporate his strategical prowess into his fighting style, skillfully developing specific plans of attack by using the environment or distractions to his advantage. Slade with the help of Oliver quickly formulated a plan to take over an airfield crowded with troops, and later managed to destroy much of
    Edward Fyers' compound
    alone, using only improvised explosives and distraction. Later, Slade was also shown to be well-versed in mathematics, doing various mathematical calculations to program a missile launcher to directly hit the ship Ivo and his crew were on. He was able to calculate the flight with a parachute to land on the freighter. After the island getaway, Slade, in his personal vendetta against Oliver, was capable of tactically outsmarting the also highly skilled tactician Oliver Queen for the majority of their conflict until he was eventually outsmarted and trapped by Oliver presenting Felicity as the woman he loved, allowing Oliver to cure and defeat him, but nevertheless making him one of the very few to ever outsmart Oliver. He devised an extremely complex plan that could keep his enemies, like Team Arrow and Oliver overwhelmed, as well as to infiltrate the government of
