   . He spent much of his life in Newark, New Jersey. Daniel attended a Summer camp at the insistence of his mother and made three friends. One of which was a girl named Judy, who was his first girlfriend. He also was a member of the Newark YMCA, where he took a beginners course in karate.

   However, when Daniel was eight years old, his father died of a terminal illness. Daniel later expressed that his strongest memory of his childhood was saying goodbye to Mr. LaRusso and being proud that he could be there for his father in the last minutes of his life. As years passed and Daniel matured into a teenager, his mother Lucille worked hard as a widow. She worked two jobs to support her son.

   Daniel seemed to enjoy his early life in New Jersey. When he moved away from Newark and took a last look at the neighborhood he grew up in, multiple friends from the neighborhood and their parents were there to wish Daniel and his mother best of luck in their new home.

Freddy reluctantly abandons Daniel on the beach after being asked by his friends why he brought a loser like him to the party.

   and would first run into Freddy and his friends, many of whom mock Daniel for how he lost to Johnny the way he did.  He also runs into Ali again, whom flirts with him as well as showing him her soccer moves, which are considerable.  Daniel would get into the try out line for the school's soccer team, but is spotted by Johnny and his Cobra Kai allies, whom all collude to do embarrass Daniel during his try out.  When the try out begins,

But before Bobby and the Cobra Kai's can retaliate, the soccer coach intercedes, and kicks Daniel off the team for striking a teammate.
  </p>
  <p key="5b954d1c-40cc-4fb2-910f-930a5cd879ee">
   Daniel would also begin exploring his relationship with Ali at school, with time spent in the school cooridor as well as lunch together at school and other activities.  But the always present spectre of Johnny and the Cobra Kais hang over Daniel, prompting Daniel to often evade events or things if Johnny and his allies are around.
  </p>
  <p key="3397b0d9-8395-4b2d-a8c9-0efdfb63967c">
   In the following weeks, Daniel occasionally falls under the ire of Johnny and the rest of the Cobra Kai gang, who harass him. Daniel believes his karate lessons from the Newark YMCA are insufficient to defend himself from the likes of Johnny, and checks out the Cobra Kai dojo. In doing so, he sees the star pupil is none other than Johnny, who is Kreese's assistant instructor. While going to the head of the class to teach the white belts, Johnny smirks at Daniel. Daniel departs Cobra Kai and goes to a restaurant across the street to meet his mother, who is glad Daniel disapproved of the dojo as she remarks she would have probably been unable to afford its tuition. Lucille also tells Daniel some good news, she got promoted in her job, but her managerial training program will likely mean nights away from home.   While riding his bike home, Johnny and the Cobra Kai's ambush Daniel, and force him off an embankment that seriously injures Daniel.   Daniel, in a rage, would trash his bike, and confront his mother about coming out the California in the first place.
  </p>
  <p key="ebf76ee5-f408-4ff8-80fb-d2e2012719c6">
   In the aftermath of this, Mr Miyagi would overhear this, and would recover Daniels bike from the trash bin and repair it for Daniel.   It was in the aftermath of this, that Daniel would first get to speak to Mr Miyagi on a personal level and would be introduced to the world of miniature bonsai trees.  The two would begin a lifelong bond over this, as Daniel would spend a lot of time after school with Mr Miyagi learning how to tend bonsai trees.

  <p key="b4131a93-7769-4c97-9d31-aabdd119c6b3">
   Throughout the film, Daniel alludes to being influenced by a “little voice in [his] head.” He first mentions it to Ali, but later on he appears to be having a lively conversation with the voice for roughly five minutes after his mother leaves him alone at the table. One theory popularized by fans of the film speculates that the “little voice” he speaks to belongs to none other than Johnny, who appears to be able to not only communicate with him inside his head but also see through his eyes, as evidenced by the fact that in the Cobra Kai pilot, Johnny is able to see a perspective of Ali in flashbacks that only Daniel has ever seen (while they were on a date in Karate Kid I).

  <p key="c40d00be-e4b0-4a8d-bd42-01a63c484d02">
   This conflict finally comes to a head at their high school Halloween party.  Daniel, wearing the costume of a shower stall, is found by Ali, and the two of them share a dance in the reclusivity of Daniel's costume.  Ali shares with Daniel the issues of Johnny and his agression.  Later, Daniel has to head to the bathroom to clean off the residue that a gimmick chicken egg did to him.  While in the bathroom, he discovers that  Johnny is in one of the toliet stalls.  Seeing a chance to get back at Johnny, Daniel places a hose over Johnny as he is rolling a joint, and turn it on,  completely drenching Johnny.  Daniel tries to escape, but hotly pursued by Johnny and the Cobra Kais, whom chase Daniel down from school, down the streets and all the way back to an empty lot near his apartment complex.  The Cobra Kai's  are finally able to catch up with him, and begin beating Daniel (with the exception of

   [one of the more moral and less-corrupted students in Cobra Kai], who tells his friends to leave Daniel alone and that the latter has had enough, only to get rebuked by his friends). Viewing the attack, Mr. Miyagi intervenes. He jumps down from the fence, and beats all of Daniel's assailants single-handedly. When Mr. Miyagi dressed Daniel's wounds, he tried to get to the bottom of why he was assaulted. Mr. Miyagi surmised that their problem was a bad attitude, and it stemmed from their sensei, as Miyagi believed there is no such thing as a bad student, only a bad teacher. When Daniel suggested talking over the problem with their sensei, Mr. Miyagi was reluctant to get involved, but did so after he realized Daniel was trying to solve a problem with his head instead of his fists.

  <p key="d3b51dcf-2151-4b93-b6be-1941f06f8432">
   Daniel and Mr. Miyagi go to the Cobra Kai Dojo the next day to attempt to make peace, and ask the sensei,

   </a>
   to order his students to stop. Kreese teases Daniel that he should fight his own battles, to which Miyagi says maybe so for one bully, but five bullies ganging up on Daniel like last night was too much to ask of anyone. Kreese agrees to even out the odds 1-1 and arranges a fight on the spot, but Miyagi says there is enough fighting. Miyagi finally agrees to settle the issue mano-a-mano through the forthcoming All-Valley Karate Tournament, to which Kreese agrees, as well as order all the Cobras not to harass Daniel until then so he can train.
  </p>
  <p key="fc279d13-66e8-4712-895e-de125c1eb261">
   Mr. Miyagi begins to teach Daniel the ways of karate through a series of labor tasks, including paint the fence, paint the house, wax the car, and sand the floor.  It is thru out this training that Daniel beings to learn the aspects of Miyagi-Do Karate, and after a few trials, begins to really absorb the lessons that Mr Miyagi is teaching him.
  </p>
  <p key="62f892c6-73a5-4225-a17d-d9cdc202e1ba">
   Daniel would also continue his relationship with Ali during this time.  They would go on their first date together to

   to pick Ali up from there.  Daniel would sneak into the country club when Ali was running late (she was being held up by her parents, and also Johnny, whom claimed to offer a truce).  While dancing together, Johnny spied Daniel watching them and took the opportunity to kiss Ali.  This prompts Daniel to turn and run but runs into a waiter and both of them are sprawled on the ground covered in spaghetti.  Daniel would turn and run from the country club, and missed seeing Ali deck Johnny for all this.

   .  He would also give Daniel a Gi for the tournament with the Miyagi family crest on the back.   Daniel would go to back to GolfNStuff, to celebrate and would try to make amends with Ali.  He was still of the belief that Ali was not interested in him for not being of means, but is corrected by Ali's best friend

   . Bobby is told by Kreese to put Daniel out of commission, and despite Bobby's protests about being disqualified and believing he could beat Daniel, he still follows Kreese's orders. Bobby savagely hurts Daniel with an illegal kick to the knee. The tournament is suspended where Daniel will be allowed fifteen minutes to be examined by a doctor, and if Daniel cannot fight, Johnny will win by forfeit. In the infirmary, the doctor thinks Daniel should sit it out, but disappointedly says how well Daniel did out there. Ali is saddened that the Cobras will win and get to jeer Daniel, and Miyagi thinks Daniel should follow the doctor's recommendation, as there is nothing to prove and he did his best up until now. Daniel recalls Miyagi did a pain suppression massage when he had been sore in training, which healed Daniel's arm. Mr. Miyagi agrees to try the massage. Meanwhile, the ring announcer is about to award the championship to Johnny, only to be told by Ali that Daniel will fight. As Daniel hobbles to the ring, the ring announcer surprisingly speaks into his microphone "Daniel LaRusso is going to fight?" as the crowd bursts into applause. The ring announcer then happily says he is glad the finals are on, as that is what the audience came to see.

   Daniel starts strong, winning the first two points. However, when Johnny sweeps Daniel's leg and fights more aggressively and underhandedly, as per Kreese's orders, Daniel loses the next two points. Johnny grabs one of Daniel's kicks from his injured leg, and elbows it, causing Daniel an insane amount of pain. Daniel is no longer able to stand on that leg, so he assumes the crane technique position as his final stance, and when the ref signals the next bout, Johnny moves forward, only for Daniel to kick Johnny in the face, winning the tournament. Daniel is then rushed by his friends and family, and Johnny grabs the trophy from the organizer of the tournament, and presents it to Daniel, saying, "You're all right LaRusso! Good match!" The movie then closes with Daniel looking towards Mr. Miyagi,who was sitting on the bleachers, and sees him smiling proudly.

   Immediately after the tournament, Daniel is showering and changing into street clothes. He is remarking what his athletic future holds, to which Mr. Miyagi dryly remarks "Early retirement". As Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are leaving the All-Valley Tournament, they overhear John Kreese berating Johnny for losing. Kreese then starts to mercilessly strangle Johnny, despite the pleas of the rest of the Cobra Kai. Mr. Miyagi intervenes, and after tricking Kreese into punching two car windows and making both of his hands bleed, Miyagi pulls him down and appears to be preparing a killing blow. However, he only honks Kreese's nose, causing Kreese to faint in embarrassment. Daniel, astonished by all this, remarks how Miyagi could have killed Kreese, but Miyagi philosophically responds that for a man like Kreese, who has no concept of forgiveness, "living is a worse punishment than death". As Johnny and the Cobras dispose of their Cobra Kai gis and leave in disgust, Mr. Miyagi tells Daniel there has been enough fighting for one night and that they should go meet Mrs. LaRusso and Ali at a restaurant for a celebration dinner.

   Six months later, Daniel angrily comes to Mr. Miyagi's house with his car, steamily stating that Ali did something to the car. He also tells him that Ali has fallen in love with a football player as well. To make matters worse, he is supposed to go away on a long trip with his mom. But Mr. Miyagi calls his mom, and convinces her to let Daniel stay with him. Miyagi then gets a letter from Tomi Village saying that his father is dying, so he makes emergency plans to travel to

At the airport, he is met by Daniel, who figured he must have come there to say goodbye. However, he sees Daniel with a ticket on the same flight as him. He wonders where Daniel got the money, to which Daniel says he emptied his savings account intended for college. Mr. Miyagi does not think it is a good idea for Daniel to tag along, but as the flight is about to depart he approves of taking Daniel with him to Japan.

Chozen makes life difficult for them when he goes to their house and starts screaming in the night for Miyagi to come out, and destroying the thin walls with a spear. Miyagi's father dies, and Sato gives Miyagi three days to grieve before they must fight.

Chozen then challenges him to do better, and while Daniel is trying to leave, Miyagi comes in, and places 600 dollars on Daniel breaking all of the ice blocks. Chozen says he cannot cover that, and that is when Sato comes in and says that Chozen is covered. Daniel succeeds, and this further angers Chozen, who later goes up and robs Daniel to get his money back.

   Things come to a head, when a huge storm comes, destroying much of Okinawa. Sato is trapped in a destroyed building, trapped beneath a large piece of wood. Miyagi hears his screams, and runs out from shelter to save his old friend. he breaks the wood, and helps Sato get to shelter. Sato then decides to forgive Miyagi, and disowns his nephew who had done nothing to help people. Chozen then runs into the storm.

   There is a huge celebration that the storm has passed, and Kumiko is dancing in the island in the middle of the castle. Chozen ziplines in screaming, and holds a knife to Kumiko's neck. He then orders Daniel to come into the circle, and then drop the bridge. He wants to fight to the death and Daniel accepts in order to save Kumiko. They begin to fight and Daniel holds his own, striking Chozen as often as he is hit himself. However, Chozen begins to get the upper hand, despite Daniel attempting the crane technique, for which Chozen knows the counter and he turns it against him. When it looks as if Daniel is going to lose, Miyagi starts twirling a hand drum. Soon, all of the onlookers are also twirling their hand drums. Miyagi is telling Daniel to use the drum technique, and Daniel finally understands the Miyagi family technique.

   Daniel starts to repeatedly punch Chozen in the face, while twisting his upper body with every hit, so it resembles a swinging drum. He knocks Chozen to the ground, and tells him, "Live or die man!" Chozen responds, "Die. Deciding not to give him what he wants, " Daniel says, "Wrong!" and honks his nose, similar to what Miyagi did to Kreese following the tournament,. The camera then focuses on Miyagi, who is once again smiling proudly at his student, and the movie ends.

   Barnes and his friends return to make Daniel sign up for the tournament; when Daniel again refuses, a skirmish ensues until Miyagi arrives and fends off the three men. After driving Jessica home, Daniel and Miyagi return to find their stock of bonsai trees missing and a tournament application hanging in place. To replace the missing trees, Daniel and Jessica decide to dig up and sell a valuable bonsai tree that Miyagi brought from Okinawa, and planted halfway down a cliff. As they retrieve it, Barnes and his henchmen appear and retract their climbing ropes, leaving Daniel no choice but to sign up for the tournament. After pulling them back up, Barnes breaks the tree. Daniel returns to the shop with Miyagi's damaged bonsai, which Miyagi attempts to mend. Miyagi tells Daniel that he sold his truck to buy a new stock of trees, and cannot train him for the tournament.

   Silver offers to "train" Daniel for the tournament at the Cobra Kai dojo with a series of brutal, violent, offensive techniques. He derides Miyagi's kata forms and pressures Daniel to destroy a wooden practice dummy, causing him several injuries in the process. Throughout his training, Daniel's frustration alienates him from Miyagi. While Daniel and Jessica are at a nightclub, Silver bribes a random man into provoking a fight with Daniel, who responds by punching the man and breaking his nose. Shocked by his aggressive behavior, Daniel apologizes and makes amends with Jessica and Miyagi. Daniel visits Silver to inform him that he will not compete at the tournament, but Silver reveals his true agenda to Daniel as Barnes and Kreese enter the dojo. After Barnes viciously assaults Daniel, Miyagi intervenes and finally agrees to train him. They replant the healed bonsai and begin training.

   At the tournament, Barnes reaches the final round to challenge Daniel. Silver and Kreese instruct Barnes to inflict serious damage on Daniel, keep the score a tie, and finally beat him in the sudden death round. Barnes gets the upper hand during the fight while taunting Daniel relentlessly. When the initial round concludes, Daniel wants to concede, but Miyagi urges him on. In the sudden death round, Daniel performs the kata; as a confused Barnes lunges toward him, Daniel flips him to the ground and strikes him to win the tournament a second year in a row. Silver walks away in disgrace while the crowd throws their Cobra Kai shirts back at him. Daniel runs to Miyagi and proudly embraces him.

   While driving home from work one day, he notices that the Cobra Kai dojo has reopened at a strip mall in Reseda, which revives his rivalry with Johnny Lawrence. Fearing that Johnny will create a new generation of bullies, Daniel becomes focused on trying to close Cobra Kai. This only seeks to inflame tensions, as Johnny has some awareness Daniel wants his dojo closed down, but does not know all the reasons. One night Johnny, whose judgment is clouded by heavy drinking, engages in a sophomoric prank; vandalizing one of the billboards for LaRusso Auto Group by spray-painting a penis next to Daniel's head. This becomes the talk of the town, which makes Daniel the butt of the jokes in online forums and gives rival auto dealer Tom Cole an opportunity to mock the LaRusso Auto Group.

   Soon after, Daniel manipulates Johnny's landlord into doubling the rent on his tenants, attempting to force Johnny to close. However, this fails due to Johnny's student, Miguel, defeating a group of bullies in the school cafeteria, which is then posted to the internet and causes Cobra Kai to become rapidly popular and take in many more students, as well as Daniel's plan falling through when the landlord accuses him of embroiling him in a conspiracy and dissolves their deal. Another factor that saves Johnny from bankruptcy court is Amanda's disgust over Daniel's plan, saying it will also ruin businesses adjacent to Cobra Kai and that this conniving attitude is not like the man she married.

Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of John Kreese and Terry Silver, stating that Kreese himself is dead. When the committee says their sole 1985 entrant was also an instigator who got the ban imposed, Johnny truthfully says he has no allegiance to Mike Barnes. He says that he has learned from his past mistakes and that his dojo is now a place where people who get bullied are taught self confidence and how to stand up for themselves. Despite Daniel's furious objections, the committee is convinced by what seems to be Johnny's genuine sincerity.

   Throughout the years, Daniel is consistently friendly, fairly relaxed, and open-minded. When first arriving in California he easily makes friends before the confrontation with Johnny, though the bullying he endures greatly affects his mental state. He lacks confidence in himself and others, living in a state of fear and panic. He seeks to better protect himself by learning martial arts, where he befriends

    Mr. Miyagi
   </a>
   . Miyagi serves as more than a sensei to Daniel, as Miyagi takes on the role of mentor and serves as a father-figure. Daniel's impatient attitude often caused friction for the pair, as Daniel rushed into things instead of thinking it through. He was quick to anger and lash out at those around him due to his frustration. As he learns how to better himself physically, he couples that with a growing emotional quota. He falls in love for the first time, a relationship that forces him to work through his issues of jealousy and abandonment.
  </p>
  <p key="3f52b136-d212-4918-a3b1-9b882b4b0fce">
   Daniel is frequently heroic. He tries to stand up for those who are considered the underdogs of a situation, such as when he stands up for Ali at the beach, rescues several people during a typhoon and, perhaps zealously, takes it upon himself to protect people from the negative influences of the Cobra Kai Dojo. Matching this heroism is bravery. When necessary, Daniel demonstrates an ability to overcome fear or difficult odds if it means doing what is right or standing up for himself. Equally, he is prone to panicking in the face of threats. His progress is hindered by the mental and emotional assaults he endures at the hands of

   , all of which was orchestrated by Silver. The manipulation was hard for Daniel to overcome and work through, as he placed his trust in the wrong people. However, he eventually finds the resolve to overcome this fear and panic with help from Miyagi and Lucille. He even faces his duel with Chozen, knowing it is to the death, without flinching.
  </p>
  <p key="4c1391a7-df06-4fc0-8c2c-146226784f26">
   Linked to his tendency to panic is his harsh reaction when faced with a resurgent Cobra Kai. Because Daniel was bullied and treated so poorly by members of the Cobra Kai Dojo during his teen years, he associates the name with corrupt individuals, assault, bullying, and manipulation. He was spurred into acting offensively to avoid facing the trauma he endured, and to ensure that his children never had to endure it themselves. As he seeks to destroy the dojo, a much darker side of his personality shows. He manipulates the rent of innocent shop owners and conducts a crusade as he matches Johnny's immaturity and low-blows equally. He is closed to the idea that Johnny or anyone involved in the dojo could change, showing that at least some part of him was trapped in the past instead of moving forward with the life he created. He felt the same way about Chozen, until their reunion. Daniel does realize his mistakes and rededicates himself to his mentor's teachings of balance, harmony, and peace. This method of grounding himself is therapeutic for Daniel and allows him to realign himself with his core personality of being a good person. He even takes in the loner

  <p key="826a76a6-f20e-48dd-8b63-a53057a7a420">
   When Daniel does learn that Robby was manipulating him as a way to anger Johnny, who is Robby's father, Daniel is deeply betrayed and lashes out at Robby verbally. He refuses to associate himself with Robby and bans him from the LaRusso household, despite Robby's attempts to win back his trust and show that, while his initial intentions were negative, he's changed. Daniel has much difficulty with the concept of giving old enemies a second chance, especially when they've proven themselves detestable people many times over. This reluctance to give second chances stems from his betrayal at the hands of Silver and Kreese when Daniel was a teenager.
  </p>

   Daniel's current rivalry and distrust of Johnny and Cobra Kai is not only based on their past disdain, but also his disgust at Johnny's inability to learn a lesson since then and at how much Johnny has wasted his life. Though most of their hostility has been due to misunderstandings and outside sources. This rivalry fuels much of Daniel's choices later in life, but also gives him tunnel vision. Because of his obsession and inability to move past a thirty year rivalry, many avoidable incidents take place. He stops focusing on his business which begins to have financial difficulties, his marriage suffers from his distance, his daughter rebels into a karate brawl, and he loses the trust of many in the valley. When Daniel learns how much he's overlooked he tries to correct his mistakes, though he still falls into old patterns as he makes up for his past actions.

   However, when he learns how far he's drifted from his family, he corrects himself. He shows a protectiveness over them and his unit, begins to communicate more openly with his wife, and attempts to make amends with Sam. When his family is threatened by Kreese and the Cobra Kai's, Daniel is infuriated and the incident leads to a long-awaited fight between him and Kreese. With his family threatened and morality in question, Daniel almost delivers a final blow to Kreese, showing that his heroism and strong moral character can be challenged under the right circumstances. The only thing that stops him is his family.

   Through Miyagi's training Daniel's inherited style is strong in defense and solid in offense, with a notable emphasis on effectively countering his opponent's attacks. These skills assist him during his fights with Johnny and Chozen, the first of which emphasizes his ability to sneak in behind his opponent's guard to strike, whereas in the latter Daniel's karate has become more rounded, due to his experience, allowing to provide effective offense and defense.

   During his teen years, Daniel struggled against opponents that were physically stronger, more skilled, and aggressive and dirty fighters. During his fights with Johnny, Chozen and Mike, Daniel struggled when all three fought more aggressively, and when the former and latter fought underhandedly. Despite struggling when his opponents fight more aggressively or underhandedly, Daniel often has one last tactic in the end which allows him to emerge victorious such as the Crane kick, and the Kata which Miyagi taught him.

   Even after Miyagi's death in 2011 Daniel still remembers Miyagi's lessons and practices what Miyagi taught him, in particular that karate is only used for defense. He later uses his teachings to instruct Johnny's son Robby, in both karate and emotional balance, which leads to him reopening Miyagi-Do Karate. He also uses Miyagi's techniques to defeat Robby's attackers with astonishing ease and efficiency, which clearly demonstrates just how far Daniel has come from his teenage years when he struggled to take on multiple opponents. During this fight, Daniel again displays his style's preference for effective counterattacks; as Daniel notes to Johnny -

   Miyagi was Daniel's mentor and karate sensei, but the mentorship went beyond karate. Daniel learned valuable life lessons and inner-peace from Miyagi, eventually coming to view the man as a father-figure. Miyagi felt the same way, as he had lost his wife and only child during World War II, while Daniel's father had died at a young age. They each filled the gaps left by their tremendous loss. While Daniel loved Miyagi, he was not above snapping at the man or lashing out. He even revolted against Miyagi at one point, believing his teachings were no longer correct. When Daniel saw the error of his ways, Miyagi welcomed Daniel back without judgement. The elder's teachings were often shrouded in mystery that annoyed his young apprentice. When Daniel got married and had a family of his own, he included Miyagi in every possible aspect to the point where Miyagi viewed Daniel's daughter as a granddaughter. Miyagi was also incredibly good-natured to Daniel's mother, Luceille. Unfortunately, Daniel and Miyagi's relationship ended when the latter died. Daniel was left devastated by the loss. He soon discovered that Miyagi had willed him his complete antique car collection and his house which doubled as a dojo. To honor his friend, Daniel began giving away bonsai trees to all his customers that purchased a car from LaRusso Auto Group. Upon reopening Miyagi Do, Daniel strived to be as good of a teacher as Miyagi was. When he felt that he failed, he apologized to a photograph of Miyagi for not doing the right thing.

   Daniel visits Okinawa in an effort to save his business. He visits Miyagi's old village where he revisits many of his memories of his old mentor. Daniel tells Chozen that Miyagi saw him as his son. He discovers that Miyagi hid more dangerous parts of Miyagi-Do from Daniel, presumably to protect him. The visit allows Daniel to learn more about his beloved mentor, reconcile with Chozen, save his business, learn new Miyagi-Do techniques, and later reopen Miyagi Do.
