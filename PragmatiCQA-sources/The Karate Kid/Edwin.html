Just like Edwin, Mikey  stays with Cobra Kai after Daniel tries to persuade students to come to his dojo.

After the soccer game started, Sam tackeled Mikey to the ground and stepped on him. The game proceeds with team Miyagi-Do and team Cobra Kai hurting each other in soccer-style until the coach blows her whistle and tell them all to go to the principal's office Mikey is not present when Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang join their forces in the following morning. It can be assumed that Mikey decided to stay loyal to Cobra Kai even after Hawk left the dojo meaning Edwin and Mikey are still friends.
