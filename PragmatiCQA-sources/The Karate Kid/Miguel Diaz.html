   While in a coma, Miguel is dreaming about fighting and beating an opponent in the All Valley tournament, but eventually he wakes up. His legs, however, aren't functioning. While he is supposed to have surgery, it is unknown whether this will help him to walk again. Initially, Miguel blames Johnny for being in this position, but after some time Johnny starts giving hope to Miguel.

   After Miguel is released from the hospital, Johnny begins performing exercises with him in order to help get his legs functioning. Initially, the exercises aren't working, frustrating Miguel. However, while at a concert, Johnny and Miguel witness Miguel being able to tap his foot, giving everyone some hope. Johnny continues to work with Miguel, sometimes with unorthodox methods, especially in comparison to the physical therapy Miguel also receives. At the same time, Miguel helps Johnny with a Facebook profile.

   While at a restaurant helping Johnny with photos for his Facebook profile, Tory sees Miguel. He expresses that he's upset that Tory did not come to visit him while he was in the hospital. He also does not like when Tory says that Cobra Kai is trying to get back at Miyagi-Do for what happened to him, since he does not see it as Miyagi-Do's fault. At the same time, Tory voices her disappointment for his kiss with Sam. Miguel still does not see this as justifying the fight Tory caused and the brutality with which she fought Sam, and he tells her that she needs help, which angers Tory, as she feels he is calling her crazy. When Miguel ends their relationship, Tory leaves upset and in anger. Later that day while training with Johnny, Miguel lacks motivation, which annoys Johnny, who does not know that Miguel is struggling because he is upset about his breakup with Tory. The two get into an argument, with Miguel accusing Johnny for giving up on his students. After he finishes his ranting, Johnny points out to Miguel that he is standing without assistance, making them both happy and causing them to hug. From then on, Miguel continues to improve with Johnny's training. Miguel goes from a wheelchair to crutches and eventually walking on both feet without the need of any support.

Miguel's and Hawk's friendship ends as a result of Hawk's ruthless actions. Luckily for Miguel, some of his classmates join Johnny's dojo such as Mitch and Bert. They begin training together, but Miguel still struggles with his recovery. He hurts himself while attempting to kick in training, but Johnny tells him that it's alright and that no one expects him to be back to his normal self. After

   In the community hearing about the tournament, Councilperson Roberts is summarizing that the All Valley Tournament should be banned because of the school brawl and the City Council thinking that karate is the problem, but then Miguel shows up. Miguel points out to Roberts that he was involved in the school fight, and that he was the one who was kicked off the second floor balcony and was paralyzed as a result, and he tells the Council that it was Johnny who helped him walk again. He then explains to the Roberts that he was bullied and how karate is a means of teaching kids to defend themselves, and that tournaments are safe places to practice these skills. He also credits Johnny for his success. He is joined by Sam who makes similar arguments. Miguel ends his case by saying that the All Valley should be allowed to be held to give the kids ways of defending themselves. Moved by their pleas, Councilperson Roberts allows the tournament to resume, making both Miguel and Sam happy and hug.

   Back at Miyagi-Do dojo, Miguel and Sam are chatting and celebrating their accomplishment of saving the tournament, and Miguel jokingly gives Sam a hard time about Miyagi-Do. Miguel even teases her into taking him down a second time, reminding of their first date. The two briefly spar, but then stop and stare at each other (romantically). Unfortunately, in that moment Robby walks in on them together, having come to see Sam after his release from juvenile detention center, and he accuses Sam of cheating on him with Miguel. Miguel tries to calm Robby down, tells him it isn't Sam's fault and points out how Robby wasn't there for Sam when she had panic attacks and PTSD from Tory's attack and teh school fight, but Robby angrily tells Miguel to stay out of it. Miguel refuses to do this, and it becomes clear that the rivalry from season one continues. Robby then reignites their rivalry and attempts to punch Miguel, but Sam blocks his punch and pushes Robby away, while telling him to stop. Robby angrily states that they deserve each other and then breaks up with Sam. This leaves Sam devastated and Miguel shocked over nearly being attacked by the same person who put him in the hospital.

   . Miguel then performs a take down, causing both to fall. On the ground, the two kiss, but they are walked-in on by Daniel LaRusso. Although initially tense, the relationship between Daniel and Miguel softens as the two bond over the car Daniel got from Mr. Miyagi. Daniel tells Miguel certain facts about Johnny and his rivalry with Johnny, which Johnny never told Miguel, helping Miguel realize both sides to the rivalry between the two senseis.

However, while being repeatedly hit by Kyler, Miguel remembers the encouragement Johnny gave him while in the coma and his dream about competing in the tournament, as well as imagining Robby as his opponent. Now, regaining his confidence, Miguel defeats and knocks out Kyler, and thanks him for the motivation. After the fight ended, Miguel and Hawk alongside Demetri manages to stop Sam and Tory from fighting before Tory leaves she calls both Miguel and Hawk "traitors". Later on, Miguel returns home bloodied up recovering with ice pack, as Johnny is about to confess his love for Carmen and Johnny gets shocked at Miguel and tells him what happened, after learning the event Johnny fled to Cobra Kai dojo to confront Kreese.

Robby arrives and stands next to Kreese, siding against his old sensei and father in the same move, and shocking Daniel and Johnny.

   film, and the change of character he goes through is significant. Initially, Miguel will only fight for those he cares about, for example defeating Kyler and his gangs after they insult Sam. He goes from being a nice kid who was incessantly bullied to an aggressive karate champion who makes his former tormentors afraid to be around him. More negative tendancies begin when he is convinced that his girlfriend, Samantha, thinks he's not worthy of meeting her family, or was secretly seeing someone else instead (Robby). Miguel proceeds to show more aggression and less sportsmanlike behavior  in the All Valley Tournament. It is suggested that Miguel's transformation from a mild-mannered and pleasant person into a vicious and obsessively competitive individual represents the way that Cobra Kai's "strike first" and "no mercy" rules corrupt innocents and turn them into antisocial bullies.

   Despite becoming indoctrinated into Cobra Kai's "Strike First, Strike Hard, No Mercy" code in the end of season 1 and during the tournament, he being corrected by Johnny seems to calm Miguel down. He's still a nice kid that respects his sensei and stays loyal to his friends. This is also later shown where he initially rebuffs

After discovering that Hawk vandalised the Miyagi-Do dojo and stole Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor, Miguel defeats Hawk in combat, takes the Medal and goes to Sam's house to return it, showing his decency, honor and understaning the value of the Medal, despite his prior actions and Cobra Kai's ruthless mentality. Although initially still interested in getting back together with Sam at the beginning of season 2, Miguel soon meets a new Cobra Kai student named Tory, and the two start dating, and Miguel manages to bring out Tory's softer side.  When he and Sam kiss at Monn's party, he knows it is wrong and still shows his loyalty and connection to Tory by worrying about her whereabouts in the ensuing panic when the arrival of police breaks up the party. At the end of the season, Miguel reveals that he adopted Johnny's adapted code of showing mercy in the fight against Robby during the school brawl, but this does not save him from being badly injured.

   Miguel blames Johnny for being in his situation (hospitalized and not able to walk), and he feels hopeless about ever walking again. However, with Johnny's encouragement and training, Miguel recovers and is able to walk again. After returning to school, he rekindles his friendship with Sam, and shows disappointment in Hawk's latest behavior and actions, completely turning his back on Kreese's old methods for Cobra Kai and embracing Johnny's modified teachings. He soon rekindles his relationship with Sam and becomes a part of Johnny's new dojo, as well as learning to reconcile what Johnny has told him with his new understanding of Daniel LaRusso upon meeting him for the first time. During his fight with Kyler at Sam's house, he is losing most of the time due to him not being back to full form, but after remembering Johnny's encouraging words, he gains his confidence back and defeats Kyler, revealing his determination and strength. The seasons ends with Johnny's and Daniel's dojos merging into one, making Miguel a part of Miyagi-Do.

   When his anger gets the better of him, Miguel fights more aggressively and underhandedly, evidenced during his fights with Robby at the All Valley Tournament and school brawl, though he also knows when to fight a fair fight and show mercy. Miguel has fought underhandedly, evidenced at the All Valley Tournament, where he aggressively attacks Robby's injured shoulder (in a manner not too dissimilar to Johnny Lawrence underhandedly attacking Daniel LaRusso's injured leg in the 1984 All Valley Tournament), and even yanks it in the finals.

   Miguel's biggest weakness is letting his guard down, which allows his opponents to attack him by surprise and beat him. After gaining the upper-hand on Tory in their sparing match, he ends up dropping his guard by offering Tory his hand, who uses this opportunity to flip him over and beat him. After seemingly beating Robby in the school brawl, he drops his guard by letting Robby go. However Robby then viciously attacks Miguel, who is unable to defend himself due to dropping his guard, resulting in Robby unintentionally rendering him unconscious and severely injuring his spine.

   While Miguel defeated Robby in the All Valley tournament in season 1, their match was basically even despite Robby's injured shoulder putting him at a disadvantage. Miguel resorts to attacking the shoulder to win, indicating that he may not have won if he hadn't fought dirty, and that Robby may have won if he had not been injured. Their fight and the result suggests that Miguel was an inferior and less skilled fighter than Robby. In the school brawl in season 2, however, Miguel successfully pins Robby to the ground without fighting dirty, showing that Miguel is a more skilled fighter than he was in season 1, as well as that he was the better and more skilled fighter than Robby at that time. Arguably, however, Robby was angry and not focused because Miguel said that Sam loves him more than Robby, which is what gave Miguel the upper-hand on him.

   In season 3, he doesn't start training until later on due to his injury in the season 2 finale. When he starts walking and training again, his kicking is weak and he almost hurts himself, due to his legs not being back to full strength. Since his legs are not back to full form, this puts him at a disadvantage in his fight with Kyler, until he regains his confidence, with the latter then allowing him to defeat Kyler.

While she forbids him from doing karate after he is beaten up by Kyler and his gang, she is then persuaded by Johnny to let him do it. Following this, she doesn't seem to be as protective, though she seems ambivalent about the violence that continues to be involved. In the end of Season 1, she is seen cheering on Miguel from the beginning to the finals of the All Valley Tournament.

After this, she asks Miguel to leave her alone and their relationship ends for the rest of season 1.

   In season 2 , the two don't have much interaction. Initially, Miguel wants to make things right and rekindle their romance, but Sam wants nothing to do with him due to his actions. When spending more time with Tory, he falls for her and starts dating her instead. Sam, however, has bad blood with Tory and disapproves of Miguel dating her. She even confronts him about it, upsetting Miguel. On the night before the first day of school, a drunk Sam thanks Miguel for returning Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor, and the two share a kiss, but immediately regret it due to them already being in relationships. They are unaware of the fact that Tory saw them, which is what leads to Tory attacking Sam the next day in school, and to the fight between Miguel and Robby. After Robby flips Miguel over the railing, Sam is horrified both at what Robby did and Miguel's condition. At the hospital she tearfully says that she hopes Miguel is ok.

   Shortly after waking up from his coma in season 3, Sam visits him and gives him a get-well card, and the two apologize to each other for the whole situation.  Sam organizes fund raise for Miguel's surgery with the help of Miyagi-Do students. After Miguel is able to walk again, he returns to school and rekindles his friendship with Sam. Over time, they rekindle their former romantic feelings for each other and end up back together. Sam and Miguel work together to bring Eagle Fang and Miyagi-Do together, and by the end of season 3, Miguel is training with Sam and the other Eagle Fangs and Miyagi Dos at the Miyagi-Do dojo.

   Tory is Miguel's love interest in season 2. With Miguel initially being upset over his breakup with Sam, Tory, who had joined Cobra Kai and taken interest in Miguel, helps him get over his breakup. The two quickly become a couple, and while Miguel does not know the full extent of Tory's family background, he knows she works hard, and he s willing to defend her behavior against the criticism of others. Tory also has an influence on Miguel about what can be considered fair or not fair in fighting and in life. However, Tory witnesses Miguel and Sam kissing the night before the first day of school. In the school brawl that she instigates, Tory, still angry over the kiss, kicks Miguel's face when the latter tries to stop her from attacking Sam. She is horrified, however, when Miguel is kicked over the railing by Robby.

   The next time they see each other is while Miguel is at lunch with Johnny, who is posing for pictures for his Facebook profile. Tory sees him when Johnny goes to the bathroom. Miguel shows that he's upset with Tory for not coming to visit him in the hospital. He is further upset when Tory says that Cobra Kai is trying to get back at Miyagi-Do for what happened to him, while Tory voices her disappointment for his kiss with Sam. Miguel tells her that she needs help, but this angers her, as she feels he is calling her crazy. Miguel then breaks up with Tory for her role in severely injuring Sam and starting the school brawl, and then she leaves in anger.  The next time they see each other is when the Cobra Kai students enter Sam's house in order to attack the Miyagi Do and Eagle Fang students who had just formed a truce. Miguel tells Tory she doesn't have to do this, to which Tory says "it's too late". Then a fight breaks out, which Cobra Kai loses. Before Tory leaves, she calls both Miguel and Hawk traitors.

   Hawk is one of Miguel's closest friends. They meet in the school's cafeteria, where Demetri introduces them, and immediately become friendly due to being somewhat outsiders and bullied by Kyler and his gang. Eli joins Cobra Kai after witnessing Miguel using his skills from Cobra Kai training to beat up Kyler and his gang. After becoming Hawk, he would go on to become one of the top students along with Miguel. Despite Hawk's abrasive personality and actions, as well as the two getting into a fight over Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor that Hawk stole, they remain close friends. At the end of the school fight, when Miguel has fallen from the second story balcony. Hawk immediately recognizes Robby as the one responsible for this. He is also one of the first at the scene on the stairs and tries to wake Miguel up, but a policeperson tells him to back off. Hawk believes that their sensei, Johnny, is indirectly responsible for the situation Miguel is in.

   In Season 3, Hawk is one of the people who regularly visits Miguel in the hospital. He interrupts Sam's visit to Miguel and keeps the rivalry between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do alive, extending so far as to organizing the theft of the fundraising money for Miguel's surgery (though it is implied that the money does become contributed to the costs of the surgery in Cobra Kai's name). After Miguel is able to walk again, he returns to school, where he is welcomed back by Hawk. However, after learning from Demetri that Hawk broke Demetri's arm, Miguel confronts Hawk and shows disapproval about him letting Kreese get inside his head. Hawk's latest actions lead to their friendship ending. However, their friendship is likely rekindled when Hawk redeems himself by defecting from Cobra Kai and becoming part of Eagle Fang, joining forces with Miyagi-Do.

   Robby and Miguel have tense relations from the start. One could say he is Miguel's main rival. While the two don't have much interaction, they never have a positive one. Both dislike each other since their separate and unaware moments of first seeing the other. Their rivalry is similar to Daniel and Johnny's original rivalry, but on more personal levels. Miguel hates Robby for stealing Sam away and Robby hates him for stealing his father, who is Miguel's sensei.  In the penultimate episode of season 1, Miguel and Robby meet at a party, where Miguel has gotten drunk out of desperation over Sam not returning his texts or calls.  When Miguel sees his girlfriend and Robby walking together to the party, he is immediately jealous. Getting the wrong idea, he attacks Robby, but accidently pushes Sam in the process, leading her to dumping him. In the season 1 finale, Miguel and Robby face off in the All Valley Tournament, where Miguel viciously attacks Robby's shoulder which was injured thanks to Hawk in the semifinals, allowing him to defeat Robby and win the tournament, though it was a close match.

   In season 2, they don't have much interaction. When Miguel went to Daniel's house to return Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor that Hawk stole, he was shocked when Robby opened the door. He does not realize that Robby was not yet really together with Sam; he was there because the LaRusso's took him in after his mother abandons him for a short period. Still, Miguel gives him the medal, trusting that Robby will give it to Sam. Instead Robby, worried the admission would ruin his chances with Sam, pretends to find the medal in the Miyagi-Do dojo. Sam finds this out through Miguel at the party, but appreciates that Robby admitted it to her in the end before the school fight. When the school brawl starts,  Miguel becomes involved when he notices Robby is holding Tory, Miguel's girlfriend, against a locker. Unaware that Robby was trying to stop the fight, as well as believing he was attacking her, Miguel attacks Robby, causing the two to fight. Their fight is long and intense, and it appears to be evenly matched. Eventually, Miguel flips Robby and put his arm in lock, but after remembering Johnny telling him to show mercy, he lets Robby go and apologizes. Unfortunately, an enraged Robby attacks him again and flips him over the railing, resulting in Miguel falling on the stairs below and suffering a broken back. Horrified at what he had done, Robby runs away.

   Later in season 3, Robby, who was recently released from juvenile detention, sees Miguel, who is now walking again, with Sam. Getting the wrong idea, he tries to attack Miguel, only to be stopped by Sam. Robby then walks away and his relationship with Sam ends. Later, when Miguel and Sam show up at Cobra Kai to stop Daniel from further escalating his fight with Kreese, Robby comes out and tells all of them to leave.

   Daniel is Miguel's girlfriend's father and later his co-sensei. In Season 1, they see each other for the first time when Daniel goes to confront Johnny about Kyler being assaulted by Johnny. Johnny tells Daniel the truth about what happened, since it was really Kyler who had attacked Miguel. Daniel is shocked to know that Miguel is training under Johnny, and warns him not to be like him. Daniel tells his daughter to stay away from any Cobra Kai students, without knowing that Miguel and Sam are dating, which strains Sam's and Miguel's relationship. Miguel does not know about Daniel's advice about whom Sam should date, and he attempts to introduce himself to Daniel before thinking that Sam is actually interested in Robby, who happened to be eating dinner at the LaRusso house that evening.

   Miguel and Daniel do not interact directly over the first two seasons, seeing as Miguel is Johnny's student, though they see each other at numerous occasions, including the All Valley Tournament. There, Daniel witnesses Miguel using his signature move, the Crane Kick, against the opponent in the preliminary round, much to his chagrin.

   Upon meeting LaRusso for the first time after his recovery in season 3, Miguel starts to see that they have more in common than he previously believed, and he begins to respect LaRusso and his methods, as well as his perspective in the rivalry with Johnny. By the end of the season, Miguel trains at Miyagi-Do with the Miyagi Do's and Eagle Fang students, with both Daniel and Johnny as his co-senseis.
