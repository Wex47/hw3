   Alan was a Cobra Kai student, along with Johnny, Dutch, Bobby, Jimmy, Tommy, and many others.  He is present at the Cobra Kai Dojo when Daniel LaRusso enters the dojo.  He is later shown training in the dojo when Mister Miyagi and Daniel enter, seeking a peaceful end to their hostilities.  During the training session, Alan momentarily loses his concentration when sensei John Kreese is making his rounds.  Kreese immediately takes Alan to the ground, and admonishes him for losing his concentration in a fight.  Kreese then orders Alan to do 60 pushups on his knuckles as a punishment.   He is shown wearing a brown belt, and would thus be eligible to compete in the All Valley Karate Tournament.  If he did, then he did not advance to the elimination stage.   Alan is not shown in the parking lot after the event, but would have heard what happened in the parking lot when Kreese attacked Johnny and his friends.  Alan would leave Cobra Kai along with all of the other students over that.  Alan is not shown in any of the scenes that take place at West Valley High School and may not have even gone to school there, going to some other school in the valley and training at Cobra Kai.

She was one of the people who despises Daniel when they first meet, saying how she doesn't know what Ali see's in him. She was present in the crowd with Freddy and Ali during the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, and would be one of the many that swarmed Daniel after winning the tournament.

   Bruce is a member of the All Valley Karate Tournament, where he serves as a member of their council, and also doubles as the event announcer for the 1984 All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament.  He can be seen doing sign ins, answering questions and generally helping get people where they need to be.  He then acts as the public address announcer for the event.  He shows his displeasure and is very quick to announce Bobby Brown's disqualification when Brown lands an illegal strike against Daniel LaRusso's knee during the semi-finals.   Later, he is about to proclaim Johnny Lawrence as the 1984 champion, but is interrupted by Ali Mills, whom informs him that Daniel LaRusso will indeed fight.  When Daniel defeats Johnny in the 1984 Finals, he makes the proclamation and is about to give Daniel the trophy, but Johnny Lawrence takes it from Bruce to hand it over to Daniel himself.

He would witness the beginning of Daniel's relationship with Ali during the course of the day, and would be present to witness the first fight between Johnny and Daniel.  He would appear the next day in school during soccer tryouts, making several comments to Daniel about losing to Johnny the way he did.   He was present in the crowd with Freddy during the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament, and would be one of the many that swarmed Daniel after winning the tournament.

   The two yahoos are belligerent, drunken men who are at the beach when Daniel and Mr. Miyagi are busy training in the ocean, practicing balance. Mr. Miyagi and Daniel return to Mr. Miyagi's truck, to find two local yahoos there with beer bottles strewn all over the place. Both of them make condescending racial slurs against Mr. Miyagi, who kindly asks them to remove the bottles from the truck. Yahoo #1 mocks Mr. Miyagi's Asian appearance, and challenges him to do it himself with another racial slur. Calmly and with a single strike, Mr. Miyagi chops the beer bottles in half, which intimidates both yahoos; they immediately remove the bottles from the truck. Mr. Miyagi claims it is the first time he has ever done that.
