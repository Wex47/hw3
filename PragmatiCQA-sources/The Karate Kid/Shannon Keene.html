   Much of Shannon's early life is unknown but it's more than obvious her own problems started long before she ever met Johnny. Shannon and Johnny got together at some point well before 2002.  There was talk about a crazy relationship that they had together back then.

   Regardless,  Johnny ended up getting Shannon pregnant. Shannon gave birth to their son and only child, Robby on February 4, 2002.  Johnny by his own admission failed to be there for Robbie when he was born. At some point, Shannon and Johnny split up. Shannon however had to raise Robby throughout the latter's childhood by herself. Shannon didn't care that it was caused by the depression of Johnny losing his mother and the fact that Johnny was most upset about Robby never being able to meet his grandmother, Laura and Robby not having a single grandparent in life.  It is also likely that Sid cut off Johnny financially and kicked him out of his mansion when Laura died and Johnny was fending for himself for the first time.

   Shannon is a social alcoholic due to her near-constant presence at bars and taking various men home with her. She is also possibly unemployed as she mentions that she was at one of these bars to get a job application. When the bartender actually procures an employment form for her, she then declines. Shannon spends far more time bar-hopping and seducing men to get free meals from them, neglecting Robby not only directly, but also by failure to set any positive example. Even when Robby sets aside time to try and bond with her, Shannon leaves to go to happy hour anyway, blatantly stating her fear of being alone.

  <p key="3a8c965a-883c-46de-a236-9de10b4f61da">
   Despite her many flaws, however, she did choose to raise Robby, unlike Johnny. However, Shannon appears to be at her wit's end with Robby, letting him do whatever he wants, claiming that there are no do-overs in life, and that it was too late for Johnny to try and mend his relationship with his son. She also viewed Johnny's attempts at getting back into his son's life as superficial, surmising that his offer to mend fences with Robby and her as an effort to keep the law off his back about child support.

   , explaining how her decision to travel out of the country and leave Robby behind was a terrible mistake that she greatly regrets. Shannon claims that she is going to start going to rehab for her drinking and drug issues, and tells Robby that his father does care about him and that she was wrong to let her own problems with Johnny get in the way of how Robby views his father. She also tells Robby that he can go stay at his father's apartment and does not want any of her issues with Johnny to have Robby go against Johnny.

   Shannon tends to spend more time hanging out in bars and seducing men rather than spending time with Robby. However, she does love Robby and did spent most of Robby's childhood raising him due to Johnny neglecting him. Shannon's relationship with Johnny is strained, due to the latter not being there for Robby and basically forcing her to raise him. When Johnny begins to express a desire to mend his relationship with Robby, Shannon doesn't think he is being genuine. Despite her own large flaws Shannon is more than willing to point his faults and failings and views him as someone who ruined her life.

  <p key="9ee8b911-79e4-414f-808b-c40e160a0e98">
   At the start of season 2, she leaves Robby to travel with some man called Rick to Mexico. However, when she returns, she admits to Robby that she made a mistake leaving him and that she is going to rehab to fix her drinking and pill problem. Despite her anger with Johnny, she encourages Robby to have a relationship with him, as she knows that he truly does love Robby.

  <p key="331136e1-bc61-4bfa-8ddd-444de6612c18">
   In season 3, Shannon, who is now in rehab, appears to be more calm and better. She cares about Robby and is friendly with Daniel, but is still at odds with Johnny when he meets her at rehab. She talks to Robby through what happened and she reassures him that everything will be okay and gives him a sandwich to eat. When Robby is arrested by the police and taken to
   Sylmar Juvenile Corrections (SJDC)
   , Shannon is deeply sad and concerned for Robby's well-being and state.
