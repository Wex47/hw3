The fight is eventually stopped by Robby, who defends Kreese and attacks Johnny for being responsible for his suffering and trauma throughout his life. Johnny instantly switches to the defense and refuses to fight his son, though Robby is intent on unleashing his pent up anger. He shouts that Johnny is responsible for everything bad that's happened, and lunges. Johnny blocks Robby's attack and accidentally pushes him into the lockers. He hits his head and is unconscious, much to Johnny's dismay. Robby eventually regains consciousness, just as the fight between Johnny, Daniel, and Kreese is over. Robby stands next to Kreese much to the shock of Daniel, Johnny, Miguel, and Sam, who have all gathered outside the dojo. Robby coldly tells them to all leave, before retreating into the battered dojo with Kreese. He begins his training with Kreese to defend Cobra Kai in the tournament to determine which dojo will stay in the valley.

   Robby is a troubled teen with abandonment issues and no real source of authority, leading to his rebellion against rules and even laws. He befriends a group of teenagers and together, they con others into giving them what they want. Robby uses his good looks, charm, and cleverness to his advantage, even convincing a man to hand over his computer and password. He is also intellectual in both acadameia and street-smart, an attribute that he combines to survive his difficult home life. He has a tough exterior due to parental neglect, having to fend of himself, and a  lack of an adult to guide him. He hates the world and his father, holding a deep resentment for the man. After learning that Johnny is opening a dojo and looking to repair their relationship, Robby visits his father and sees him with

   It isn't long before Daniel's teachings begin to rub-off on Robby, coupled with the influence of Daniel's daughter
   Samantha
   . Robby has trouble adjusting to the new opportunities that Daniel gives him, and often falls into his old habits of being a troublemaker. He is reluctant to trust the LaRusso's, a symptom of his abandonment issues and lack of paternal figure. The longer Robby spends with Daniel and Sam, the more he opens up to them. He learns to channel his anger, find balance, and an understanding of not only his enemy, but himself as well. He has a kind nature and cares deeply for Sam, even having a relationship with her. Despite his growth, he struggles to let go of both his resentment towards Miguel and his general sense of anger. Through his relationship with Sam, Robby demonstrates jealousy over her former relationship with Miguel and worries about her lingering feelings for him.

   After scoring a point against Miguel in the All-Valley Tournament, Robby is merciful and tries to help Miguel up, but Miguel instead yanks Robby's injured shoulder. Despite losing to Miguel in the All-Valley Tournament, Daniel commends him for fighting with honor, which Robby appreciates. He also begins to forgive Johnny for their difficult past, coming to a mutual understanding for once. As Robby befriends the Miyagi-Do students, he shows an unwavering loyalty to them, willing to defend them in fights. His loyalty stretches to Daniel, who Robby holds in high regard, both as a man and as a sensei. When Sam is intoxicated after a party, Robby takes her to Johnny's house since it's the only safe place he can think of where neither of them will get in trouble. He hopes to protect not just himself, but Sam as well.

   While trying to save Sam from Tory and attempting to reason with the latter, Miguel ends up attacking him which leads to the school brawl. During the brawl Robby is pinned by Miguel, who then shows him mercy. However, an enraged Robby attacks Miguel and kicks him off a railing, resulting in the latter breaking his back. Now realizing what he has done, a horrified Robby runs away and attempts to hide from the repercussions. He is scared at the possibility of going to juvie, and guilt-ridden over what he did to Miguel. He reaches out to his rehabilitated mother, who in turn, contacts Daniel in the hopes he can help Robby. When Robby realizes that Daniel turned him into the police, Robby feels betrayed by the only positive male figure in his life. Even though this was ultimately to get him a shorter sentence, with Daniel repeatedly telling the cops to be gentle with Robby.

His resentment at Daniel and Johnny continues even after his release from juvie, as he coldly tells Daniel and Johnny to leave him alone. After witnessing Miguel and Sam together, he ends his relationship with Sam, as he feels betrayed yet again.

   Under Daniel's training, Robby develops into a smart and well-rounded fighter. When he is able to maintain focus, his style revolves around a solid defense and counter-striking, which is evinced in the semifinals and finals of the All Valley Tournament. However, when his emotions get the better of him, he can become blindly aggressive. His techniques mix solid basics with the occasional high risk spinning or aerial move. According to Daniel, Robby is naturally talented and this seems justified as he is able to execute Mr. Miyagi's double-leg handstand kick after only hearing a description of it. Furthermore, despite an injured shoulder, he is able to put up a tough fight in his final match against Miguel.

  <p key="8964784d-7471-4ca8-b2b3-ce278d66dce4">
   In season 2 Robby improves his fighting style and skills with Daniel's training. By becoming a better and more skilled fighter he is able to fend off several Cobra Kai students and put up a fight against Miguel during a school brawl. However, his emotions still gets the better of him at times, resulting him fighting more aggressively and blindly, which is evidenced during the school brawl where he aggressively attacks Miguel when the latter say that Sam loves him over Robby, and after Miguel lets Robby go. However, the latter attack results in him kicking Miguel off the railing, severely injuring him and rendering him unconscious as a result.

   Despite being a highly skilled fighter, he doesn't have it easy when fighting opponents who are just as strong and skilled as him. Sam is able to counter him while they practice during training, although they later appear to be evenly matched. After putting up a good fight against Miguel in the school brawl, the latter manages to eventually flip him and put his arm on lock. When Miguel lets go and apologizes however, Robby beats Miguel by attacking him, similar to how Miguel pulled Robby's shoulder when he tried to help him up at the tournament.

   Despite his injured shoulder putting him at a disadvantage and causing him to lose to Miguel in the All Valley Tournament at the end of season 1, he came close to beating him, showing that Robby was the better and more skilled fighter. In season 2, despite beating Miguel by kicking him off the railing, he could only do so when Miguel, who had pinned him to the ground, showed mercy by letting him go, showing that Robby was the inferior and less skilled fighter at that time.

  <p key="d3c192b2-ec41-41e7-bf30-dee16f27bb6d">
   While in juvie in season 3, Robby still maintains his skills, which he is able to use to fight and gain the respect of his bully Shawn. Later on when he fights Johnny (much after he is released from juvie), he goes against what he learned at Miyagi Do by fighting with hate. However, the more skilled and experienced Johnny counters his strikes, before accidentally pushing him into lockers. Robby doesn't seem to have gained more skills in season 3 due to him being in juvie for most of the season, and joining Cobra Kai just near end of the Season.

   John Kreese is Robby's new sensei, though to Kreese he is clearly a weapon and tool, not a student. when Kreese visits Robby in juvie during season 3, he ends up convincing Robby to act more aggressively, which he does against his bully Shawn. Preying on the already crestfallen and distraught Robby's anguish and confusion, Kreese poison's his mind to further turn him against Johnny and Daniel and to join Cobra Kai, which Robby does after being released from juvie later in the season. When Johnny is beating up Kreese, Robby defends him and attacks Johnny, only for Johnny to accidently knock him into lockers. Robby gets up and stands next to Kreese and tells Miguel, Sam, Daniel and Johnny to get out of here. He then walks back in the dojo with Kreese, as Robby lives in the dojo due to having no home and Shannon being in rehab still.
