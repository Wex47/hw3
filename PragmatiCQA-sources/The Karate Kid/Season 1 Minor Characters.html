   Daryl is a member of the All Valley Under 18 Karate Tournament Executive Committee.  He appears in the season one episode All Valley, where he is going over the upcoming 2018 Tournament.  He is a big advocate for changing the colors of the mats and the fists in the All Valley banners and mats to help give a new look and drive up attendance numbers, which have been slipping.  He is impassive at first when Johnny Lawrence appears before the committee to appeal the lifetime ban that was enacted against the Cobra Kai Dojo enacted after the 1985 tournament.  He is emphatic that he believes the Cobra Kai name is a great name for a karate dojo.  He remains in the room when a closed door vote is called for by council president Ron.  While his vote is now shown, based on the two votes that were clearly in favor of keeping the lifetime ban in place (Daniel LaRusso and George), it is believed he voted to reinstate Cobra Kai. He would also appear in the season one finale Mercy, where in addition to serving as an official for the event, also doubles as the main announcer for the event.

It is unknown how far he made it into the tournament as he isn't shown competing along with many other students.

On the day of the All Valley, he hears Johnny’s speech about No Mercy and is one of the students who ran out chanting Cobra Kai. It is unknown how far he made it into the tournament as he isn't shown competing along with many other students.

   George is a member of the All Valley Karate Tournament executive committee.  He appears in the season 1 episode ALL VALLEY, where the executive committee is discussing issues leading up to the upcoming 2018 karate tournament.  When Johnny Lawrence appears before the committee, he seconds fellow committee member Sue's assertion about some sort of mistake in 2017 with a corndog vendor.  He is confused at first when Johnny says he is there to appeal the lifetime ban on Cobra Kai, wondering if they even had the power to ban anyone.   When Daniel LaRusso appears and files are accessed, he reads out the 1985 executive committee's decision to ban Cobra Kai for the actions of John Kreese, Terry Silver, and Mike Barnes.  As the issue is discussed before the committee, George makes it clear that while he does not know Johnny Lawrence, that he knows Daniel LaRusso and backs his position that the ban on Cobra Kai from the All Valley Karate Tournament continue to remain in place.  He remains in the room when the closed door vote takes place, and it is assumed he voted to keep the ban.   He would later appear in the episode MERCY, in his capacity as an official overseeing the event.

   . He enters the Cobra Kai Dojo in his official capacity as a health inspector for the city health department.  Johnny at first believes he is a prospective student.  Keith is not impressed with the condition of the Cobra Kai Dojo safety status.  He and Johnny have an exchange where Keith informs Johnny of the requirements Johnny will need to bring the exercise studio up to code, as well as information Johnny will need to acquire the insurance he also needs to open the studio.  Before he leaves, he comments on what he thinks is a rattlesnake logo of the dojo, but is corrected by Johnny before he leaves.  Later in the epsiode, Johnny is shown filling out all of the forms and paperwork that Keith had left him.
