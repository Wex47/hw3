   for guidance, but the latter says there is no rank here and it's every man for themselves. Then, one of the soldiers throws the other into the pit, making Kreese uncomfortable. The soldier that won is brought back into the cage, where he reveals to

   Back at the Encino Oaks Country Club, Johnny and Daniel continue to banter as Ali shares stories from their past, and Amanda gleefully processes their stories. Ali helps Daniel and Johnny see that they are more alike than they'd like to admit and that both are equally responsible for the events leading to their rivalry; the two men accept the truth of this, allowing them to begin moving on. At the end of the evening, Daniel and Ali share an emotional parting in which Ali reflects, “we were so young, and the good times far outweighed the bad.”

   The action returns to the flashback in Vietnam.
   Captain Turner
   is lined up to be the next fighter, and the Vietnamese soldiers choose the terrified
   Terry Silver
   to be his opponent, much to the horror of Silver. However, Kreese stands up and volunteers to fight the captain in Silver's place. The captain, hoping to gain a psychological advantage, reveals the contents of a letter that he had previously kept hidden from Kreese:
   Betsy
   was killed in a car crash. As the captain laughs at and taunts a devastated Kreese about this, it is revealed that the pit over which the American soldiers were forced to fight is full of Cobras and many other venomous snakes.

   Back in the present day, an enraged Johnny, who learned of the LaRusso house fight, arrives at the Cobra Kai dojo, kicking in the door and finding Kreese training Robby. Kreese insists that three generations of Cobra Kai will “melt this whole snowflake generation,” but Johnny rejects Kreese’s offer to join forces and aggressively attacks Kreese, causing Kreese to fight back. The two have a big fight, as flashbacks of Kreese losing to Turner in their fight in Vietnam are being interspersed. Johnny and Kreese fight and both fight for the upper hand. Kreese sometimes has the upper hand, but Johnny has it for most of the fight. Eventually Kreese kicks Johnny in the stomach and sends him against the wall. Johnny gets one of the weapons and thinks about stabbing him, but drops the weapon when Robby shouts "Don't do it!". Johnny then slips Kreese onto the ground and starts repeatedly punching and battering Kreese's face, making it bleed badly until Robby intervenes, trying to fight his father. Johnny tries not to retaliate, but easily blocks and ends up accidentally throwing Robby into a locker, knocking him out in extremely brief momentary anger. Johnny regrets it immediately and then tries to help Robby.

   In the flashback, Kreese is on the verge of being thrown into the pit by Turner, and the latter berates him for being unable to shed his humanity. However, Kreese manages to regain his footing after stabbing him with a bamboo stick. Kreese then proceeds to overpower Turner, leading to Turner dangling over the pit and barely hanging on the edge. Back in the present day, he attacks Johnny from behind with a Sai and then after Johnny kicks the Sai away, Kreese puts him in a chokehold once Johnny's down, mirroring the beginning of

   The timelines continue to intersperse. Turner is seen dangling precariously over the snake pit and Kreese is one move away from killing Turner. When Kreese is about to defeat and murder Turner, the U.S. forces arrive, causing the Vietnamese soldiers to flee. Turner orders Kreese to pull him up, but this is when Turners' lessons come back to bite him, as Kreese tells him that while he did not follow his lessons, he won't make that mistake again. His final words to his Captain are "No Mercy", before stomping on Turners' left hand, which sends him plummeting into the cobra and venomous snake pit, ultimately leading to Turner being killed by venemous snake bites.

   Meanwhile in the present-day, Daniel, enraged that his house got raided, saves Johnny from Kreese’s chokehold and scolds Kreese for sending the Cobra Kais to attack his and Johnny's students. The fight spills outside and Kreese tries to stab Daniel with a large shard of broken glass, but Daniel employs the pressure point techniques he learned from
   Chozen
   and disables Kreese. At Daniel's mercy, Kreese is shocked that he was able to learn techniques Mr. Miyagi never taught him. Johnny appears at the broken glass area and witnesses a disabled Kreese to which he gives a nod of approval to Daniel, meaning it’s acceptable to finally kill Kreese. Sam and Miguel arrive in time to stop Daniel from delivering the heavy blow. Kreese proposes they settle this long-standing grudge the old fashioned way: with a tournament. Kreese promises that if they win the upcoming All Valley tournament, he'll leave. Robby stays with Kreese, while Sam and Miguel gather behind Daniel and Johnny.
