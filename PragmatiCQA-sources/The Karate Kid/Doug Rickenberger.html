   On the first day at school, Doug, Mikey, Hawk, and the other Cobra Kais witness Tory and Sam fighting over Miguel. When Robby intervenes and pushes Tory to a locker, Doug yells at Robby to let Tory go and attacks Robby, but Robby kicks Doug away from him, and Doug is caught by Mikey, and Hawk. This provokes Miguel to intervene and tackle Robby, which provokes a school brawl between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-do students.

As the dojos take the brawl up to the second floor, Doug can be seen in the background constantly punching a Miyagi-do student. Later on, Doug and Mikey can be seen attacking Robby on the stairs together along with Miguel, before he disperses to help Tory. Doug manages to get a hold of Robby, but Robby ends up breaking free from his grip and kicks Mikey down the stairs. Doug then turns back to Robby and attempts to kick him in the face, but Robby kicks Doug's other foot that was on the ground, causing Doug to fall and hit the ground hard.

The group ends up breaking into laser tag arena to drink beer, where they get attacked by Miyagi-do students. Doug at first, tries to stop the fight, but ends up helping Cobra Kai to fight off Miyagi-do. Initially, he finds himself being beaten by Sam, and the Miyagi Do's are gaining the upper hand. However, when Tory arrives with Big Red and Edwin, the tide begins to shift to the Cobra Kai's favor. Chris swings at Doug but he dodges and jumps behind him putting Chris in a chokehold. He and

He first fights Chris and their fight appears to be even, but he eventually beats him with the help of Tory. He then gets in a fight against Demetri and ends up grabbing Demetri's arm, then inviting Hawk to take a free shot on his victim. Hawk rushes in, but throws Doug at a glass table instead, thus switching sides during the fight. When Hawk and Demetri start fending off Hawk's former Cobra Kai's, Doug attacks Mitch. He is last seen fighting with Mitch. In the end, the Cobra Kai's ultimately lose the fight due to Hawk defecting.

Despite his ruthless behavior, he does have a little sense into him, as at arcade when Miyagi-Do is ready to attack, Doug at first, tries to stop the fight, but ends up helping Cobra Kai to fight off Miyagi-Do. He is very aggressive and merciless to his opponents, evidenced when Chris swings at Doug, but he dodges and jumps behind him, putting Chris in a chokehold and he continues to kick Chris even after he goes down. After Chris hits him with a pan during the house fight, Doug laughs it off and then proceeds to knee Chris and throw him to the ground.

   He has shown a good amount of strength, as he demonstrates this when he brutally elbows and throws a teacher over his shoulder. He easily overpowers the much taller and heavier Chris in the arcade fight, brutally kicks an unnamed Miyagi-do student down during the school fight, and takes down another unnamed Miyagi-Do student during the fight in Sam's house. He easily beats Demetri, only out of bullying with another unnamed Cobra Kai student. He is also shown to be fairly acrobatic, as he almost manages to kick down the Miyagi-do plant, though he fails. His greatest ability is to properly show his toughness, as when Chris hits him with a pan during the fight at Sam's house, Doug just laughs it off, and goes on to knee Chris in the stomach before throwing him into a door.

  <p key="4c408412-6be7-4ed5-a6b6-24bc18672cda">
   His fighting style seems to mostly incorporate takedowns, as he mostly throws his opponents around with brute force and strength. He is very aggressive and merciless to his opponents, as evidenced when he continues to kick Chris even after he goes down, and pins Demetri and urges Hawk to take a shot at him. He also has enough strength to defeat skilled opponents like Chris and Demetri.

   Despite being a very strong fighter, he has lost in a few fights. In the school brawl, he is easily beaten and swept to the ground by Robby. In the arcade fight, he is being easily beaten by Sam. During the fight at Sam's house, he is thrown on to a glass table by Hawk in mere seconds. However, in the latter situation, Doug is caught off guard, as he did not expect Hawk to switch sides and attack him.

   Doug is overall one of the strongest students and fighters at Cobra Kai.
