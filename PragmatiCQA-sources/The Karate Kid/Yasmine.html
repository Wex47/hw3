   Yasmine realizes she empathizes with him, especially now that she herself is a laughingstock. She later catches up with Demetri and signs the cast in such a way that makes it look like the two of them are together, turning Kyler's cruelty into a potential boost for Demetri's reputation.

   Despite her consistently toxic attitude Yasmine is a popular student. Smug and arrogant, she picks on and looks down on people she views as low status, most notably Aisha, and to a good extent Eli and Demetri.  Aside from being a bully herself she is openly amused by Kyler's bullying.  She is easily manipulated at one point by Kyler, after he lies to her about Samantha saying she is better than her, indicating a possible deep-seated insecurity. Her popularity finally comes to an end when Aisha finally gets her revenge by giving her a wedgie in front of a huge crowd, making her a laughingstock in front of her classmates.

   Yasmine returns in season 3, at first displaying her old attitude. However, she is no longer queen of the school, and is made fun of by the other students for the wedgie incident instead. After being partnered with Demetri on a school project, she begins to see him in a new light, and her personality begins to soften somewhat. After Kyler draws a penis on Demetri's arm cast, causing a lunchroom full of students to laugh at him, Yasmine does not look amused; instead, for the first time in the series, she looks concerned about another person. When she signs and counter-graffiti's Demetri's cast later, it's the first act of kindness we have seen from her, and when Demetri tells her that he knows how she feels about being made fun of, her face lights up in a genuine smile. This later blossoms into an actual attraction.

   Yasmine does not bully anyone throughout season 3, indicating that she's becoming a better person. However, she remains very prideful, saying that she would never date a "freak" like Demetri after she's caught kissing him by Miguel and Sam. However, even as she insults Demetri she makes eyes at him and touches his chest as she departs.

   Losing her status has clearly taught Yasmine at least a little humility, and her concern for Demetri shows that she has also gained empathy as she was herself a laughingstock after her wedgie incident in

After Kyler draws a penis on his cast Yasmine shows sympathy by signing his cast and telling him she now knows what it feels like to be laughed at since the wedgie incident.  She looks visibly touched when Demetri sympathizes with her in return. Later she is caught kissing Demetri by Miguel and Sam, but out of embarrassment she insults Demetri and says she would never date him, although she gives him a flirtatious look and touches his chest before she leaves.

In season 3, despite having no interactions, Yasmine is upset when Kyler bullies Demetri, as the wedgie incident she suffered in late season 1 has instilled some humility in her and made her realize she knows how it feels to be a laughing stock. It can be assumed that Yasmine no longer likes Kyler, due to her change in attitude.

   Aisha is Yasmine's former bully victim. In season 1, she often bullies Aisha because of her weight. During the Halloween party, Yasmine posts a cruel pig meme of her eating Cheetos during the Halloween dance causing several people to mock her, which deeply upsets Aisha. Later in the season, when the Cobra Kai students crash Yasmine's party at the Canyon, she confronts Aisha, who tells her they were here first. Yasmine then insults her and walks away, only for Aisha to stop her and finally get revenge for the latter's constant bullying by giving her a wedgie in front of everyone, making several people laugh at her. Humiliated, Yasmine runs away.

   In season 2, Aisha and Yasmine don't interact because of Yasmine being in France, but when Moon shows Aisha a photo of Yasmine in France, Aisha angrily says she should stay in France.

   When Yasmine returns to school in season 3, she is still being mocked for the wedgie incident; afterwards, she voices her disgust to Moon about the nerds running the school, and asks Moon if Aisha is the queen of this. Moon says Aisha transferred schools after the fight, causing Yasmine to express approval. Later in the season, when Demetri finds himself being bullied by Kyler, Yasmine shows him sympathy by telling him that she has known the feeling of being the laughingstock since the wedgie incident.

   Interestingly, both Yasmine and Aisha indirectly helped each other, as Yasmine's constant bullying led to Aisha joining Cobra Kai, which eventually helped her stand up for herself and get revenge on her, while Aisha giving Yasmine a wedgie taught her humility and to be a more nice and empathetic person.

   In season 1, Yasmine crashes her car into Johnny's Pontiac Firebird in a parking lot. An enraged Johnny screams that Yasmine, Moon and Sam, scaring them as a result and causing Yasmine to drive away. Johnny's car winds up being towed to Daniel's auto dealership for repairs, resulting in the two old rivals seeing each other for the first time in many years. While Sam shows guilt over what happened, Yasmine rationalizes that the dangerous-looking, scruffy man would have chained the three girls up in his basement.

   Despite not interacting with Johnny since the accident, this accident ls indirectly a reason that Johnny's rivalry with Daniel is renewed. This accident is also an indirect reason for Johnny's life after.
