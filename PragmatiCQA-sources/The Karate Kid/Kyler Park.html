   Yasmine is Kyler's former friend, assistant, and now enemy. They were part of the rude and popular crowd. When Kyler, Brucks, Yasmine and Moon come to the lake to celebrate Yasmine's birthday, they see it is crowded with members of Cobra Kai and Miyagi Do. Yasmine wants Kyler to tell everyone at the lake to get out, but after seeing Miguel, Kyler is scared and suggests they go somewhere else, causing an angry Yasmine to call him a coward. While Kyler and Brucks leave, Yasmine stays because Moon goes to the lake. Later, Yasmine is unhappy when Kyler bullies Demetri, because the wedgie incident she suffered at the lake made her realize how being a laughingstock feels.
