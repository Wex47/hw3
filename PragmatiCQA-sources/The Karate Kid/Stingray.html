   Raymond said he lives alone with his mother. It is unknown what kind of relationship he has with his dad, or that his father is deceased. His mother appears to be overly worried about her son, not allowing him to do activities or demanding he pay his share of housing. He seems to have stood up to his mother's overprotectiveness to some extent, finally deciding to enroll in a dojo against her wishes. When he was approaching

   , he says that he can afford tuition as he saved money from living rent free. This shows Raymond has some sense of thriftiness. Johnny does not seem excited about this kind of agreement; agreeing to allow Raymond to enroll mainly because he is a paying customer.

   Stingray is mentioned during the PTA meeting, when of the parents asks about Raymond.  Principal Lopez immediately chimes in that Stingray was never employed in any capacity at West Valley High School. It is also said because he is an adult, he was arrested for participating in the brawl. The charges are never specified, but is likely for assault or assault on a minor. Raymond was sentenced to an unspecified term of probation, as well as being bound to a restraining order that he is not to have any form of contact with minors. As a result, Raymond was forced to relinquish his membership at Cobra Kai once and for all.

   Raymond argues with his neighbor, Greg, over playing metal music too loud the night before. Raymond reveals that he is officially off probation and free to return to his prior life. He tries to return to Cobra Kai, completely unaware of everything that has happened since the school fight. He makes his case to return, but John Kreese refuses to accept him, demeaning him in front of eveyrone at the dojo. In a desperate act to be with his former friends, Raymond visits the

   junior prom. He wants Bert to tell everyone that he's hosting a huge after party at his house. Word spreads, and his party is very well attended by the students. When Greg tries to shut down the party, Stingray accosts him once again. Outside, Miguel and Sam fight against Tory and Robby. When Sam, Tory, and Miguel are pushed by Robby into the swimming pool, Stingray celebrates by jumping in the pool, saying that it's the greatest day of his life.

After delivering a beating, he promises to make him a student if he does something for him first. He delivers a powerful blow to the head that renders Stingray unconscious. He wakes up in the hospital and names his assailant as

   Raymond is in very poor shape and has a glass jaw. After adopting Kreese's ruthless teachings, Raymond becomes an aggressive fighter; this is evidenced in the school brawl, where he aggressively attacks several Miyagi-Do students. He even uses his stomach to attack the students in order to protect Hawk. While hosting an afterparty, he beats up his neighbor after insulting him, which shows that he still is a formidable fighter. He, however, is nothing in comparison to experienced fighters such as Terry Silver as Silver easily defeats him, though he doesn't try to defend himself, possibly because Terry is a master who he probably didn't want to disrepair. He also drops his guard in the first place, since he didn't expect to get attacked by Silver.

   Raymond tries to present himself as happy-go-lucky and a joker, but is usually seen as boorish and irritating by others, namely Daniel and Johnny. The only known adult who seems to tolerate Raymond to some degree is Kreese, who approves of his tactics in winning the "red vs black" training event. Raymond lives in the past and is desperate to reclaim his youth, choosing to live vicariously through the Cobra Kai dojo students. He desperately wants to be part of something that will give him a purpose, as opposed to what he views as a meaningless job. He avoids responsibility at all costs and dreads the thought of being viewed as old. His cluelessness as an adult and great incompetence in general become very apparent during Moon's party, when he tapes bottles to his hands and tries to run from the police. He did have sufficient self-confidence to woo a girlfriend; however, she did remark to Raymond when being invited to Moon's party that the guests were considerably younger than himself. Raymond seems to prefer the company of those significantly younger than he is, both in keeping with his delusions and desperation to avoid acknowledging his own age.

   While it seemed that Raymond was able to be competent to some degree in a blue-collar job as he worked at the hardware superstore, he lacked the ability to handle himself in a professional setting when he was being interviewed by Principal Lopez at the high school. During the school brawl, Stingray intervenes and attacks many students who are minors. This lands him in legal trouble with a restraining order, probation, and a jail sentence. Upon his release, Raymond demonstrates that he hasn't learned a single thing from his antics. Instead, he believes his willingness to fight in the school brawl should earn him a spot in Cobra Kai or a thank you from the sensei's. He proves he's not only immature and obnoxious, but extremely self-deluded and insecure as well. Even when he's had harsh and true facts said right to his face he adheres to his foolish self beliefs. Even when viciously beaten by Silver, he goes along with his plan to frame Kreese so he can be let back into Cobra Kai, which shows how insecure and desperate he is.
