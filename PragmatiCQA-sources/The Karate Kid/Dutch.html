  <p key="246e9927-d903-4720-867a-c30238551a5d">
   Dutch was a vicious bully. However he was a lot more cruel and vicious than the other Cobra Kai members among his batch. Some instances of his cruelty include unwilling to show mercy to Daniel while beating him up at the park, taking pleasure in taunting and intimidating Daniel prior to the all valley tournament, and approving of Kreese telling Bobby to put Daniel out of commission. The fact that he was the only Cobra Kai student that approved of Kreese instructing Bobby to put Daniel out of commission shows how vicious and cruel he is (Even Johnny disapproved Kreese's actions).
  </p>
  <p key="417e0cec-5e6a-4656-ad02-d1314b813a1d">
   Not only was Dutch a bully, he was a troublemaker as well. When he was a teenager he broke a dartboard at a bar which resulted in him going to Juvie for the first time. During his adulthood he committed a serious and unknown crime which resulted in him being sentenced to anywhere between 5 and 20 years in prison.
  </p>
  <p key="f6cec10c-b7f0-4103-81b8-e4ebab46d6cc">
   Dutch can be considered one of the most aggressive Cobra Kai member due to his hot headed attitude. Dutch could be considered the stupidest member as well, unlike the other four who heeded Kreese's orders to stop harassing Daniel; Dutch was willing to attack Daniel in the locker room of the All-Valley Sports Arena, even in plain sight of a referee; nearly risking his disqualification until the referee forced him to back away. However, it is possible that he was not planning to fight Daniel in the locker room, and was instead just trying to intimidate him. He could be considered also the most mean Cobra Kai students due to his vicious behavior, and him being one of the few Cobra Kai students not to have any redeemable qualities.
  </p>
  <p key="790accd2-2a45-4f64-8a14-adc09e32ecd3">
   All five of the Cobra gang had some inkling how their behavior in their youth mirrored their adult lives. As Dutch apparently had a total lack of moral compass, he suffered the unhappiest ending of becoming a felon. It is possible that before joining Cobra Kai, Dutch was a bullied child with anger issues and the Dojo may have turned him into a bully.

   Dutch is a very strong fighter and follows the Cobra Kai motto to the letter as seen during his match against Daniel. He managed to land a strong crescent kick to Daniel's face, hurting his eye, but he was then kicked after going for a punch. Despite showing some skill, Dutch's cockiness seems to get the better of him, as he's shown to attack without thinking first.
