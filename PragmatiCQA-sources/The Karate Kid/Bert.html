   Bert has a much smaller role. He is still a student at the Cobra Kai. When Johnny punishes Aisha and the others for goofing off by teaching them about concrete, Bert is seen mixing the concrete with the others (but not one of the boys made to push the cement drum). In Episode 9 he is seen welcoming

   takes over that could be attributed to him being in the principal's office because of his fight with Nathaniel. Since he was more than willing to attack a Miyagi-Do student it can be implied that Bert has been corrupted by Kreese's ruthless teachings, or it may have been motivated by his rivalry and disdain for Nathaniel.

   After two weeks later, Bert returns to school because he was suspended because of the fight with Nathaniel. He encounters Hawk and
   Mitch
   proceeds to walk, but they are confronted by their rivals Demetri, Chris, and Nathaniel. After verbal comment,
   Counselor Blatt
   shows up and asks if everything is ok before saying they should walk away.

   In the Cobra Kai Dojo, Kreese brings the hamster and asks his student Bert what he should name the hamster, he gives him the name "Clarence". Kreese then shows a snake to the class and orders Bert to feed it. Kreese says that Clarence is going to be the snake's next meal. When Bert refuses to give the hamster up, Kreese acts sympathetic and asks the whole class who else thinks that the Clarence should live. Kreese then kicks everyone who objected out of Cobra Kai. Bert is shocked and confused at this and asks Kreese what he just did. Kreese then notions for Bert to get out of the dojo and then yells at him to get out. Bert then slowly walks away from the dojo while Kreese feeds Clarence to the snake.

   It is hinted that Bert was mocked by Hawk and the Cobra Kai gang due to getting kicked out by Kreese as Hawk motioned a kicked out Mitch to go to the "rejects" table where Bert and another former Cobra Kai were sitting at. Bert later joins Johnny's

   Dojo. On one night, Bert and the other Eagle Fang's students are invited to
   Samantha LaRusso's
   house, where Sam says they should work together. Initially, Bert along with the others, sans Miguel and Sam, are against this, but end up agreeing after Demetri makes a speech about needing to work together in order to stand up to Cobra Kai.

   Bert is kicked through the window at the LaRusso house, showing his love for animals, as he is tricked into thinking it was the LaRusso's cat, which, in reality, was a trap set by Cobra Kai ordered by Kreese. Bert and the others are then attacked by several of the Cobra Kai's. Despite struggling for a while, Bert and his friends prevail, partly because of Hawk having a change of heart and turning on the Cobra Kai's. The following morning, Bert, the other Eagle Fang's and Hawk show up at Miyagi Do, and all of them start learning with the Miyagi Do students under the leadership of Johnny and Daniel. Having befriended each other, Nathaniel and Bert shake hands before standing together as the training begins.

   Bert strikes first, like the Cobra Kai mentality. However, Bert is possibly the weakest Cobra Kai student, as he loses almost all the fights he is shown participating in. In the All Valley Tournament, he is easily beaten by his opponent, who is much bigger than him. During the school brawl, he is bested by Nathaniel's superior defense and offense, even after Bert manages to break his glasses.

   In season 3, Bert's fighting seems to improve slightly. He is shown to kick aggressively while training with Johnny. While participating in the fight in Sam's house, Bert does have some success early on, managing to kick a Cobra Kai with the help of Demetri swinging him in the air. While Bert and Nathaniel would soon be on the losing end against another Cobra Kai, Bert is later shown kicking the same Cobra Kai after Hawk changes sides.

  <p key="ea228055-2fbf-44ec-b158-f61a487e95b5">
   Bert all around may be the weakest Cobra Kai student, and possibly the weakest fighter in the franchise.

  <p key="92e6f74a-8b43-4524-a046-3553f34b6568">
   With the merge between Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang, Bert's skills will drastically improve as he was one of Johnny's original students when he was still running Cobra Kai and now combining Daniel's way of teaching will make him a stronger fighter.
