   Demetri is still at odds with Hawk. However he is becoming friendly with Yasmine, due to her lack of popularity. In the cafeteria he shows off his dinosaur valley project/diorama, which impresses Moon and to an extent Yasmine. Hawk then destroys his project, upsetting Demetri, who mocks his sleep enuresis. Later that day (most likely), he gets revenge on Hawk in a soccer game by calling him a loser that lost the 'hottest' girl (
   Moon

   Tory

After momentarily hesitating, Hawk breaks Demetri's arm after being peer pressured by Tory and the other Cobra Kais, causing Demetri to scream in pain, but Hawk shows some discomfort as Demetri screams in pain, showing remorse for taking this out of hand with his former best friend.

However, Kyler's bullying earns Demetri the sympathy of Yasmine, who knows how it feels to be a laughingstock since the

Then, Demetri, Hawk and Miguel run to the Miyagi Training Building in the back of the house after defeating the Cobra's, where Sam has just disarmed Tory. Hawk tells Tory that the fight is over.

   Demetri is a minor character in season 1. His screen-time is limited and he doesn't have any sort of story-line. Outside his self esteem issues and friendship with Miguel and Eli, nothing is known of him. In season 2, Demetri's character is more developed. His sarcasm is still present, but has reduced significantly. At first, he attempts to re-enroll in Cobra Kai, but after Kreese hits him, he writes a negative review about the dojo, which results in his best friend Hawk, ending their friendship and bullying him. Not wanting to be bullied anymore, he eventually joins Miyagi-Do Karate. Despite struggling and still showing lack of confidence, as time goes by he is able to learn the Miyagi-Do Karate techniques, which allows him to become more confident and a better fighter. After Hawk pours beer on his head at Moon's party, Demetri who is fed up with Hawk's bullying, decides to tell embarrassing stories about him in front of the other attendees (namely, Hawk's bawling when Dobby dies while the two watched

   During the school karate war, Hawk chases Demetri who tries to get away from him, but Hawk eventually catches up to him and starts attacking him. Demetri, however, uses his Miyagi-Do Karate technique to defend himself. He then kicks Hawk into a trophy case, injuring him as a result, though he does apologize, showing that he still cares about him despite the latter's constant bullying.

  <p key="5cb5f829-3c60-4b67-be1c-6920a666abb8">
   In season 3, Demetri is shown to no longer be afraid of Hawk. He even has newfound popularity after defeating Hawk in the school brawl. Growing more confidence and assertiveness due to his arising popularity with his new laid-back personality, he does stand up to Hawk by pushing and leg sweeping him to the ground. After Hawk breaks his arm and Kyler mocks his cast, Demetri earns the sympathy of Yasmine, who is now nicer to him due to her knowing what it's like to be mocked after the

   . The two are caught kissing by Miguel and Sam, but Yasmine denies wanting to date him. When Sam tries to get Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang Karate to work together, Demetri makes a speech that they need to work together to defeat Cobra Kai. He is also later seen as a mediator between the two, ironing out the details of their alliance. Agreeing that all should train at Miyagi-Do Dojo, but deadlocked on team name, gi design, post training snacks and sensei dispute protocol. During a fight at Sam's house, Demetri helps defend Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang, who, thanks to his speech, formed an alliance. He is saved by Hawk, who has realized the error of his ways, and the two reconcile their friendship and work together to defeat several Cobra Kai's. Demetri stands up for his best friend when Tory threatens Hawk for defecting, telling Tory that Hawk's friends will be watching his back. The day after the fight, Hawk has joined Eagle Fang and the two are shown high fiving and hugging. Demetri has grown from an awkward and sarcastic nerd, to a capable and more confident and assertive fighter and person, and he also became more and more kind-hearted and forgiving when he forgave Hawk after everything he put him through. Demetri's sense of humor is featured more than it was in season 2, but not as much as it was in season 1.

   Demetri is not a natural fighter. He is never seen fighting until he joins Miyagi-Do, and even there he struggles with technique. However, he does benefit from his sharp intellect, instantly deducing that Daniel's painting and sanding chores are muscle memory exercises. Daniel eventually makes use of Demetri's intelligence, presenting a blocking drill as a puzzle to be solved. This helps Demetri become a fairly solid defender, making him the opposite of the aggressive Hawk. During his fight with Hawk, he successfully uses the Miyagi-Do technique to counter all of his former friend's strikes, finally defeating him by kicking him into a trophy case. Demetri's lack of strength is compensated by his speed; he is a very fast runner. Demetri is able to consistently outrun people, including five physically fit Cobra Kai students (

   Along his speed, Demetri does have physical strength and it's still improving a long way since season 2. During the soccer game in season 3, Demetri kicked the ball so hard into Mikey that he falls to the ground hard. He is able to defeat a much larger and bigger Chris in training and take down several Cobras, with that of being a fast and somewhat powerful Miyagi-Do fighter.

   Demetri's skills are shown to have improved in season 3, which is most notably evidenced in the LaRusso house fight, where he fights off a few Cobra Kai's himself, while defending the smaller Bert and Nate at the same time, swinging Bert around for higher kicks, and manages to take down several Cobra Kai after teaming up with a redeemed Hawk. He, however, is easily beat by Hawk in the laser tag fight, due to the latter being more focused. Demetri's best fighting comes when both he and Hawk team up to take down several Cobra Kai's in the LaRusso house fight (Mentioned above), which makes them a complimentary and effective duo. Using Bert and Nate shows that he can use other people for height advantages. Overall, Demetri's offense, defense and overall technique have all significantly improved, all of which make him a better fighter.

   Despite his short skills, Demetri was close to losing to Hawk in the School Brawl in season 2. However, he uses his Miyagi-Do Karate techniques to defend himself. He kicks Hawk into the trophy case, defeating him and as a result. However, it is evident that Hawk lost due to underestimation and being caught off guard by Demetri's defense. In the Arcade Fight in season 3, Demetri was easily pinned and beaten by Hawk to breaking his arm, showing that Demetri is far weaker than Hawk, also refuting the claim that Demetri is stronger than Hawk.

   Now that he is apart of the merged Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang Karate, Demetri's training continues by re-learning Johnny's aggressive offense tactics when he enrolled in the re-opened Cobra Kai. If he uses Johnny's aggressive offense &amp; Daniel's effective defense techniques, he can improve his speed by applying it to both offense and defense with his increasing striking power even more and Demetri will become a stronger fighter.

  <p key="42d5e1eb-39d3-4001-9a6b-66420eae50c5">
   Demetri can be seen as one of the stronger fighters among Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang.

   Hawk is Demetri's brother figure and former main rival/enemy. They became friends in childhood, long before the events of Cobra Kai. They became friends due to their similar interests, and possibly because of their shared unpopular status. They become friends with Miguel in season 1 of Cobra Kai. Halfway into season 1 they join Cobra Kai, though Demetri quits after being embarrassed by Johnny. Despite quitting, the two are still friends.

   In season 2, their friendship becomes strained when Demetri complains to him about being hit by Kreese, but Hawk insults him and shows no sympathy. Their friendship comes to an end after Demetri writes a bad review about Cobra Kai due to Kreese hitting him, causing Hawk to attack him in the mall along with some of his Cobra Kai friends.

   , which appears to work as Hawk seems interested, but then it sours when Demetri suggests Hawk gain inner peace, causing Hawk to respond by dumping beer on his head. Furious over the treatment, Demetri gets revenge by telling everyone embarrassing stories about Hawk, enraging the latter. The following morning during the school brawl, Hawk attempts to get revenge by chasing Demetri across the school and attacking him, but is defeated in the end when the latter uses his Miyagi-Do tactics to counter the attack, before kicking him into a trophy case, though he does apologize, showing that he still cares about him despite the latter's constant bullying.

   In season 3, his enmity with Hawk continues. Demetri stands up to Hawk on a few occasions, while Hawk begins to show some remorse for his aggression after breaking his arm. Eventually, Hawk's conscience reaches its peak and their friendship is ultimately rekindled during the fight at the LaRusso house, when Hawk finally recognizes the error of his ways and apologizes to him. Although reluctant, he still accepts Hawk's apology and the two friends agree to fight off the Cobra Kais, winning in the process. Afterwards Demetri, alongside Hawk and Miguel, stop Tory and Sam's fight. He stands up for Hawk when an angry Tory threatens him. Later, the two share a handshake and a hug as they stand together when Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang begin training together.

   Miguel is one of Demetri's best friends. After meeting in the cafeteria in season 1 of Cobra Kai, Demetri and Eli quickly befriend him. Miguel is something of an outcast, which helps him bond with Demetri.  Halfway into the season Demetri attempts to join Cobra Kai after witnessing Miguel beat Kyler and his gang, but ends up quitting after being humiliated and physically hurt by Johnny Lawrence. Despite quitting he remains close with Miguel, and even tells Miguel that he doesn't need Cobra Kai because he has him.

   After the school brawl, Demetri buys Miguel a comic book as a get better present. After Miguel got recovered, he returns to school and Demetri was happy to see him fully recovered. Miguel is concerned when he sees Demetri's broken arm and Demetri tells him how his arm got broken by his own former best friend Hawk. This causes Miguel to confront Hawk about this. While Miguel is arguing with Hawk, he witnesses Kyler drawn a penis on Demetri's cast, this makes everyone to laugh but except for Miguel who is not laughing and feels bad for him, and shows disgust to Kyler. Also, both Miguel and Sam see Demetri and Yasmine kissing and this makes Miguel shocked to see that Demetri is dating Yasmine. During the house brawl, Hawk restores his friendship with Miguel and Demetri after he defects from Cobra Kai. In the end, all three manage to stop Tory and Sam from fighting and Demetri defends Hawk. By the end of the season the trio are training together with the other Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang students.

   Sam is also one of Demetri's best friends. They first meet when Demetri decides to join Miyagi-Do. Despite both being in Miyagi-Do they don't have much interaction. The only time they are shown together outside of class is when the two and Robby are eating at the mall. Although Demetri seems to slightly annoy Sam at times with his antics she is always friendly and supportive towards him, constantly defending him whenever he's threatened as she knows Demetri couldn't defend himself at first.

   Early on, Demetri assures Sam they're on the same side against Cobra Kai. When Demetri's science project gets destroyed by Hawk and the two begin a dispute, Sam immediately goes to Demetri's side to give him support, and tells Hawk to back off or he "won't be lucky", showing her care for Demetri's feelings. Sam encourages Demetri and some of the other Miyagi-Do student to get aggressive with the Cobra Kais during a school soccer game, but this earns them detention. After Nathaniel is beaten up by Cobra Kai Sam re-opens Miyagi-Do, with Demetri rejoining. After Demetri gets his arm broken by Hawk, Sam feels tremendous remorse over being unable to help her friend. In the finale, when Sam's attempt to unify Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang almost fails, Demetri gives an impassioned speech that leads to the dojos successfully merging. He then seems to take charge of the discussion. Their meeting is interrupted when the Cobra Kai students attack the merged dojos. Both Sam and Demetri defend the LaRusso house and win in the end thanks to Hawk's defection. He alongside Miguel and Hawk stop Tory and Sam's fight. They are then seen back at Miyagi-Do, training for the tournament against Cobra Kai. As Sam is the senior student in Miyagi-do, Demetri looks to her for leadership and backs her up when she tries to take the fight to the Cobra Kai students. Even after his arm is broken during the Laser Tag fight Demetri remains loyal to Sam.

   Although their relationship is initially strained, over time Daniel becomes a father figure to Demetri. Demetri seeks to join Miyagi-do after getting assaulted by Kreese back at the Cobra Kai Dojo. Daniel starts Demetri's training by having him do chores around the dojo, which Demetri instantly deduces are muscle memory exercises. Once Demetri completes the chores Daniel teaches him self-defense. At first Demetri complains about it because he is not used to fighting. Annoyed, Daniel asks Demetri why he joined Miyagi-Do. Demetri responds that he has been unpopular throughout his life, and now the few friends he does have are joining Cobra Kai and becoming jerks.  Daniel then starts to understand him and decides to go more slow on his training that with his other students. Demetri struggles with his training, but Daniel realizes the key is to appeal to Demetri's keen intellect, presenting martial arts as a puzzle to be solved.  This finally clicks and Demetri begins to gain both skill and confidence. Overall, despite their rocky start, Daniel had a lot of patience with Demetri and this ultimately paid off.

   In season 3 Demetri and Daniel don't interact until later in the season but when he's informed about the fallout of the arcade fight, Daniel is angry to find out that the Cobra Kai students broke Demetri's arm. The first time they are together is when Miyagi-Do is going through basic drills and Demetri is having trouble. A frustrated Daniel tells him that if he doesn't follow what they're learning he will be back in that cast. The last time they are together is the the last scene of the finale, when Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang have merged and are now training and being run by Daniel and Johnny.

   Yasmine looks disgusted when Demetri attempts to chat with her. She is initially rude to Demetri, but begins to warm up to him when she sees the dinosaur model he created for their group science project. After Kyler draws a penis on his cast, Yasmine shows sympathy by signing his cast and telling him she now knows what it feels like to be laughed at since the wedgie incident; when Demetri sympathizes with her in return, she looks visibly touched. Later she is caught kissing Demetri by Miguel and Sam, but out of embarrassment she insults Demetri and says she would never date him, although she gives him a flirtatious look and touches his chest before she leaves.

After his arm is injured, Demetri finds himself again being bullied by Kyler. When Demetri accidentally bumps into Kyler in the cafeteria, he throws Demetri's lunch to the bin and the latter draws a penis on his cast and shows it to everyone, causing many to laugh — except for Miguel, Yasmine and the other Miyagi-Do students, who feel bad for him. Later in the hallway, Kyler smacks Demetri and mocks him for the defaced cast.
