   Sid was an executive producer for Lorimar Television, which is now defunct. At Lorimar, Sid gained a reputation for abusing subordinates. At one point, Sid bragged about how he told his subordinates that he was the one "who runs Lorimar". This reputation stayed with him for the remainder of his life. Sid's work with Lorimar allowed him to be become wealthy, and he used his wealth to enjoy a fabulous house and memberships to country clubs. At some point after 1967, Sid married Laura and became the stepfather to Johnny when the latter was a kid. Sid, however, disliked Johnny and constantly made a point to berate and bully him. When Johnny told Laura he wanted to take lessons at the
   <a href="Cobra Kai Dojo.html" key="5b7c1667-d5b8-4954-a4e1-b0bf6295f421" title="Cobra Kai Dojo">

   </a>
   , Sid ridiculed him and cited Johnny's many failures at drums, magic sets, and other diversions and calls him a reject.  Sid ultimately decided to allow Johnny to take lessons after being persuaded by Laura.  It is unknown what Sid thought of the changes in Johnny after he joined Cobra Kai and began to dominate the All-Valley Karate scene as well as date a girl from a highly respected family in the community (Ali Mills), but Sid allowed Johnny access to the Encino Oaks Country Club as well as a brand new
   1983 Avanti Convertible
   and
   Honda XL 600R
   motorcycles  for Johnny (and possibly all of his Cobra Kai inner circle friends) at some point prior to the 1984 All Valley Karate Tournament.

   After losing to Daniel in 1984 (which Sid undoubtedly rubbed in his face) and being disillusioned by Kreese and quitting Cobra Kai, Johnny was subjected to further verbal abuse from Sid, this time with no place to turn. According to Sid, Johnny continued to freeload off of Sid, and Johnny would admit later to Ali that after high school, he  "partied his entire 20's and most of the 30's away".   Whether it was for Laura or not, Sid continued to allow Johnny to have access to the Encino Oaks Country Club, and would even forbid the club from banning Johnny for vandalism he and Dutch did in the mid 1990's (vandalism which Dutch was prosecuted for).

   Following Laura's death in January 2002, days before Robby's birth, his relationship with Johnny became even worse. With Laura gone, and with Johnny continuing to 'freeload' off him, as Sid often claimed,  Sid kicked Johnny out of his house, although Sid claims he has continued to look after Johnny to a point during these years, as he promised Laura he would do so.

   Sid bails Johnny out of jail over his latest infraction, and  laments how much of a burden Johnny has been to him. He reminds Johnny of the promise he had made to Laura to always look out for Johnny, but says that it has come to an end. Sid then gives him a check in an attempt to buy him out of his life. Johnny refuses and tears up the check, possibly remembering his rough childhood, when Sid emotionally abused him. However, when he re-opens up the

   After the Dojo becomes successful, Johnny recoups the money used to buy it, then returns to see Sid at his home. He gives Sid all of his money back that he used to open the dojo and tells Sid that he never intends to see him again after Sid claims that he "needs [his] money", saying: “I never needed your money. It’s just the only thing you had to give. Goodbye, Sid.”, leaving Sid to stun in disbelief as he can no longer use his money to control or show any kind of superiority towards Johnny anymore.

   Johnny arrives to Sid's house in request of some money to help fund Miguel's surgery. Sid mocks him for many reasons, believing he was a loser just like his
   father
   . Johnny then threatens to speak out to the public of a secret incident that Sid had with a secretary. After claiming that he didn't achieve financial success due to his reputation, he angrily tells Johnny to get out, in which Johnny does, but steals an expensive object belonging to Sid on his way out in order to sell and pay for Miguel's surgery as payback for the way he treated Johnny.

   Despite his wife, Laura, being a kind and caring mother for her son, Sid was a selfish and rude man who detested his stepson and berated whatever he was interested in. Sid also refers to Johnny as a social reject. Sid said that Johnny failed at drums and could not make use of a magic set, to which Laura pleaded to nurture Johnny's interest in the

   , thinking it will help him make friends. Sid approved this on the basis this will be another example of wasted talent. Johnny ended up being dedicated to his lessons, ironically causing

   Sid was verbally abusive to Johnny, saying that he would never amount to much and frequently calling him a "shithead.” Laura died in January 2002 just days before the birth of her grandson Robby, which changed Sid’s relationship with Johnny from a strained one into outright hostility. Johnny, in turn, realizes something Laura apparently never caught on to, that Sid never truly loved his mother nor valued her as a human being. Sid married Laura to have her as a trophy wife, and grudgingly raised Johnny as he had been her child from a previous marriage and refused to acknowledge him as his own.
  </p>
  <p key="8bad8122-6389-451d-baac-e12c41d80675">
   It's quite clear that Sid believes being nice never got a person anywhere and believes that some people are born as losers. He has been seen in the company of an African-American woman named
   Rhonda
   , who is his live-in nurse. Rhonda apparently does not enjoy the pleasure of Sid's company, only being near him as it is her duty and she is on his payroll. One time when Sid was groaning over a meal and the doorbell rang, Rhonda bluntly stated she is paid to be Sid's nurse, not his cook nor maid. It is revealed that Sid's disdain was not reserved solely for Johnny.

  <p key="d660cb41-4bef-4bd3-a745-25ab27dd5691">
   Despite detesting Johnny, Sid kept his promise to Laura that he would take care of Johnny, which he did by bailing him out of jail more than once, and continued to do so from Laura's death in 2002 all the way to the fall of 2018.  Sid eventually tried to buy him out of his life after he felt that Johnny was no longer worth it. However, after Johnny's newly reopened Cobra Kai became a success, Johnny returned all of Sid's money (money he gave Johnny to buy him out of his life) he used to re-open Cobra Kai and told him he would never see him again. At first, an arrogant Sid said he still needed him because of his money, only to be rebuffed by Johnny who told him he never needed his money, shocking Sid, and leaving him speechless. It is likely that Sid realized he could no longer bully Johnny or use money to control him, after Johnny gave back his money and walked out of his life for good.

   When Johnny later visits him to ask for money to help with Miguel's surgery, Sid is still shown to be a cold and mean spirited human being that mocks Johnny. Johnny then gets angry and nearly makes a fist as he looks like he is about to attack Sid, who gets scared and tells him to ease it down. Then, Sid refuses to help him. He also doesn't care when Johnny threatens to speak about a public event with his secretary, as he doesn't care about his reputation. When Johnny leaves, he calls Sid a cold and bitter old man that doesn't deserve to live anymore.

   It was unclear if Sid will make any further appearances initially, as it was assumed that Johnny would never contact with him completely, in which Johnny would then later visit him at his home to ask for help in order to pay for Miguel's surgery. Failing to do so however, this will most likely be Johnny's last encounter with him because of his advanced age and Johnny needing no financial support after Miguel's surgery being paid.

   As Ed Asner sadly passed away before Cobra Kai season 4, it could be highly possible that his character will die as well. Asner died well after filming for Season 4 was complete, and in an interview, it was implied by show runners he may appear in Season 4 if scenes were filmed before his death. Unless they call in cast to film some sort of scene with him after his death in real life, his in-Cobra Kai universe death won't be acknowledged until Season 5.

    Sid's name is likely an obvious reference to Sid Sheinberg, who was president and CEO of MCA Inc. and Universal Studios for over 40 years. Like Sid Weinberg was the president of Lorimar Television, another entertainment company.

    Assuming Sid is approximately the same age as his actor, Ed Asner (89 years old when Cobra Kai season 1 debuted and 2018), then Sid would almost certainly have come of age at a time that most young men either volunteered or were drafted into the US Military.  Sid is of an age that he may have seen combat in Korea, and Johnny's failing in the US Air Force would be something that Sid would REALLY hold against him.

    It was implied that he sexually harassed his secretary since the Me too movement stands against sexual harassment.
