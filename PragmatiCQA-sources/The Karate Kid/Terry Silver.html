While in captivity, Ponytail was executed much to Silver's horror, and the rest of their team was imprisoned and forced to fight for the North Vietnamese’s amusement above a pit of venomous snakes.

   Upon returning to the valley, Silver and Kreese were greeted by hippie's who called them murderers. The protests against the Vietnam war had turned them from heroes to outcasts. They wanted to teach the world respect and discipline through the ways of karate. Silver, coming from a financially wealthy background, agreed to help Kreese open

This crushed Kreese, who didn't think he could open the dojo without Silver there to help as a co-sensei. Silver promised to be there for him someday, but that day couldn't be now. He would still be a major financial backer.

   enemies
   . He first sent Kreese to Tahiti to recover from the severe hand wounds inflicted by Mr. Miyagi. Next, he bought him twenty new dojos in the Valley. After reading about a karate “Bad Boy”
   Mike Barnes
   , he hired him to defeat and terrify Daniel. After hiring Mike, he had his thugs and Mike force Daniel to enter the All Valley Karate Tournament. He also pretended to train Daniel for the tournament, after Mr. Miyagi refused to do so, though his motives were later revealed to be part of an elaborate plan to have Daniel perform acts that directly conflicted with every value he learned from Mr. Miyagi's training, as well as physically harm him.

   He effectively gained Daniel's interest in the Cobra Kai training method. He used such tactics, as driving a convertible blue Ford pickup truck and wearing a shirt with an altered collar to appear “humble.” He had Daniel perform tasks such as “QuickSilver” method, but his deficient technique caused Daniel to injure himself, which amused Silver who laughed at Daniel's injury. He was fulfilling Kreese's wish for Daniel to suffer. He even paid a man to harass Daniel to entice him into violence.

   When Daniel later told Silver that he would not compete in the tournament, Silver revealed his true motivation to Daniel and ordered Barnes to assault him, while he and Kreese taunted Daniel. Suddenly, Mr. Miyagi arrived and easily beat both Barnes and Kreese. Silver verbally mocked Mr. Miyagi and then attacked. Mr. Miyagi countered his strikes and used minimum and well-trained offense to defeat him. After being defeated, Silver found himself mocked by Mr. Miyagi. Angry and unafraid, Silver warned that Cobra Kai would one day open around the town and he would ensure Mr. Miyagi was forgotten. However, Daniel retaliated by saying that Silver, Barnes, and Kreese would be the forgotten ones, rather than Mr. Miyagi.

   Following Barnes victory at the penultimate match of the All Valley Tournament, Silver gave a speech where he claimed that they would open multiple Cobra Kai Dojos to instill the same values that he was taught. Prior to the finals, Terry ordered Barnes to keep the score tied until the sudden death round by committing illegal moves, to cause Daniel the utmost pain possible, before ultimately beating him in the end. At one point during the match, he told Daniel that this was when the real pain began. However, Daniel, via encouragement from Mr. Miyagi, used the kata he was taught to defeat Mike in the sudden death match. He scored the winning point and won the championship. Disgusted and humiliated, Terry walked out of the arena with his plans having failed.

He eventually lost his fortune and company, becoming a broke and bitter man. He decided to better himself and got therapy to work through his psychological issues. He learned to put the past behind him and start over. He rebuilt his empire and put the world of Cobra Kai to rest. He ceased communication with Kreese and eventually got a girlfriend, who he backed financially for an app release. His love for the finer things in life continued as he became vegan, calmer, and more accepting of the world he lived in.

   Terry Silver is Kreese's best friend, having fought together in Vietnam. After Kreese saved his life in Vietnam, Silver promised Kreese that he owed him for the rest of his life, and the two went on to be good friends. After they were discharged from the military, Silver founded the Cobra Kai Dojo and enlisted Kreese as the sensei. In

   , Kreese, who lost all his students following his actions in the aftermath of the 1984 All Valley, accepts defeat by handing the keys to Silver. However, Silver refuses to let him give up and concocts a revenge scheme. While Kreese is insistent that Silver doesn't owe him anything, Silver reminds Kreese that he saved his life countless amounts of time. Unfortunately, Silver's plan fails when Daniel defeats Mike Barnes in the

   thanks to his friend John Kreese. After learning how Daniel and his sensei led to the fall of Cobra Kai, Terry took it upon himself to enact revenge on Daniel for his best friend. He hired Mike Barnes to defeat LaRusso on the All Valley tournament and later made Mike force Daniel to sign an application to the tournament when he refused. Terry and Mike both eventually orchestrated a staged fight where Barnes would attack Daniel so that Silver could "rescue" him in order to gain his trust. Terry also made sure to Daniel that he could count on him whenever he needed to train at the Cobra Kai Dojo.

   Daniel eventually arrived at the Cobra Kai Dojo and asked Terry to train him for the tournament after Miyagi didn't approve to him competing. During their training, Terry greatly enjoyed seeing Daniel hurt himself with the QuickSilver method, maniacally laughing in secret. He turned Daniel into a violent person and continued to fuel this "killer instinct" when he paid a man to harass Daniel at a nightclub. When Terry finally revealed his true intentions to Daniel he took great pleasure in seeing him scared and beaten during most of the tournament, as he instructed Mike Barnes to score a point and lose that point over and over so that Daniel would experience more pain until the sudden death round. Though this all was for nothing as Daniel won the tournament and destroyed all of Terry's plans in the process.

   , Terry seemed to have left a big impact on Daniel even years later, as he never told anyone about the time he joined Cobra Kai and became violent, not even his own daughter.
