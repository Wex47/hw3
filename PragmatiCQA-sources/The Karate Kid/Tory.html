   Tory grew up in poverty, as her mother was a waitress that struggled to make ends meet. After work, her mother would often bring leftover food from the restaurant home, so she could feed her children. One night, Tory's mother was caught red-handed by the manager and fired for stealing from the job, despite the fact the food would have been disposed of anyway. This incident shaped Tory's worldview and philosophy on life; the world is a cruel and harsh place and one should react by looking out for one's self.

Tory's arrival proves to be the turning point, as the Cobra Kai's gain the edge and defeat Miyagi Do. After beating Miyagi-Do, she tells Sam to show herself, but the latter is sitting in the corner with a look of fear on her face. When Hawk has hold of
   Demetri
   's arm, Tory, along with the other Cobra Kai members, encourages Hawk to break his arm, which he does. At class the next day, Tory admits that she did not actually think Hawk was going to break Demetri's arm. She then helps weed out the "unworthy" Cobra Kai recruits particularly in a sparring match against a girl named
   Sarah
   . After the match, Sarah lashes out at Tory saying “You chipped my tooth, bitch!”, to which Tory insults Sarah telling her that she “needed braces anyway”. She also appeared shocked when Hawk brutally beats up Brucks a few moments later at his match.

   When Tory is in the probation office, she encounters Robby, who is angry at her for starting the fight. She rebuts that while she started the high school karate war, he ended it. She knows that it is unfair that they get probation while everyone else is scolded, and warns him that Sam will turn him, much to his anger. Before leaving, she tells Robby to check stable in the home life section, since they will not check.  While staying at Cobra Kai, Robby is noticed by Tory, who mocks him for trying to run away. She says channeling in the hate will make him stronger. Later on, Tory invites him to hang out with some of the Cobra Kai members. That day, the two along with Hawk,
   Kyler
   and some other Cobra Kai members break into the zoo, and Robby steals a snake for Kreese. After returning to the dojo with the snake, Kreese informs them about Miguel and Sam working together, angering both Tory and Robby. Kreese then dismisses the class, causing Tory to storm out.

She misses, and instead hits and breaks a photo of Mr. Miyagi. Sam, now angry and letting go of her fear, dodges Tory's attacks and picks up a bō staff. The two then fight, with Sam eventually managing to disarm Tory and corner her against the wall with Sam winning. Hawk, who had just defected from Cobra Kai, alongside Miguel and Demetri arrive, and Hawk tells Tory the fight is over. Tory tells Sam the fight will never be over, with Sam responding that she knows where to find her. Tory then calls Hawk and Miguel traitors, tells Hawk to watch his back and turns to leave.  Before she goes, Demetri tells her that Hawk has friends who will watch his back for him.

   Before joining Cobra Kai, Tory trained in kickboxing. After joining the dojo, she immediately demonstrates considerable aggression and some decent grappling techniques, performing a few takedowns and a joint lock during her match with Miguel. Her striking technique is a bit rough but she makes up for it with her natural strength, speed, aggression, and fearlessness. She can hold her own against the technically proficient Samantha. Tory is a ruthless fighter who is more than willing to use weapons against an unarmed opponent if she feels the need.
  </p>
  <p key="a2adcd62-e572-4917-853d-b4b19a819c57">
   The longer she trains, Tory's striking technique visibly improves, making her even more formidable. She also receives some training with nunchaku, using them against Sam who wields a bo staff. However, Sam's skill with the bo staff is still greater, allowing her to disarm and corner Tory. Kreese describes Tory as "a born fighter".

   In season 2, there are two sides to Tory. In relaxed settings she is playful, fun-loving, and has a bit of a wild streak. She is assertive and has a sarcastic sense of humor. She enjoys being out with her friends as much as any teenager. She is openly flirtatious to Miguel, taking an interest in whatever he's doing and later, trying her best to help him get over Samantha.
  </p>
  <p key="c9bf1159-6933-42b0-bc57-7f059de780e2">
   She also seems to be very friendly to Aisha, with both viewing each other as their Cobra Kai rivals.
  </p>
  <p key="f9267590-3ed0-4331-a8b0-01c44859aa06">
   Underneath that exterior, however, Tory believes that life is about fighting for what you see as yours, as she explains to Miguel. She can be a bully particularly to Sam who she views as uptight, privileged and worst of all her competition for Miguel. She is highly vengeful if she feels like she's been wronged. After witnessing Sam and Miguel kissing, she attempts to get revenge the next day by threatening Sam over the school intercom, viciously attacking her and resorting to dirty tactics, such as cutting her with a spiked bracelet but was ultimately beaten by her.

  <p key="f2bddbe1-9c87-4838-860e-a38bf175f931">
   In season 3, she becomes more aggressive, especially after returning to Cobra Kai. She is easily able to scare and intimidate Sam, with the latter being so traumatized by their fight during the school brawl. During the arcade fight, she aggressively calls out Sam's name, which then causes Sam to suffer a panic attack and basically shut down out of fear. She is corrupted by Kreese's teachings to the point that she becomes more aggressive and ruthless than most of the students. When Robby thinks about leaving Cobra Kai, Tory persuades him to stay and even says that he will become stronger by channeling in his anger, with the latter showing how much she has been corrupted by Kreese's teachings. After Sam overcomes her fear and disarms Tory in their fight at Miyagi Do, Tory tells her that this is not over and she even threatens Hawk. Season 3 shows that Tory has become one of Kreese's most corrupt students, alongside Robby.

   Sam is Tory's biggest rival. Upon their first encounter in season 2, the two immediately dislike each other, with Tory disliking Sam for being privileged. When Sam puts accuses Tory of stealing her mom's wallet, their rivalry escalates, particularly on Tory's end, who has no issues with bullying and insulting Sam. After witnessing Sam and her boyfriend kissing, Tory exacts revenge the following day by exposing Sam in front of everyone (including Robby) and attacks her, all of which leads to the massive school brawl. At one point during the fight, Tory uses her spiked bracelet to attack Sam. Despite injuring Sam with the bracelet, she loses the fight when Sam kicks her down the stairs.

   In season 3, it is revealed that Tory was expelled for instigating the fight. Later, in the season, when the Miyagi Do's and Cobra Kai's are fighting in the arcade, Tory calls out her name, but then Sam suffers a panic attack and basically shuts down, as she is still traumatized over her fight with Tory in the school brawl. Tory goads her to come out, but she doesn't. In the finale, when Tory spots Sam during the fight at the latters house, Sam runs away, while Tory chases her into Miyagi Do and attacks her with nunchaku's, but Sam overcomes her fear and starts to fight back, ultimately resulting in Sam managing to disarm Tory with her Bo staff. The fight is then interrupted by Miguel, Hawk and Demetri coming in, with Hawk telling Tory to stop the fight. Tory tells Sam that this won't be over, to which Sam says "you know where to find me."

   While at lunch with Johnny in season 3, Tory sees him when Johnny goes to the bathroom. Miguel shows that he's upset with Tory for not seeing him in the hospital. He is further upset when Tory says that Cobra Kai is trying to get back at Miyagi Do for what happened to him, while Tory voices her disappointment for his kiss with Sam. Miguel then tells her that she needs help, which angers her, as she feels he is calling her crazy. Miguel breaks up with Tory for severely injuring Sam and starting the school brawl, and then she leaves in anger. The next time they see each other is when the Cobra Kai's enter Sam's house in order to attack the Miyagi Do and Eagle Fang students, who had just formed a truce. Miguel tells Tory she doesn't have to do this, to which Tory says it's to late. Then, a fight breaks out, with Cobra Kai losing. Before Tory leaves following losing the fight, she calls both Miguel and Hawk traitors.

After his confrontation with her landlord, Tory returns to Cobra Kai. Tory gets more corrupted by Kreese's teachings.
