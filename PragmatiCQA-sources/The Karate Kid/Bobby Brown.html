   's second-best student. Although one of Johnny's gang (as he trips Daniel at the first day of school soccer tryouts, prompting Daniel to ground-and-pound Bobby, thus getting Daniel kicked out of the tryouts), Bobby is seen as a more compassionate character than his friends, as he tries to stop Johnny from ruining the beach party, harassing Daniel, and doing further damage to Daniel during the fight alongside the South Sea apartments during the Halloween party (neglecting the other four members' rebuking and brushing off Brown's wishes).

   During the Semi-Final of the tournament, Bobby insists that he can beat Daniel fair and square, but Kreese orders him to put Daniel "out of commission". Bobby protests that he will get disqualified ("But I'll be disqualified!"), possibly hiding how he thinks doing such a thing is unethical. Bobby reluctantly obeys Kreese by landing a kick to Daniel's knee, severely injuring him. After the kick, Bobby drops down and sincerely and profusely apologizes to a pain-stricken Daniel before being pulled off Daniel, and is disqualified. Because Daniel was unable to continue at that time, he was the only Cobra Kai matched against Daniel whom he did not traditionally defeat, although Daniel indirectly won that match on account of disqualification.

   Sometime between 1984 and 2018, Bobby was ordained as a pastor in a Christian church, which reflects his retention of morality, despite training under Kreese's vicious and unethical teachings. Bobby also dons a wedding ring which implies that he married someone.  Johnny cites a incident in Reno, Nevada involving a bunch of soccer moms at the Hyatt, and cited Bobby's drinking, fighting, partying and being a 'bad ass' , indicating that he was still part of Johnny's antics at least as recently as the mid 1990's.

   . Like Jimmy and Tommy, Bobby is shocked when Johnny informs them that he not only reopened Cobra Kai but welcomed Kreese back into his life, which the three disapprove of. Bobby has no clue to why Johnny would do such a thing, only for Johnny to retort that in Bobby's job there is a "book that preaches a lot about forgiveness". While Bobby agrees that his career has been based on the Bible, he has his reservations that Kreese may double-cross Johnny at some point.  He also indicates he has been writing Dutch during his incarceration for whatever unnamed crimes he committed. The following morning Bobby desperately tries to get Tommy to wake up, only to start crying along with Jimmy when it is revealed that he is dead (Tommy passed away in his sleep).

Unfortunately, the plan to visit Robby fails, as instead of going, Johnny stays in the hospital to be there with Miguel for his surgery turnout, which angers Robby. Bobby tries to get Robby to talk and tell him what's going on, as he notices his bruises near his eye, he could pass it on to Johnny, but Robby then leaves instead. Bobby isn't seen after this, but Johnny apologizes to him over the phone. Later on, when Robby is doing research on Kreese, an article about a 1983 all valley tournament he finds states that Bobby beat Vidal in the third place match.

   Similar to the Cobra Kai, Bobby bullies and harasses Daniel. However, unlike his other fellow Cobra members especially Johnny and Dutch, he is the most compassionate, and knows when to draw the line. He frequently has to tell his group, particularity Johnny to relax whenever things are going too far, and he shows remorse when he performs an unethical action, such as putting Daniel out of commission during the tournament. He seems to not partake in harassing Daniel that much.

   has been diagnosed with most likely some form of cancer, he has been praying more. When Johnny reveals that he has reopened the Cobra Kai dojo and Kreese is back, Bobby voices his concern and reminds him of what Kreese and Cobra Kai did to them, showing that Bobby still hasn't gotten over Kreese's unethical teachings and does not trust him. Bobby warns Johnny that Kreese will eventually betray him again. He still has his fighting skills as he is able to help Johnny fight against a group of guys causing trouble. He is distraught when Tommy dies.

   When Johnny comes to Bobby, following Miguel's severe injury and Robby going to prison, Bobby comforts Johnny by telling him not to blame himself and that he needs to be there for Miguel and Robby. He also agrees to come with him to see Robby in juvie. This situation may imply that Johnny trusts Bobby the most among all his friends.

   His attitude seems to be dryer than the other Cobras. When first being reunited, Johnny remarks how Bobby has gone bald and figured all that praying should have made him regain the long hair he had when they first met. Bobby chuckles and remarks "God does not work that way".

  <p key="746650d4-3048-4122-8264-e15cbc204cb4">
   Despite changing for the better the most among his Cobra Kai friends, he hasn't completely shed his teenage self, as he does help Johnny and his friends fight off a group of guys causing trouble in a bar, and he himself kicks Johnny for showing up at his church drunk during his sermon with the congregation at the church. He also still holds a grudge against Kreese for the way he treated himself and the other Cobra Kai's when they were teenagers.

   Back in the 80's Bobby was one of the best students at the Cobra Kai Dojo, during the all valley tournament he demonstrates his prowess by giving some strong and effective kicks as wells as sweeps that he used to knock some opponents to the ground. Bobby was so confident on his skills that he believed that he could defeat Daniel if sensei Kreese hadn't told him about to put him out of commission, even then, Bobby delivered a great kick to Daniel's knee which LaRusso couldn't block or see coming at all.

  <p key="8cd10075-2bbb-4cfa-85d6-199af31eff7d">
   By adulthood and despite seemingly stopping practicing karate (at least regularly), Bobby remains a very competent fighter, being able to deliver some strong kicks during a fight at a bar and even sweep his friend Johnny when he interrupted one of his sermons at the church.
