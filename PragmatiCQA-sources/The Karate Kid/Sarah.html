Earlier, she informs the All Valley Karate Tournament of the intent for the city to cancel their permit for the upcoming 2019 All Valley Karate Tournament, due to the continuing lingering tensions that came from the brawl at West Valley High School.  She would hold an open hearing for the Northridge City Council, and her hearing would be attended by all three of the sensei's, as well as many of their students.  During the hearings she hears testimony from John Kreese, Daniel LaRusso, and Johnny Lawrence.  She also orders Amanda LaRusso to be removed from the chamber when she is informed that John Kreese has a legal restraining order preventing her from being within 100 feet of him.  She seemed to be heading to keep the ban in place, but is swayed otherwise by an impassioned set of speeches by Samantha LaRusso and Miguel Diaz.

This was shown during the car wash scene when all of Miyagi-Do tries to raise money for Miguel's surgery. He has seen again when the Miyagi-Do students take a stand during what escalates into an intense soccer game, even though Lil Red was not seen being involved. Just like many other's, Lil Red joins Sam when trying to open back up Miyagi-Do but fail's to do so once Sam's mother show's up.
