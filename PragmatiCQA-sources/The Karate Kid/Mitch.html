   When Kreese brings new recruits to Cobra Kai, Mitch attempts to mess with newcomer
   Kyler
   , by insulting him, but quickly gets scared and backs away when Kyler snaps at him. When class starts, Kreese orders Mitch and Kyler to spar. At first, Mitch lands a kick on Kyler just for fun, most likely in an attempt to scare him and gets a point. Kyler then warns Mitch that he will beat him. Mitch, on the other hand still underestimates Kyler. He starts to throw basic strikes and kicks (he kicks after throwing a few strikes) at Kyler, but Kyler keeps dodging them. Kyler then uses Mitch's second kick to get the upper hand, grabbing on to his leg while Mitch's kick was in the air, and then throwing Mitch down to the ground. Kyler then locks Mitch with a choke. Mitch taps out and Kyler lands a final punch to him, losing in the process. Kreese responds to the loss by kicking Mitch out of Cobra Kai. Mitch looks at Kyler and Brucks in shock and Brucks mocks him by going on a fake fighting stance. He then looks at Hawk with desperation, implying that he wants Hawk to defend him. Hawk then protests Kreese's decision, stating that Mitch has been loyal to the dojo, but Kreese states that Mitch is not Cobra Kai material.

Mitch protests the offer at first, but Demetri manages to convince him that it would be for the greater good.

   He causes trouble alongside his friends, such as taking the money for Miguel's surgery from Nathaniel and beating him up, (though Mitch says he'll make sure Miguel gets the money and surgery), as well as creating trouble and fighting with the Miyagi-Do's in the arcade. However, after being kicked out by Kreese for losing to an untrained Kyler, leading him to be shunned and mocked by his former classmates, he joins Johnny's Eagle Fang Karate Dojo. Upon being requested by Sam for Miyagi Do and Eagle Fang to work together, Mitch protests and proceeds to leave with Bert, but ultimately agrees to the truce after Demetri gives a speech about how they need to work together to beat Cobra Kai. The following morning, both Mitch and Chris have rekindled their friendship, and he begins training at Miyagi-Do with Chris, and other Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang students.

   Mitch's skills are rather limited. After joining Cobra Kai, he gains some decent striking ability and has enough power to knock down the larger Chris. Despite being an aggressive fighter, his offense is reckless and easy to exploit, while his defense is weak and easy to exploit. He has no ground game at all, tapping out immediately when Kyler locks him in a choke hold, and being taken out fairly easily by Chris during the arcade showdown. Although his defense isn't the best his kicking skills are fairly impressive, as seen during the school fight and training with Miguel and Johnny after joining Eagle Fang Karate.
  </p>
  <p key="48efb573-786a-41a8-a79f-ab4574703478">
   During his fight with Chris in the school fight at the end of season 2, the latter's superior defense and solid offense gives him the upper hand, until Mitch eventually kicks him to the ground. However, Mitch then loses when Chris knocks him out with a book, which may indicate that Mitch's reaction time is slow. During the arcade fight in season 3, Mitch and Chris fight, with the latter's more solid defense and technique allowing him to beat him with ease. Mitch eventually gets his revenge and steps in when Doug and Chris are fighting, and the two beat him up. During his fight with Mikey at Sam's house at the end of season 3, Mitch has the upper hand, landing more hits and managing to knock him down until his back is turned, whilst trying to help Demetri, which allows Mikey come from behind and resume the fight, but Mitch proceeds to gain the upper hand again. Due to Johnny's new teaching at Eagle Fang, Mitch was easily able to take out Mikey with good defence and offense.
  </p>
  <p key="38da08fc-e428-46c3-ae27-5bf27395ca10">
   Mitch seems to also lose concentration and underestimate his opponents, which also adds up to one of his biggest weaknesses. During his match with Kyler, it was obvious that Mitch could have beaten him if he did not provoke Kyler for fun and then underestimate him. This is proven when compared to how he managed to skillfully almost beat Chris in the school brawl. If Mitch can channel in his lack of concentration and cockiness he could become a great fighter down the line.
  </p>
  <p key="f2a5173b-b771-40dc-a4e6-c93b57944f09">
   With the merge with Miyagi-Do, Mitch may be able to combine Johnny's aggressive offensive style and Kreese's tactics with Daniel's effective defensive techniques, which should improve his fighting style.
