Sato and Mr. Miyagi had studied karate together under Mr. Miyagi's father, in defiance of what was then the strict one-to-one father-to-son tradition of karate. One day, Mr. Miyagi had announced before the whole town that he wanted to marry Yukie. Sato had been insulted and had challenged Mr. Miyagi to a fight to the death. Rather than fight his best friend, Mr. Miyagi left Japan.

   ), to whom Daniel is immediately attracted. They learn that Sato has now become a rich industrialist, whose
   supertrawlers
   have destroyed the local fish population, impoverishing the other villagers, who have turned to small farming to survive. Worse yet, all the villagers are now forced to rent their property from Sato, who now actually owns the entire village. Yukie also reveals that because she truly loved Mr. Miyagi and carried a torch for him, she never married Sato.

   Despite Mr. Miyagi's father's dying wish for his son and student to make peace with each other, Sato still insists on fighting Mr. Miyagi, though, after his sensei's passing, he gives Mr. Miyagi three days to mourn, out of respect for his sensei. Daniel comforts Mr. Miyagi, admitting that when his own father passed away, Daniel thought he had not been a very good son, but eventually realized that by being at his father's side when he was dying and getting to say goodbye to him was the greatest thing he could have done for him. Mr. Miyagi shows Daniel that the secret to his family's karate lies in a
   handheld drum that beats itself when twisted back and forth
   . This "drum technique," as Mr. Miyagi calls it, represents the block-and-defense that Daniel begins to practice diligently. Mr. Miyagi warns him that the powerful technique should only be used as a last resort. Later, Yukie and Mr. Miyagi perform the
   tea ceremony
   together, which, Kumiko explains to Daniel, is a sign that they are renewing their love.

   , has been defrauding the villagers with rigged weights. The outraged farmers set upon Chozen and demand appropriate compensation. Because of this, Chozen accuses Daniel of both insulting his honor and being a coward like his sensei. He and Daniel have a series of confrontations, first in the village, then later in Naha City, and at a 1950s-themed dance. Chozen attempts to humiliate Daniel by demanding he demonstrate his karate skills by chopping through six blocks of ice, a seemingly impossible feat. However, Mr. Miyagi appears just in time to express confidence in Daniel by taking Chozen up on his bet at a dollar amount which Chozen cannot cover, but which Sato agrees to cover Chozen. Daniel successfully fulfills the challenge, which Chozen protests, but Sato informs Chozen not to embarrass Sato and honors the terms of the wager.

   Meanwhile, Daniel and Kumiko begin to grow closer. She brings him to an old castle on the seacoast that Sato is allowing to deteriorate and be plundered. Both Daniel and Kumiko express incredulity at why Sato would allow a historical relic like the castle to suffer thus.

  <p key="8679d0ee-5301-449b-8615-62030b8e4e99">
   The feud between Daniel and Chozen eventually comes to a head when Sato, at the conclusion of the three-day mourning period, shows up to fight Mr. Miyagi. Because Mr. Miyagi is not present, Chozen and his cronies destroy the Miyagi family dojo and much of the garden; then, Chozen viciously attacks Daniel when he tries to intervene. When Mr. Miyagi arrives, Chozen, Taro and Toshio attack him, but Mr. Miyagi defeats them easily, even as Chozen wields a spear. Realizing that he has put Daniel in grave danger, Mr. Miyagi makes plans to return home to Los Angeles.

   Before they can leave Japan, however, Sato shows up with earth-mover machines and threatens to destroy and redevelop the village if Mr. Miyagi continues to refuse to fight. Mr. Miyagi reluctantly gives in, but only on the condition that no matter who wins, Sato must sign the titles to the villagers' homes back over to them. Sato agrees to this condition. On the day the fight is to take place, Daniel and Kumiko, like Yukie and Mr. Miyagi, perform the ancient tea ceremony, ending with a kiss. Meanwhile, a
   typhoon
   strikes the village. The villagers take cover at a storm shelter, but Sato is still at his family's dojo. When the Sato family dojo is leveled by the storm, trapping Sato inside, Mr. Miyagi and Daniel rush to rescue him. Sato believes that Mr. Miyagi has decided to unfairly defeat him while he is incapacitated, but Miyagi instead breaks a support beam that had pinned Sato down, freeing him.

   trapped in the bell tower. Sato orders Chozen to go help Daniel, but Chozen refuses, not wanting to cooperate with Daniel in any capacity. Just as Mr. Miyagi goes on to help Daniel, Sato insists in helping him instead as gratitude for saving his life. After the child is safe, Sato disowns Chozen for refusing to cooperate. Humiliated, Chozen later runs off into the storm in anger.
  </p>
  <p key="ba04ded0-5850-47ca-9fd5-49d4471d7db1">
   The next morning, the villagers set about rebuilding the village, and Sato returns with the bulldozers, not to raze the village, but to help get rid of debris and repair storm damage. Sato hands over the titles to the villagers' homes, and also humbly asks Miyagi for forgiveness. Though Mr. Miyagi insists that there is nothing to forgive, he accepts his old friend's apology. Daniel asks Sato if the village may hold their upcoming
   O-bon
   festival on the castle grounds. Sato agrees, and grants them this right in perpetuity. Sato has one condition, however: that Daniel join him and the other villagers in the celebration. Daniel accepts.

   At the O-bon festival, Kumiko is on stage performing the traditional dance that she rehearsed earlier. However, Daniel notices a figure in yellow and black zip-lining down the lantern installments. When the figure emerges into visibility, it turns out to be a now-deranged and vengeful Chozen, who evilly crashes the festival, seizes Kumiko, holds her hostage at knifepoint (after brandishing a switchblade). Sato tells Chozen that he was wrong to hate Mr. Miyagi and implores Chozen to similarly let go of his hatred for Daniel. But after being disowned, Chozen sees no point in listening to his uncle and refuses, saying that doing so will not give back his "honor" and that he is now "dead" to Sato. Now thirsty for revenge and restoration of his honor, Chozen then threatens to kill Kumiko if Daniel does not step up to fight him to the death. Daniel agrees, in spite of Mr. Miyagi's warning that this time is no tournament, but instead very real. Chozen has turned from a cowardly bully to a hate-filled enemy who indeed wants to kill Daniel.
  </p>
  <p key="0a12235a-a30a-41b7-95e0-011e2b387cb0">
   Daniel fights valiantly, but Daniel gets overwhelmed by Chozen and Chozen proves to be a much more formidable opponent than any other that Daniel has faced before; he even deflects the crane kick Daniel used to win in the tournament. A little while later, Mr. Miyagi brings out his hand drum and beats it. The other villagers follow suit with their own drums, which allows Daniel to realize how he can win. As the puzzled Chozen closes in to attack, the brutally beaten-up Daniel successfully utilizes the drum technique to deflect Chozen's attacks and land a series of devastating counter-attacks. Soon after the final attack, Chozen falls down. Daniel, realizing for the first time in his life that his karate skills are potentially capable of enabling him to kill another person, grabs the vanquished Chozen by his hair and cocks his hand back for the fatal blow, demanding of Chozen,
   <i key="c153b775-1f48-44ef-8a25-14c1e16f434b">
    "Live or die, man!"
   </i>
   When Chozen responds with "die", Daniel counters this and responds the same way Mr. Miyagi did against Kreese; "honking" his nose and dropping him to the ground, unwilling to kill him. Daniel embraces Kumiko, and as Daniel looks up, he sees Mr. Miyagi looking on proudly.
