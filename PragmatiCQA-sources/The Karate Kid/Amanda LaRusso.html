They’re surprised to learn that Kreese filed a restraining order against her after she slapped him. What’s worse is that Kreese came off as more sympathetic due to his war record. Unfortunately, she is unable to file an emergency protective order against Kreese. Then, Amanda goes with a “nuclear option” to her displeasure.

She asked that he doubles the rent and rent the dojo’s space out to a future tenant. Armand requests that the triple be tripled and Amanda explains that she and Daniel are desperate. After giving the deal some thought, Armand agrees to the deal and vows to evict Kreese from the strip mall. The next day, the couple are at work, happy that they won. To their mutual shock, Kreese calls them, their plan failed and now Kreese declares “open season” on them, having planted a live snake at the dealership in response.

As Amanda's first meeting with Johnny is decades after Daniel's encounter, she likely does not know the full story, and dismisses most of it as school hijinks. She also warns Daniel his attitude is spilling over into his professional life. Due to spending so much time at the Miyagi-Do dojo, Daniel has missed multiple business meetings. A key point in friction, but still not yet to a boiling point, comes when Daniel is so fixated on teaching a lesson in a meat locker that he blows off a lunch date with Anoush, one of his best employees. Daniel sees cell phone calls from Amanda and Anoush, but silences them both. When Daniel finally arrives at LaRusso Auto, he is sternly told by Amanda that Anoush has been headhunted away by rival car dealer Tom Cole, and Daniel's no-show at the lunch date was the last straw for Anoush. Amanda warns all this may cost Daniel his business, and ultimately their family's livelihood.

   Amanda is the constant voice of reason in the series. She is a very wise, grounded, and practical person, and can de-escalate conflicts with a few well-chosen words. Little is known about Amanda's background. When talking to Daniel about Sam's new popular friends, she implies having been unpopular at school. It's possible that her parents are either dead or live far away, as when Amanda tells Aisha that Sam is with her grandmother, Daniel immediately knows she is referring to his mother.
