   The LaRusso Auto Dealership first opened in 2002 by

    Daniel

   Amanda LaRusso
   , and they expanded to North Hollywood, Encino, Sherman Oaks, and Woodland Hills. They are known for their low prices and wide variety of cars including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Acura and Porsche. Daniel often used a karate theme as a gag for the dealership, where a TV commercial was shown of Daniel "karate chopping" high prices.

   Through a turn of events, Johnny's
   Pontiac Firebird
   was totaled by an SUV driven by a distracted teenage girl named
   Yasmine
   , who was a friend of
   Daniel's daughter
   . The tow truck driver towed Johnny's car to the nearest autobody shop, which was the service bay of the LaRusso Auto Group. Mortified, Johnny attempted to retrieve his car to take it to a rival dealership, only to be discovered and reunited with Daniel. Daniel convinces Johnny not to take his business elsewhere when he offers to do repairs on the house, claiming a  now-vintage automobile like his would be challenge to the service employees.
