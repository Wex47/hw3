They wanted to teach the world respect and discipline through the ways of karate. Silver, coming from a financially wealthy background, agreed to help Kreese open a dojo they called "Cobra Kai". However, Silver's father wanted him to go into the family business and threatened to cut him out of the inheritance if he disobeyed. This crushed Kreese, who didn't think he could open the dojo without Silver there to teach as a co-sensei. Silver promised to be there for him someday, but that day couldn't be now.

Shocked by his behavior, Daniel apologizes to Mr. Miyagi and Jessica and tells Silver at the Cobra Kai dojo that he will not fight at the tournament. However, Silver reveals his true agenda to Daniel when he asks Barnes and Kreese to enter the room. After Barnes viciously assaults Daniel, Mr. Miyagi arrives and defeats the three men. Daniel decides to fight at the tournament and Mr. Miyagi trains him.

Prior to the finals, Silver instructs Barnes to commit illegal strikes against Daniel, which will prolong the fight and make Daniel suffer and feel pain, before eventually beating him at the sudden death round. Barnes does so, and Daniel is afraid of him and cannot continue, but Mr. Miyagi encourages him to continue. In the sudden death round, Daniel does the kata that Mr. Miyagi taught him. When a confused Barnes attacks, Daniel flips him into the ground to win the tournament for the second straight year. Disgusted and humiliated, Silver walks away from a stunned Kreese and Barnes, while the crowd throws the t-shirts back to them; Cobra Kai was shut down for good (or so it seemed).

Daniel, who is now a rich auto dealer, influences the landlord to double the rent just to close down the dojo. Johnny has a tough time searching for more students. However, Miguel eventually helps him get more students when he demonstrates Johnny's teachings against a group of school bullies. However, the students that come to the dojo aren't what Johnny expected and he begins insulting them. Because of this, they end up quitting including Demetri and Eli Moskowitz, who would end up becoming Hawk and returns to the dojo.

   Johnny learns that Cobra Kai was banned from the All-Valley Tournament in 1985 following the events of The Karate Kid Part III, which Johnny was unaware of as he had quit Cobra Kai about one year prior. Johnny convinces the committee minus Daniel and one other to reinstate Cobra Kai. Miguel manages to win the tournament for Cobra Kai. However, Johnny feels bad about how he taught his students to use illegal moves and no mercy fighting to win the tournament, as well as making Miguel and the rest of students bigger bullies than he was originally taught to be, reflecting on his own time in  the dojo.

   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="25e71dc9-c369-4a2b-8776-bcaa068a9dd8">

  <p key="749b3864-b519-4343-8677-2a08040d275e">
   <i key="220c339c-8d57-4100-ae2b-907708faa71e">

   These methods included punching practice and physical fitness training. The latter of which, is used more as a punishment. Kreese's favored method is push-ups on the knuckles. On top of physical training, Kreese's philosophy is to win at all costs. Whether it's injuring an opponent, or exploiting said injury. A notion only two students disagreed with.

While not emphasizing the Miyagi family's attitude of "Karate for defense only", he has also discarded Kreese's cruelty. Lawrence seems to promote the concept "the best defense is a good offense", but also warns students that certain moves could result in severe bodily injury and are only to be used in extreme scenarios.

Demonstrating the lesson. To never wait for the enemy to attack.  The Cobra Kai teacher then teaches the meaning of Strike First: That to strike first, you must know how to strike.  To demonstrate he brings out a Body Opponent Bag or B.O.B. to demonstrate both the strike and the vital areas. The strike, known as the Cobra Strike, is comprised of two components. The lunge, which incorporates the whole body strength. As well as the bite, which ends with the fist. To punch, you don't just end at the surface, you have to punch through your opponent as though you are trying to hit the person behind them. For better motivation, the Cobra Kai teacher tells his student to imagine their enemy.

   Borrowed from Kreese. The push ups are less of a punishment and more standard training.  Designed to increase the student's arm strength.  However it still can be used as a punishment as demonstrated when Miguel walked in on Johnny and Daniel's confrontation and asked if he needed to do them as punishment for interrupting.  They are later incorporated as such, when Johnny dresses down Miguel and Hawk, for fighting dirty in the tournament. Should you fail to do so on your first try, The Cobra Kai teacher compensates by telling his student to do alternatives such as Crunches. However, eventually, the student will master the push ups.

   To do this, the Cobra Kai teacher must take their student to a body of water. Be it a swimming pool or a lake. Whichever has a deep point. The student is then fitted with a rope around their hands to restrain them and told that to kick they need to increase the strength of their legs. Without warning, the Cobra Kai teacher pushes the student into the water and tells them to kick up with their legs. When they manage to stay afloat for 10 minutes that's when the next half of the lesson is taught. To demonstrate the kick strength, the student must learn how to front kick on a series of boards, representing the vital areas of an opponent, such as the kneecaps, stomach and face.

   When the Cobra Kai teacher, feels that the student is ready, they will personally spar with them. When you defeat them, that's when you've learned. However, don't underestimate them just because they are on the ground, for they may have a friend that will strike you from behind. In the teacher's case, the remote to the ball launcher.

   According to Sensei Lawrence, real bullying is done to your face. With honor and the guts to back it up. That those who use anonymous accounts to bully and harass people are a bunch of spineless losers. And that to truly fight bullying one must send a message, not with your keyboard, but with your fist.

   The training prior to this while it can apply to a group, has more or less been applied to one student. Whereas here, when more students show up the most trained one must test their skills against the newer one.  As demonstrated when Miguel strikes Aisha. The newer one is required to in turn retaliate as best they can. As demonstrated when Aisha in turn overpowers Miguel. Once the demonstration is over, the new Cobra is required to train in the same way the trained Cobra is trained.

Incorporate the lessons you've been taught prior and once successful, the Cobra Kai teacher will award you with your very own Gi. The Gi comes in two variations: Student White. The standard amongst Karate students. Tournament Black: The standard formal wear for competitive fighting.

   Presumably the result of Challenge 1, would up the students' reputation and would cause many potentials to show up.  However, since there are so many in the start, it requires the Cobra Kai teacher to be more harsh. This lesson is required, because in real life no one cares about boundaries, laws and rules and would do anything to provoke or dominate you. Those that understand, stay and train. Those that don't, leave. Those that disagree will be used as an example and most likely thrown to the floor.

   This is more of a confidence booster rather than actual training.  If the student has a physical deformity, a mental disorder or just downright has social problems. They are required to take those problems and turn them into feats of strength. Case in point Eli "Hawk" Moskowitz.  When he started out, he was insecure about his cleft palate even when corrective surgery is applied. As a result, he barely spoke and was also implied to be on the autistic spectrum. After a few words from Johnny, he changed his look and attitude.  Donned a mohawk and tattoo and became a berserker similar to that of Dutch.

But I haven't taught you the third rule of Cobra Kai: No Mercy. The older you get, the more you're gonna learn, that life isn't fair. You wake up one morning feeling great and then life throws a spinning heel kick to your balls and takes a big steaming shit in your mouth. You get an F on a test. You get suspended. You fall in love with a girl, then some other dude comes and steals her away. Your car gets set on fire. Just when you think things are going good, everything falls apart. That's how it goes. Life shows No Mercy. So neither do we. We do whatever it takes to keep our heads above water.  We do whatever it takes to keep moving forward. We do whatever it takes to win. Remember who you are. You're badass. You don't give a shit. You kick ass!! You're Cobra Kai. "

   Following the tournament, Sensei Johnny Lawrence realized that without restraint, he inadvertently turned the students into the very people he and his fellow students used to be in 1984. So he implemented a lesson in an attempt to reign it in.  He was specifically mad, that Miguel and Hawk resorted to illegal tactics to win. To prove his point he asks the following:

   The correct answer is the Lion. For a Cobra is most badass when they beat the animal at its strongest.  Not when their back is turned, not when they are injured.  Failure to comply to the new rule, will cause the offenders 50 pushups on your knuckles. As well as the rest of the class, to be reduced to white belts to further motivate them.

   As further punishment, both for the events of the tournament and for arrogance; the Cobra Kai Students are required to go to a remote location and mix cement until it is ready. Johnny then brought out a cement mixing truck to pour the cement inside. Once it's good enough for the students to be up to their knees inside, they are required to step into the mixer and push it manually like a treadmill. Combining their strengths to keep the cement going lest they be stuck. Once they mastered this training, they will be hosed down and fit for another training session.

   This is less of a training exercise and more of a punishment. While Miyagi-Do is considered an enemy of Cobra Kai, the Cobra Kai teacher will not tolerate petty retaliation. In one instance the teacher was accused of vandalizing Miyagi-Do Dojo, the teacher had no knowledge of such an event and in an effort to get a student to fess up, the entire school was forced into a rigorous set of training. This includes but not limits to Squat Thrusts. While a punishment it also tests the will of the students. However another Cobra Kai teacher, has twisted it, in an effort to test the loyalty and conviction, similar to that of Spartacus. First by pointing out one student responsible, then holding the rest responsible for his/her actions.

The goal is to find spots to hide and then seek out the opposing team. Then steal their headbands off them by any means necessary.  Whichever team gets the most headbands wins the challenge.
