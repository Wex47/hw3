   The Good, The Bad, and The Badass
   .  She is an elected member of the NorthRidge City Council and serves as it's senior member or president.  Earlier, she informs the All Valley Karate Tournament of the intent for the city to cancel their permit for the upcoming 2019 All Valley Karate Tournament, due to the continuing lingering tensions that came from the brawl at West Valley High School.  She would hold an open hearing for the Northridge City Council, and her hearing would be attended by all three of the sensei's, as well as many of their students.  During the hearings she hears testimony from John Kreese, Daniel LaRusso, and Johnny Lawrence.  She also orders Amanda LaRusso to be removed from the chamber when she is informed that John Kreese has a legal restraining order preventing her from being within 100 feet of him.  She seemed to be heading to keep the ban in place, but is swayed otherwise by an impassioned set of speeches by Samantha LaRusso and Miguel Diaz.

   Hawk
   ,
   Tory,
   Robby,
   Kyler
   , and another unnamed Cobra Kai student are attempting to steal a snake from the local zoo, to carry out the task that

   had put them up to do. Paul and the unnamed Cobra Kai stood guard while the others went to get the snake, but they weren't able to due to Kyler forgetting the Snake Pole.  However, the crew ended up being successful thanks to Robby snatching the snakes without any equipment. While Eagle Fang and Miyagi-Do were trying to plan for their dojo's to merge, the two dojo's were interrupted by Cobra Kai with Paul included. First, he was fighting Stiven with Hawk, but went to fight
   Sam
   after.  He fought Sam for a bit, but was defeated.  When Hawk realized he is fighting on the wrong side, Paul was beating Mitch and kicking him to the ground.  Then, he faced off against
   Demetri
   and Hawk with
   Mikey
   and an unnamed Cobra Kai student due to Hawk defecting, but they were quickly defeated. It can be assumed that Paul is still loyal to John Kreese, just like many other Cobra Kai Students.

I’m the guy—” However, it backfires on him as Stacy interrupts and embarrasses him in front of Bert and Mitch by saying, “Who wets the bed and got kicked into that trophy case? Yeah, we know.” Mitch and Bert started laughing at the roast Hawk receives.

   students walking through the door with Sam and Miguel suggesting that the two dojos work together.  While Stiven along with the others sans
   Miguel
   and Sam don't agree with this, they soon come to a truce. Then, several Cobra Kai's break in, resulting in a fight breaking out.  Stiven was fighting both Hawk and Paul before Paul went to fight Sam.  Stiven was able to put a few hits on Hawk, but Hawk was still winning the fight.  Stiven then attempted to fight
   Tory
   , but was quickly defeated.  Stiven then continued to fight Hawk, but was thrown to the ground by the stronger foe. Stiven and his friends ultimately win the fight, partly due to Hawk defecting and helping his side. In the last scene of the season finale, he is shown at Miyagi-Do with the Miyagi-Do and
