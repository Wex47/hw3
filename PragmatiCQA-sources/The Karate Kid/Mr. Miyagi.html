   After Pearl Harbor was bombed in 1941, the US officially announced formal entry into World War II. At first, Japanese and Nisei citizens were discouraged from volunteering, and those already in active service were demoted to reserve units over fears of sabotage.

   In January 1943, the United States army issued a call for Japanese-American volunteers. Mr. Miyagi was probably not among the initial recruits being that he was attending college that year even though most of whom came from Hawaii, as those on the mainland were reluctant to volunteer while their families remained in internment camps. It is most likely that he got drafted early the following year in 1944. For fear of espionage due to the Japanese lineage of the solders, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team was sent to the European theater, Stationed primarily in Italy and fought the Battle of Anzio. While Mr. Miyagi was in the war, his wife, who was pregnant, was held at the Manzanar internment camp.

   Over the course of his military service, Mr. Miyagi was promoted to the rank of Staff Sergeant and was highly decorated. Mr. Miyagi's unit was the 442nd Infantry Regiment, one of the most highly decorated regiments in the history of the United States Armed Forces, including 21 Medal of Honor recipients. Mr. Miyagi was one of them, having earned not only the Medal of Honor, but also the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Army Commendation Medal, Purple Heart, Presidential Unit Citation, Army Good Conduct Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team Service Identification Badge.

   Sadly, while he was away in the war, Mr. Miyagi suffered the greatest personal tragedy of his life. His wife and their son passed away in Manzar on November 2, 1944 due to complications during childbirth when there were no doctors there to help. This was a loss that haunted him for decades, and he never remarried or had children, living a relatively solitary existence.

Daniel however is frustrated that Mr. Miyagi is making him doing chores instead of teaching him Karate. Daniel eventually confronts Mr. Miyagi, who in turn tells him to show him the motions he'd been using to do the chores. After doing so, Daniel realizes that all the chores Mr. Miyagi has made him do are really defense tactics, reflex and muscle building activities. Mr. Miyagi then attacks Daniel who counters all his strikes.

   A true martial arts master, Mr. Miyagi possesses extraordinary skill. Primarily a counter-fighter, his ability to read an opponent's intentions is exceptional. He often waits for his opponent to attack, then dodges with one quick, economical motion that positions him perfectly for a decisive counter. Mr. Miyagi never wastes movement; whether on offense or defense his techniques achieve maximum results with minimum effort. Aside from the standard strikes his

Mr. Miyagi often uses his opponents' body weight and offense against them, and the core of his karate is defensive-minded. It takes a lot of balance and technique to do this properly, but in Mr. Miyagi's hands this style is much more effective than any aggressive one. Daniel also seems to be at his best when he follows his mentor's example; he defeats the abusive and physically dominant

   where Terry apologizes to Mr. Miyagi for Kreese's actions in the aftermath of the 1984 All Valley Tournament, as well as tells him that Kreese has died, though Mr. Miyagi is unaware that Terry is lying and that this lie is part of his plot to get revenge on Daniel and Mr. Miyagi for running Kreese's life following the 1984 All Valley. Later, when Terry, Kreese and Mike are harassing Daniel, Mr. Miyagi shows up. He first defeats Mike and then Kreese. After beating Kreese, Terry mocks his karate and attacks him, only to be easily defeated. After defeating him, Mr. Miyagi mocks him. Furious over the mockery, Terry angrily tells him this isn't over and that he will be opening a chain of Cobra Kai dojos in other places in the neighborhood. However, Terry's plot fails as Mr. Miyagi helps Daniel defeat Mike in the sudden death round of the All Valley, to win the title for the second consecutive year.

   Julie is the granddaughter of Mr. Miyagi's deceased friend Jack. Their relationship goes on to be like a father-daughter relationship. When Mr. Miyagi first meets Julie, she is cold and rude to him. However, when Mr. Miyagi takes Julie to a Buddhist monastery to teach her the true ways of karate and how to handle her anger issues, Julie learns to calm down, and develop a close relationship with Mr. Miyagi. Their bonding continues after returning from the monastery, as Mr. Miyagi assists Julie in releasing Angel, the pigeon she was taking care of, to fly freely above water, teaches her to dance and buys her a prom for her school prom. Later when Julie is fighting Ned, Mr. Miyagi tells her to concentrate, which helps her defeat him. After Mr. Miyagi defeats Paul, the two walk off together.

   There is some debate as to what exactly Mr. Miyagi's first name is, since it varies depending on the source consulted. His name is never mentioned once in the first three Karate Kid films, as he is only referred to as "Mr. Miyagi". It has been implied that "Miyagi" may be his first name. This would seem to fit since Mr. Miyagi frequently refers to himself in the third person as simply "Miyagi". Also, in the
