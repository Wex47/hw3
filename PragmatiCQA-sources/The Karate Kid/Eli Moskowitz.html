   At first Eli is quiet, shy, and often made fun of for his scar that is the result of a cleft lip surgery. They are at lunch when the new-kid
   Miguel

Johnny uses a takedown on Demetri, flipping him, before telling Eli that he has to do the same. Flip the script on those who want to attack him. If he's tired of people mocking the scar he has to give them something else to look at or react too. Demetri storms out of the dojo, though Eli stays, inspired by Johnny's teachings. He takes the message to heart and returns to class the next day donning a large mohawk and a hawk tattoo on his back. This changes his nickname from "Lip" to "Hawk".

   . The pair are evenly matched, but when Robby scores a point on Hawk, the dynamic shifts. Hawk taunts Robbym and in response, Robby mocks Hawk's mohawk. This infuriates Hawk and causes him to kick Robby from behind in the shoulder, thus dislocating it and causing a disqualification from the tournament. Following his disqualification, an upset Johnny questions Hawk's actions, though he defensively repeats the "strike first, no mercy" motto of Cobra Kai. After Miguel wins the tournament for Cobra Kai, Hawk and the others cheer for their fellow teammate, though Johnny isn't pleased with the events.

   After some time, Miguel finds out that Robby is Johnny's son and he tells Hawk, causing them both to believe the only reason Johnny is being hard on them because they attacked his son. When they confront Johnny, an angry Johnny tells them that despite Robby being his son, his anger was not about that; he doesn't tolerate unethical behavior. He also tells them to mind their own business.

   Over the course of the season, Hawk becomes more recognizably a bully, intimidating and insulting new students of the dojo and bullying Demetri after the latter writes a bad review about Cobra Kai. When Demetri is at the comic store in the mall, Hawk and some of his fellow Cobra Kai classmates corner him, and Hawk threatens Demetri, trying to force him to take down his

   Samantha
   arrive. Hawk and his gang fight them, but Hawk is beaten by Robby, and the rest of the gang is bested as well. Later, Hawk's behavior has even more repercussions as Moon, his girlfriend, points out to Hawk that she likes his new attitude and style, but not his bullying, and so she dumps him. Furious over the breakup, Hawk takes his anger out on a punching bag. Johnny's sensei,

Hawk is ready to come clean, but Kreese secretly tells him not to. Later during one of their training exercises, Miguel notices Hawk with the Medal of Honor and realizes Hawk is the one who destroyed Daniel's dojo. Miguel confronts Hawk, who then challenges Miguel to fight him for it. Despite putting up a good fight, Hawk is defeated by Miguel.  Miguel then takes the Medal of Honor and later brings it to the LaRusso house. Although he wanted to give it to Sam, Robby is there, so he gives it to Robby and explains that he had no part in the destruction of Miyagi-Do. Surprisingly, Hawk is not angry at Miguel after this fight and the loss, sensing that the fight was fair.

Later at the party, Demetri gets revenge by telling a large group of the party-goers embarrassing stories about Hawk. An enraged Hawk tries to attack him alongside the rest of Cobra Kai, but they're stopped by the rest of Miyagi-Dos. Just as a fight is about to break out, the cops arrive. Before leaving the scene, Hawk runs into Demetri and threateningly reminds him they'll see each other the next day at school.

   In one of the first training exercises with the new dojo master, Kreese, the students are supposed to say whether they are uncomfortable feeding a mouse to a snake. Hawk is among the handful that don't raise their hands, but he is surprised and uncomfortable when Kreese dismisses the students who objected, kicking them out of Cobra Kai, including Bert. Hawk asks Kreese if this is the right time to make cuts, since they already lost a few students as a result of the school fight, but Kreese sees this display of possible compassion as a weakness, which Hawk is quick to deny. Kreese then says that Cobra Kai needs a new champion due to Miguel's injury. This causes Hawk to smile, realizing that Kreese is talking about him.

   After finding out that the Miyagi-Do students are hosting a fundraiser for Miguel's surgery, Hawk sees this as an affront against Cobra Kai and vows they won't get away with this. At the end of the day and Miyagi-Do's successful fundraiser, Hawk, Mitch and two other Cobra Kai students corner
   Nathaniel
   , who was responsible for the transporting the donations for Miguel's surgery, beat him up and take the money. Mitch does say they plan on giving it to Miguel's family themselves.

   The rivalry between Cobra Kai and Miyagi-Do, largely sustained by Hawk, continues at school. Hawk destroys Demetri's science project, but Demetri cannot retaliate due to the new anti-fighting policies at the school. Hawk gets his friends out of trouble by acting as Eli. Recognizing this, the two dojos find other ways of acting out their rivalry. During a gym class soccer game, the Miyagi-Dos and Cobra Kais get physical, with Demetri pushing and leg sweeping Hawk as revenge, and Hawk getting back by headbutting Demetri. Hawk also kicks the soccer ball at a Miyagi-Do student's face. When the game is interrupted and both sides are sent to the counselor's office for disciplining, Hawk (who was allowed to tell their side first) gets himself and his friends off without punishment by turning into Eli with a (fake) docile and apologetic demeanor, while Sam, Demetri, and the other Miyagi Dos involved get detention.

After momentarily hesitating, Hawk breaks Demetri's arm, but shows some discomfort as Demetri screams in pain, showing remorse for taking this out of hand with his former best friend.

   The following morning before class at the Cobra Kai dojo, Hawk shows some uneasiness when Mitch brags about Hawk breaking Demetri's arm, but to not show this, he claims that Miyagi-Do got what they deserved. He is unhappy and nervous after noticing his former bullies Kyler and

   joining Cobra Kai. He tries to convince Kreese that they aren't Cobra Kai material. Kreese deflects this by pointing out how they are natural athletes. When Kyler and Brucks encounter Hawk, they make fun of him, much like old times, which visibly causes Hawk to shrink into himself a bit and his two selves, former Eli and present Hawk, are conflicted. When Mitch loses to Kyler in the sparing match that Kreese has arranged to determine who belongs in Cobra Kai, Kreese kicks him out of the dojo. Hawk objects, pointing out how loyal Mitch has been, but Kreese says that Mitch isn't Cobra Kai material despite his loyalty. This visibly saddens Hawk. When it is Brucks' turn to fight, Hawk says he will fight him, and Kreese, seeing Hawk's taste for revenge, indicates the match won't run by the normal, fair rules of competition. Brucks mockingly says he will fix Hawk's lip, but Hawk lets him see his hawk tattoo and shows he is unbothered, as Brucks and Kyler become uneasy. Hawk then aggressively, easily beats Bruck in competition and doesn't stop even when Brucks is already on the ground and begs him to. It seems that Hawk uses the opportunity to let out the pent-up emotions of his past bullying. In the end of the fight, Brucks is groaning in pain, while Hawk gets up with a satisfied look, and blood on his hands. Hawk glares at Kyler after beating Brucks, with the latter looking away, proving that Kyler is scared of Hawk from this moment. Hawk also indicates that this is what could also happen to Kyler if he messes with Hawk.

   After Miguel returns to school, Hawk greets him and things seem to continue like before. However, their friend group dynamics are changed as Hawk is quick to mock Mitch when they meet in the cafeteria, and tells him to sit at the loser's table. Then, Hawk is confronted by Miguel for breaking Demetri's arm and going against their sensei. Hawk argues that Johnny is the one who betrayed them, and that he is no longer their sensei. This upsets Miguel, who tells Hawk he is letting Kreese take over his mind. Hawk is then shocked to learn from Miguel that Johnny has started a new dojo, which Miguel tries to persuade Hawk to join. When Johnny shows up at school later that day, he approaches Hawk and some of the Cobra Kais, and he acknowledges his mistakes. However, Hawk criticizes Johnny for quitting and going soft on them, which causes an angry Johnny to remind Hawk that he, not Kreese, is the reason that Hawk went from being a weakling to a tough guy. He then tells them that Kreese doesn't care about them, and that they should come to his dojo tomorrow.

   The following morning, when Johnny's students are training, Hawk shows up with the other Cobra Kais. After initially thinking they are going to join Johnny's new dojo, Kreese also appears and Hawk reminds Johnny that he is Cobra Kai for life. Things are tense for a moment until the Cobra Kais leave, but this is where it becomes clear that Hawk's and Miguel's friendship is over for the time being. However, Hawk still seems to care about Miguel, since he is upset to find out that Robby has joined Cobra Kai, which is problematic because of what he did to Miguel. He then tells Kreese to not allow Robby a place in Cobra Kai after the incident with Miguel at the high school and that Robby is “the enemy”. Rather than kick Robby out of Cobra Kai, Kreese responds by telling Hawk that during his time in the military, “it was hard to tell who was the enemy” but that he figured out that, “The enemy of your enemy is your friend”. By this statement, Kreese means to say that Hawk can be Robby's friend since both are enemies of Miguel. However, since Hawk does not really feel that Miguel is his enemy, it actually means that they are still friends in both being Robby's enemy.

   Despite their disagreements, Hawk wants to please Kreese as the new sensei, and so he, along with some of the Cobra Kais, sets up a plan to sneak into the zoo and steal a snake for Kreese. When Robby arrives, Hawk is angry that he was invited by Tory, but Tory challenges Hawk having a problem with Robby being on the mission. When Hawk aborts the mission because Kyler forgot the snake pole, Robby ends up getting the snake with his bare hands. Despite the mission being successful, Hawk is still not pleased about Robby being on their team. That night after bringing the snake, Kreese reveals to them all that Miguel and Sam are now working together. He then orders the members to go and attack the Eagle Fangs/Miyagi-Dos, causing Hawk to be reluctant about joining the mission with Kyler.

   . While Stiven puts up a fight and gets some hits, Hawk has the upper-hand overall and beats him. Cobra Kai is winning the fight but after noticing Miguel, Mitch and the other Miyagi Do students being beaten up by the other Cobra Kai students, he is visibly conflicted, remembering what Johnny and Miguel said at school, and also remembering what Kreese said about enemies. After this, he sees
   Doug
   holding Demetri's arm in a deja vu moment. Doug encourages him to break his arm a second time. Hawk runs up, but knocks down both Doug and the other Cobra Kai, switches sides during the fight and saves Demetri. After saving him, Demetri is reluctant to trust Hawk but he apologizes to him for everything, resulting in their friendship being rekindled. The two then work together to defeat several Cobra Kais. Hawk's defection proves to be the turning point in the fight, as the Miyagi Do's and Eagle Fang's gain momentum and the edge, and ultimately defeat the Cobra Kai's.

   After defeating the Cobra Kais in Sam's house, Hawk heads to Daniel's home dojo by the pool along with Miguel and Demetri, where they see Tory, who was just disarmed by Sam. Hawk tells Tory the fight is over, but she refuses to believe it's over. She leaves, but not before telling Hawk to watch his back. Demetri promises that Hawk's friends will watch it for him. The following morning, the last scene of this season shows Hawk going with some of the other former Cobra Kai's to Miyagi-Do, where he high-fives Demetri, and trains with the Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang students under Johnny and Daniel's leadership.

   Hawk has rekindled friendship with Demetri and hopes to attone for the mistakes he's made while at Cobra Kai. However, he struggles to find his place in the combined dojos. The Eagle Fang's see him as a traitor while the Miyagi-Do's seek to punish him for the torment he put them through. He confides in Daniel about his problems, unaware that Daniel is already angered from an argument with Johnny. Daniel snaps that he doesn't have time for Hawk, causing the boy to walk away.

   Eli is initially portrayed as a very quiet and introverted individual due to the intense bullying he's endured his entire life for a medical condition that he can't control. He was made to feel less than others and, as such, had a low self-worth. Despite mocking the popular kids at school, Eli desired to be one of them. He wanted to be respected by his peers, but coupled respect with having to exude fear and intimidation. Searching for a way to protect himself against the intense bullying, and also searching for a sense of comradery with Miguel, Eli joins

   . His first lesson from Johnny is to minimize the significance of the facial difference by "flipping the script" so people have notice something else first. Knowing this will allow him to control the narrative for once, Eli adopts a new hairstyle in the form of a mowhawk. He takes it to the next level by getting a giant hawk tattoo on his back. This, coupled with his new attitude of cockiness, gives him the new name "Hawk".
  </p>
  <p key="daa1a98e-5eef-453b-a6b1-22ae126ce20a">
   Now in control of his life and getting the spotlight for the first time, Hawk develops an inflated ego. He becomes more self-assured, willing to take risks. With this comes and overconfidence, aggressive, and hot headed nature. His sense of right and wrong is blurred as he devotes blind loyalty to Johnny, and later Kreese, following their rules and creed to the letter. He fails to adapt when Johnny tries to teach his students morals, as Hawk now views any diversion from the initial Cobra Kai mantra as weakness. Hawk begins to bully his Demetri to maintain the identity he found in Cobra Kai. He becomes thuggish, cruel, and vengeful in his approach toward life. He goes from being the abused to the abuser. He turns his pain into anger at every turn. He develops a sexist attitude towards women and a cockiness in his relationship that causes Moon to leave him. Hawk's loyalties shift from Johnny to Kreese when the latter takes over the dojo. He blames Johnny for Miguel's accident, but also views Cobra Kai as his identity and sense of self. He is desperate to maintain that at any cost.

  <p key="1bdbbc5c-0ec2-4fbc-8d11-794b03db6f00">
   As time passes, Hawk begins to reconnect with is conscience as he realizes that Kreese's cruel methods are unhealthy. However, his weakened sense of self and inability to stand up to Cobra Kai results in the dojo peer-pressuring Hawk into breaking Demetri's arm during a fight. Eventually, Hawk's conscience peaks and he realizes the error of his ways during the heated LaRusso house brawl. Something in his mind clicks into place as he realizes the ramifications of his actions and the merciless mindset of the kids around him. He, for the first time in over a year, does the right thing by freeing Demetri from an arm lock and helping him. This allows him to break away from Cobra Kai and enter a healthier mindset. He does his best to make things right with those he hurt, and is a main factor in "building bridges" between Eagle Fang and Miyagi-Do. When

  <p key="5facb192-62f2-421d-b8b3-1672ab8448c2">
   Once he enters training, Hawk develops into an aggressive fighter with a penchant for high-risk techniques. Light and wiry, he is something of a natural athlete. He does demonstrate a solid defense when pressed, weathering an intense combination from Robby only to counter with a well-timed take-down. However, when Robby starts focusing, he counters Hawk's strikes and knocks him down with perfect timing.
  </p>
  <p key="3f2f26a6-9e39-4cf4-a9e9-007b02c7c87a">
   Hawk's style becomes even flashier and more reckless, incorporating aerial kicks and other high risk moves. However, over-reliance on offense is of limited utility when he is facing opponents with solid defensive technique. Robby, Miguel and Demetri are all able to defeat him with superior timing and defense. Hawk also had a tendency to underestimate everyone except Miguel. Despite losing in multiple fights, he is still able to defeat many people, such as most of his Cobra Kai peers at Coyote Creek, as well as several Miyagi-Do students during the school brawl.
  </p>
  <p key="2fb60fee-00ad-4814-bd97-0637c3cdca58">
   Hawk's fighting style is improving after being advised by Kreese to fight smart. Hawk tempers his aggression and fights smarter and less impulsively, which visibly improve his fighting style. His timing has improved. While he still uses his high risk techniques, he relies less on them and implements them more intelligently. He also stops underestimating his opponents, which makes his fighting style even more effective. After teaming up with Demetri during the fight at Sam's house, the two manage to combine their skills to defeat several Cobra Kai's, making them a complimentary duo.

   When fighting Demetri in the school brawl at the end of season 2, Hawk initially gained the upper hand with his aggressive style, but then proceeded to lose when Demetri used his defensive tactics he learned at Miyagi Do to counter all of Hawk's strikes, before kicking him into the trophy case. Their fight can indicate that Hawk's over reliance of offense isn't effective, when facing opponents who have superior defense and technique, even if they are physically weaker and have less experience. However, it is also possible that Hawk was caught off-guard with Demetri's sudden improvement. In the arcade fight, Hawk successfully and easily pinned Demetri to the ground by fighting less aggressive and being more focused.

  <p key="6d06d12e-dc79-4d6a-934b-494296aecad8">
   Hawk's physical strength has also improved, as he can easily pin a much larger and bigger Brucks to the ground. He killed two birds with one stone when he kicked another Cobra Kai and threw a larger Doug into a glass table with little effort, with the latter being a powerful Cobra Kai fighter; however, Doug was caught off-guard by Hawk switching sides, as he thought Hawk was going to break Demetri's arm a second time.

   Demetri is Hawk's brother figure. They were best friends before Cobra Kai due to their similar interests shared popularity status. They become friends with Miguel and join Cobra Kai together, though Demetri quits after being embarrassed by Johnny. Despite quitting, the two are still friends. In the All Valley tournament, Demetri is seen cheering on his best friend, though he is shocked to see how Hawk fights Robby and his subsequent disqualification.

  <p key="35fd073f-406a-4772-92ff-bbda8c78f043">
   Their friendship becomes strained when Demetri complains to Hawk about being hit by Kreese, and Hawk insults him and shows no sympathy. After Demetri leaves Cobra Kai and joins Miyagi-Do, their friendship comes to an end, especially after Demetri writes a bad review about Cobra Kai and refuses to take it down. As a result, Hawk attacks him in the mall along with some of his Cobra Kai friends. Despite all of this, Demetri attempts to rekindle the friendship with Hawk at Moon's party, but this backfires. The following morning during the school brawl, Hawk attempts to get revenge by chasing Demetri across the school and attacking him, but is defeated in the end when the latter uses his Miyagi-Do tactics to counter all of his strikes, before kicking Hawk into a trophy case.

   Their rivalry continues through season 3. In school, Hawk ruins Demetri's science project as a way to try and impress his ex-girlfriend Moon, they fight through dirty tactics in gym class, and ultimately cannot come to terms while at school.  At the arcade fight between Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai, Hawk breaks Demetri's arm after being pressured by his Cobra Kai peers, but he was initially hesitant to do so. When Demetri screams in pain and is crying after Hawk breaks his arm, Hawk has some concern and remorse. As the days go by following the arcade fight, Hawk's conscience slowly begins to return, and he begins to show increasing signs of remorse over his behavior towards his former best friend. Despite Cobra Kai gaining the upper hand in the LaRusso house fight, Hawk ultimately realizes he is on the wrong side and his corruption turned him into a ruthless person ever since he joined Cobra Kai. After he sees Doug put Demetri in a lock, he defects from Cobra Kai, saves him, apologizing to him, and reconciling his friendship with him. The two fight together against the Cobra Kai students and in the end, Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang win. Both of them alongside Miguel stop Tory and Sam from fighting. Demetri defends Hawk by telling Tory that he has friends who will watch him. The following morning, the two share a handshake and a hug, as they stand together when Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang begin training together.

Eli joins Cobra Kai after witnessing Miguel using his skills from Cobra Kai training to beat up Kyler and his gang. After becoming Hawk, Eli would go on to become one of the top students along with Miguel. Despite Hawk's abrasive personality and actions, as well as the two getting into a fight over Mr. Miyagi's Medal of Honor that Hawk stole, they remain close friends. After Miguel goes over the railing as a result of Robby kicking him, Hawk is one of the first to the scene of him lying unconscious on the steps. Hawk tries to wake Miguel up, but a cop tells him to back away.

   In season 3, Hawk is one of Miguel's regular visitors in the hospital. Hawk is also intent on getting revenge on Miyagi-Do for what he feels they did to Miguel, and he does things like steal the fundraised money for Miguel's surgery to make it look like it came from Cobra Kai's efforts. When Miguel returns to school, Hawk is happy to see him. Things quickly sour when Miguel finds out how Demetri's arm got broken by Hawk. Miguel immediately confronts Hawk about this, but Hawk tells him that he should be thankful to Cobra Kai for avenging what Miyagi-Do did to him. Miguel can't understand Hawk's motivations and corrects Hawk that it isn't Johnny's fault, but Hawk responds back saying that Johnny isn't his sensei. Miguel warns Hawk about Kreese getting inside his head and tries to persuade Hawk to join Johnny's new karate dojo. Miguel and Hawk see each other later at the park, but when all the Cobra Kais and Kreese arrive, Hawk reveals he is still loyal to Cobra Kai. When Johnny refuses to go back to Cobra Kai Dojo, it seems Hawk and Miguel are about to fight each other, but they are stopped by their senseis. Following the park scene, it is evident that their friendship is over.

   Despite their friendship ending, it can be very likely that Hawk is still supportive of Miguel, as when Robby joins Cobra Kai, Hawk is furious because of what he did to Miguel during the school karate war and Hawk attempts to fight Robby, to avenge Miguel's injuries. During the fight at Sam's house, Hawk witnesses his own best friend Miguel getting beaten up by his Cobra Kai peers and feels ashamed of seeing his friends Miguel, Demetri, Bert and Mitch getting beaten up by Cobra Kai, while also remembering Miguel telling him about Kreese getting inside his head and how his corruption made him who he is; this is one of the reasons that prompts Hawk to defect from Cobra Kai and transfer to Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang. Hawk's friendship with Miguel is also restored after switching sides during the fight at Sam's house. Thanks to Hawk's betrayal and their reconciliation, Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang win. Together, Miguel and Hawk alongside Demetri manage to stop Tory and Sam from continuing their fight.

   Moon is Hawk's former bully and ex-girlfriend. Moon and Yasmine, along with Kyler and Brucks, have been making fun of Eli's lip for years. When Eli turned into "Hawk," and got his mohawk, their relationship changed. They do get along at Yasmine's interrupted lake party, where they make out. In season 2, Moon dumps Hawk for threatening to beat up Demetri, as she, too, has changed and rejects bullying. This upsets Hawk. Later in the season at Moon's party, Hawk attempts to flirt with

    to make his ex jealous. To his surprise, Moon then kisses the new girl, Piper, revealing that they are together. Hawk tells her that this is "awesome", covering his jealousy. However, this likely causes him to lash out at Demetri later. During the soccer game in season 3, Hawk attempts to wink at Moon, indicating that he still has feelings for her, but she rolls her eyes at him. He covers the tattoo of her name and shape of the moon that he got for her with a grim reaper tattoo, indicating that he is over her.

However, when Hawk is disqualified in the semifinals at the All Valley tournament for kicking Robby when his back was turned, an angry Johnny confronts him, but Hawk shows no remorse. Hawk seemingly starts losing faith in Johnny, and is being more obedient to Johnny's sensei Kreese. In the finale of season 2, Hawk and a handful of students have joined Kreese, who has now taken over the dojo. When Johnny confronts Hawk and the students, Hawk angrily blames Johnny for all of Miguel's injuries. When he tries to apologize to them, Hawk is shown telling Johnny that they, the students, paid the price for Johnny going soft on them. However, Johnny rebuttals and tells him that Kreese doesn't actually care about Hawk and that he helped him flipped the script and not Kreese. During the fight at Sam's house, Hawk realizes that his former sensei is right and defects to help defeat Cobra Kai, later joining Johnny's new Eagle Fang Karate and training with them and Miyagi-Do against Cobra Kai.

He is shown being envious of Robby after Robby gets the snake from the zoo and impresses his friends. When Kreese says that Robby is exactly what Cobra Kai is looking for, a jealous Hawk isn't happy with that. Although they were never really friendly, they likely became enemies again when Hawk defected from Cobra Kai.
