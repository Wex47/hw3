   into a corner and wouldn't let up. Despite someone else having been cast instead, Kanan was called back to replace the actor, who did not work out. Sean Kanan beat out 2,000 other martial arts hopefuls for the part of Mike Barnes. During the filming of the movie he trained in Shitō-ryū at a school run by Karate master Fumio Demura, and with stunt coordinator and Tang Soo Do master Pat E. Johnson. During filming, Kanan trained extensively, eventually getting injured when he performed a stunt that required him to lunge forward and land on his stomach for 20 takes. After taking aspirin for four days to deal with the residual pain, Kanan fell unconscious. At a hospital, he was diagnosed with internal bleeding caused by a torn abdominal wall, the aspirin having exacerbated the bleeding. After an emergency surgery, Kanan returned to filming a few days later with "staples up and down [his] stomach". Despite the filmmakers offering to have a stunt double perform his complex Karate stunts, Kanan felt that he had trained too hard to not follow through and did all of his own stunts regardless, except for one where his car is almost hit by an Amtrak train. Mike Barnes' final dialogue (wherein he triumphantly jeers Daniel into getting up for the "Sudden Death" portion of their grand championship match) was not in the screenplay, but rather ad-libbed by Sean Kanan.
