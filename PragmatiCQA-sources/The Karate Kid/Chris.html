   Chris is still at odds with the Cobra Kai's, most notably
   Mitch
   . After
   Nathaniel
   is beaten up by
   Hawk
   and Mitch,
   Samantha
   re-opens Miyagi-Do, with Chris re-joining. One day at the arcade, where Chris works, Hawk, Mitch, Mikey, and Doug get up to no good in the arcade, causing Chris to call Sam for help. Sam,
   Demetri
   ,
   Stiven
   , and an unnamed Miyagi-Do student arrive to help their friend, resulting in a fight to break out between Miyagi-Do and Cobra Kai. Chris is attacked from behind by Mitch, but replies with an elbow to the face, knocking him back. Mitch then attacks but is denied by Chris' solid defending. Left exposed, Chris uses his agility to sneak under Mitch's punch and drop him to the floor with ease, beating him one on one. Miyagi-Do gain full dominance during the fight until more Cobra's arrive on the premises, which results in them being outnumbered. Chris is soon grabbed and held by
   Doug
   , he calls out for Sam's aid but she is unable to which results in Mitch later returning to help Doug brutally beat up Chris, which earns him and his friends a trip to hospital.

   A few days later, Sam invites Chris, Demetri and their co-students to her house, claiming that she was going to a party. She insists that they're waiting for a keg, but when the doorbell rings things aren't what they seem. Members of the

   (Counter dojo against Cobra Kai) which includes Mitch, arrive under Sam's permission, as she wants both dojos to work together. Chris is one of the first to deny the chance of them working together, he states that breaking Demetri's arm isn't easily forgivable and that he nearly lost his job at Golf N Stuff. Even after sitting down for several minutes he isn't really prepared to work with former Cobra's, but all the beef is squashed and they soon come to an agreement. The group come up with ideas for their new dojo, just before several Cobra Kai's break in, resulting in a fight breaking out. Chris fights with
   Doug
   and the match appears to be even, until

   The morning after the fight, Demetri, Chris, Sam and the other Miyagi-Do students arrive at thier dojo. Soon after Eagle Fang students emerge from the dojo's entry where Hawk reunites with Demetri, Bert reunites with Nate and Mitch reunites with Chris. The pair hug and put their former rivalry behind them before their first training session with

   Once things start to escalate even further between both sensei’s, the plan for both dojos to work together comes to an end, resulting in Chris going back to life without seeing

   Both dojos begin to train alone before the All-Valley and just as they do, a new set of adjustments for the tournament head thier way, including a separate division for the ladies aswell as a weapons display and a division for the boys. Daniel insists that this is good news and let's his male students know that he believes in them but his positivity is later denied by Demetri and Chris. They speak out amongst thier fellow students and don't believe that they stand a chance at all, doubting thier fighting ability and providing evidence that they still lack in confidence. Chris states that Miyagi-Do were better off with Hawk and

   On the day of the All-Valley, Miyagi-Do are one of the first up to present their skills in the weapons display. Chris eases past the tasks, easily demolishing five layers of brick and several planks of wood. Chris also makes it to the Round of 16, but loses in a close match to Cobra Kai's
   Kyler
   , when the latter utilizes the Miyagi-Do techniques. Chris can be seen motivating his co-students as they step up in the following stages of the tournament and celebrating with his team when they win the men's division.

   Chris is friendly and over time is shown to have a kind heart. Shortly after joining Cobra Kai, he becomes exposed to Kreese's vicious teachings, which makes him somewhat of a bully for a short time. He along with some Cobra Kai students attack Demetri in the mall, but he clearly doesn't want involvement in attacking him. Chris advises Hawk to leave Demetri alone at one point. Later down the line, after realizing Kreese's plans are too much, he gives up his opportunity at Cobra Kai and starts a new one at  Miyagi-Do Karate. Despite initially having trouble getting along with Demetri for his actions at the mall, the two soon manage to get along and down the line would become close friends. As a result of him quitting Cobra Kai, his friendship with Mitch ends. Mitch is more than willing to beat him up during the school brawl. However, Chris emerges victorious in the end. He continues to stand up to the Cobra Kai's. Eventually, by the end of the season, he rekindles his friendship with the redeemed Mitch, and the two along with the Miyagi Do and Eagle Fang students, as well as Hawk are training at Miyagi Do.

  <p key="3e9b22af-2523-45eb-97da-27e944b3acb3">
   Despite getting off on the wrong foot with Demetri, the two would go on to become close friends. Chris is a loyal friend to Demetri. He stands by him and consistently defends him. He stops Mitch and Hawk from attacking him at Moon's party. He stands by him when confronted by Hawk, Mitch and Bert at school. He also boosts his confidence, instructing him to block his hits in training, sparring each other and letting him know that he is now popular after defeating Hawk in the school fight.

   Chris has a solid striking technique. He is large, strong, he has a alot of pace. He uses his size well, frequently incorporating takedowns and heavy kicks into his style. When it comes to his defending, it's fairly solid, just goes to show he's a quick learner of

   lessons. He has also shown a talent for improvised weapons and uses his enviorment well and gas helped him combine his fighting and environmental skill into one, such as when he used a school book to beat
   Mitch
   during the high school brawl at the end of season 2, and using a frying pan to stop an incoming attack from
   Doug
   at the end of season 3.
  </p>
  <p key="69075d3a-4912-4f89-acf0-8551907a7409">
   When fighting Mitch in the school brawl in season 2, Chris uses his superior defense and technique, as well as solid offense to gain the upper hand. Despite eventually being kicked to the ground by Mitch, he improvises by using a book to beat him.
  </p>
  <p key="a721af97-5a11-4640-ac8f-f05279636939">
   During his fight with Mitch at the arcade in season 3, Chris easily gains the upper hand by countering his strikes and then dropping him to the ground, beating him one on one with ease. Chris being able to take out Mitch quicker during their rematch provides evidence that there's a major skill gap between them.
  </p>
  <p key="3e7d8b60-cc73-4911-85c2-3299b4aca4f8">
   While often beating Mitch without much effort, Chris seems to have more trouble fighting Doug, most likely because the latter is ruthless and more aggressive.
  </p>
  <p key="2002bbbd-95e2-47ad-a703-3c938263be8e">
   Despite Chris' solid technique, it is currently not as great as several others. Chris being taken out by more than one enemy at the same time has become a reccuring theme, during the arcade showdown he wins his fight against Mitch, before the latter and Doug team up to take him out together and during the LaRusso house fight he manages to remain in the battle whilst fighting Doug until Tory later steps in and helps her fellow student. A good reason for this might be due to the fact Chris is a skilled fighter than carries a lot of size, which results in him being seen as a threat above most.
  </p>
  <p key="685bbdeb-f205-4069-b969-203128465bde">
   During season 4, Chris' skills have clearly adapted. He was able to ease past training sessions including striking pads and object destruction. Chris' striking power has improved majorly, as seen when he is easily able to break several planks of wood in half during training, as well as at the skills competition. He also demolishes five layers  of brick during the skills competition of the All Valley tournament with ease. In the one on one matchups during thr All-Valley tournament, he finds himself in a  2-2 with tie
   Kyler
   in the round of 16. In the third round, Chris presented some solid attacking strikes, but was caught off guard by Kyler utilizing Miyagi-Do techniques, which led to Chris being edged by the latter and losing the match in the last round.
