   She has a father who was a famous athlete. Both she and Sam were friends when they were younger, but at some point Sam befriended the popular crowd which strained their friendship, though the two are still on good and speaking terms. Outside of Sam, Aisha doesn't have any known friends. Aisha is often bullied because of her weight, and for a lot, her looks (for Yasmine and her clique, it is not looking like a Barbie). Another factor in Aisha's life is that her father is not pushing her to relive his sports career, instead nurturing her own interests, at one point praising her for creating a robot.

Aisha's aptitude also gained the attention of

   Aisha's father is a famous athlete, yet she is not known for her prowess in sports. This is something she struggles with, exacerbated by being often bullied, particularly by
   Yasmine
   and her friend
   Moon
   (to an extent). She used to be friends with
   Samantha LaRusso.
   While they are no longer friends, they seem to be on good terms. After finding about

   she decides to join. Cobra Kai has never had a female student, and Johnny at first is not keen on her joining, he did see about testing her by having her fight
   Miguel Diaz
   in a sparring match. She managed to land a knee drop to his ribs and spear his midsection, earning Johnny's praise that she had untapped potential, or "a natural Cobra". Even Miguel was shocked by this sudden attack, but his sensei brushed it off that in this case, anything goes, lumberjack style. It was unknown if she was friends with Miguel prior to this, but Miguel knew enough about Aisha and her family to the extent he privately convinces her sensei she could be a faithful student if her father is paying for the lessons.

   When the tables turn on Samantha after she finds out her boyfriend Kyler was a lying cheat, Kyler retaliates by slandering Samantha throughout the school, making her a pariah to everyone except Miguel. Aisha also unsympathetically turns her back on Samantha, figuring it served her right for her earlier ostracism. After finding about Yasmine's party, Aisha along with
   Eli Moskowitz
   , Miguel and
   Demetri
   crash the party. During the party, she and Moon make amends after Moon apologizes to her for bullying her, and she gets her revenge on Yasmine by giving her a wedgie, thus humiliating her in front of everyone. During the All valley tournament, Aisha reaches the quarterfinals where she loses to the defending champion
   Xander Stone
   . Following her loss, Samantha congratulates her. While Aisha is hostile with her at first, she seemingly forgives Samantha after she apologizes to her and tells her her revenge against Yasmine was great. The two then laugh about Aisha's revenge against Yasmine. Aisha encourages her to get back into karate. After Miguel wins the tournament for Cobra Kai, Aisha along with the other Cobra Kai students cheer.

   Despite forgiving Sam at the tournament, she still has somewhat of a grudge against her, even though Sam wants to fix their friendship. She is even mad at Sam when Daniel attacks the Cobra Kai dojo in his

   During a party at Moon's house, Aisha approaches a drunken Sam and tells her to stop drinking, who in turn accuses her of trashing the Miyagi-Do Dojo, which Aisha denies, and also states that Miguel had nothing to do with it either. She then tells Sam that Miguel returned

   The following morning, Aisha messages Sam asking her if she is okay, but unbeknownst to her Sam's parents Daniel and
   Amanda
   see her message on Sam's computer. Outside the school building, she and Miguel voice their concern over hearing nothing from Tory. When Sam and Tory are fighting at school, Aisha tries to stop them, but when a boy attacks her, she fights back and beats him up.

  <p key="4dd38765-2709-4427-9123-be43613242f0">
   Aisha is kindhearted, responsible, and highly intelligent. Like the rest of the kids in Cobra Kai, her personality takes a dark turn once she starts learning the aggressive and merciless techniques of the dojo. However, Aisha seems to have not been affected by it as badly as some of the other students, such as Eli and Miguel, since she resumed friendship with Sam at the tournament. This suggests that maybe Aisha will return to her old ways once again.
  </p>
  <p key="3d828d03-a3ab-4580-a66b-75f3ec1e64cc">
   Despite being a nice and kind person she has shown her aggressive side on occasions. Some examples include being rude to Samantha and not showing her any sympathy when she is excluded from the popular crowd, giving Yasmine a wedgie, and angrily lashing out at the defending champion after losing to him in the quarterfinals. Her aggression is generally a mirror of how she herself was treated, figuring Sam deserved to be ostracized as she herself was when the shoe is on the other foot, and giving Yasmine a wedgie in revenge for the Halloween prank. The only bad attitude that was unrequited was her reaction to
   Xander Stone
   beating her fair and square in the tournament, which seemed to reflect poor sportsmanship.
  </p>
  <p key="80815509-9df1-4637-ba1d-8ae7ce04a287">
   She still holds somewhat of a grudge against Sam, though she does care about her which is evidenced in a party where she shows concern for a drunk and dizzy Sam. She makes a new friend named Tory who is new to Cobra Kai. When Tory steals alcohol, both of them are drinking, which shows Aisha was willing to break rules from time to time. However, unlike Sam nor Tory Aisha was not seen getting drunk, which also shows she exerted better self-control, likely only drinking a little. During Sam's and Tory's fight Aisha tries to get them to stop, which shows she knows that things are getting out of hand, though she ends up knocking out a boy who attacks her. She still doesn't seem to be corrupted by the Cobra Kai mentality and John Kreese's teachings which has corrupted many students especially Hawk.
  </p>
  <p key="96e64b67-75e2-494e-8ede-e82e00a2a6a3">
   After Kreese takes over the dojo she is not seen training with him, possibly indicating she may oppose Kreese's methods. Another possibility is that her parents are aware of Kreese's takeover and refuse to pay her tuition any further in that they are unsure of Kreese or lack confidence in his abilities as a sensei; earlier having praised Johnny for helping Aisha discover her athetic potential.

   Before training with Cobra Kai Aisha showed some penchant for brawling, taking Miguel down with a football tackle and a knee drop. After joining the dojo she develops a simple but effective fighting style based on power and straightforward techniques. Her defense is solid and she's fairly quick on her feet.

   Sam was Aisha's friend, however, their relationship is strained. Aisha and Samantha were friends before the series, but at some point before the series, Samantha became friends with the popular crowd, who often bullied Aisha. While Sam's actions strained their friendship, they were still on friendly and speaking terms.

   During the early parts of season 1, Aisha and Sam are on speaking and good terms, despite Sam's association with the rude popular crowd. Despite disapproving the crowd, most notably Yasmine bullying Aisha, Sam never stands up for Aisha, possibly out of peer pressure. Halfway into the season when Sam loses her friends and becomes an outcast, Aisha shows no sympathy and is cold to her, possibly because she feels that Samantha is getting what she deserves. However, she seemingly forgives Samantha after she apologizes to her and tells her her revenge against Yasmine was great. The two then laugh about Aisha's revenge against Yasmine. Aisha encourages her to get back into karate.

Following the celebration however, they aren't seen together again, though it is likely that they are still friends.

After taking down Miguel, Johnny becomes impressed and Aisha worked to ensure that he saw her as another student. After seeing how strong Aisha is, Johnny was more open to including female students in Cobra Kai. His teachings helped Aisha grow into a confident young woman, though she was forced to leave the dojo when her parents transferred her to a private school following the school brawl.
