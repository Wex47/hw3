   , along with his friend James, arrive at a diner to eat. Betsy is upset with David because he kept kicking the opposing football team while they were down by continuing to score points against them despite the fact that they had already lost the game. David asserted that the enemy deserves no mercy. An army recruiter arrived and asked if they would consider joining to fight the war in Vietnam. David feigned interest, then crumpled up and threw away the paper once the recruiter had gone. He and James laughed, while Betsy was upset by this. A busboy,

   , saw this and picked up the flier for himself. He and Betsy looked at each other, which angered David, as he tripped Kreese who was taking the dishes back into kitchen. This caused Kreese to be humiliated and frustrated in front of everyone and upset Betsy further.

  <p key="f8dcb380-7abd-4ce4-8317-edd50765da12">
   Later, he was upset that Betsy had made eye contact with Kreese in the diner. he grabbed her firmly and told her never to do it again, and brutally smacked her across the face when she told him to let her go. Kreese was angered at the assault and dropped everything to confront him, demanding to know if David had ever learned to "keep his hands to himself." The boys fought with Betsy being pushed aside when she tried to intervene. At one point David is on the verge of defeating Kreese, but Kreese manages to defeat both David and James, while knocking David unconscious. Exhausted and bruised, but ultimately victorious, Kreese caught Betsy's eye once more, and offered her a lift home. After being defeated, David isn't seen or mentioned, while Kreese starts a relationship with Betsy.

   David is a rude and controlling bully. He is abusive to others, including his own girlfriend. David enjoys demeaning others, something which upsets Betsy as he kept scoring points against the opposing team despite the fact that they had already lost the game, as well as bullied Kreese for making eyes at her. David even pretended to be polite to an army recruiter, only to crumple up the brochure and throw it away while laughing. David also seems to share Kreese's philosophy that the enemy deserves no mercy, and may be where Kreese first got the idea of showing no mercy.

    People originally thought at first that he was Young Kreese due to him looking like him, his bullying and when he said no mercy. However when then realized it wasn’t him because he crumpled up a military invitation and when the bus boy was called up and the manager said “Kreese,” to him.
