They have to work together against Cobra Kai if they want to beat them in the All Valley. Sensei Lawrence jumps in that they have to beat their asses. They're going to learn to be more aggressive, countering "strike first" with "pre-strike". Daniel interjects that they will respond to Cobra Kai's actions. Johnny instantly negates this as eagles don't respond, they swoop down and take. They're going to take back the valley. Thus, begins the differing approaches to warm ups, with the blatant differences in training becoming evident. Sensei Lawrence commands

   After dinner, Carmen and Johnny wash dishes as he tries to say that things with Ali weren't romantic. He's about to tell her his plans on the night of the LaRusso house fight, but she cuts him off. She thinks they should slow things down. She wants to give it time. He unconvincingly agrees to giving it time, but tosses the sponge once she's gone.

A woman walks over to see if things are okay. She introduces herself as Cheyenne, referring to Silver as "Terrance". Kreese believes the pair are married, but she laughs off the allegation - they're merely enjoying the journey for now. She invites him to stay for hors d'oruvres. Kreese stays despite Silver's clear disliking of the idea.

   Meanwhile, Johnny and Daniel prepare their students for the next phase of training. Johnny will take the front yard while Daniel will take the back. Miguel thought they were stronger together, but the sensei's assure the students they're working together - just separately. The students say goodbye to their friends, while Sam and Miguel agree to see each other after class. Johnny welcomes Hawk to Eagle Fang with a front sweep. The class will practice the new move on Hawk, who admits to being a dick but is sorry for his actions. Johnny thinks talk is cheap and calls up the next student,

   Robby lifts weights in the back room of the Cobra Kai dojo. Tory remarks that he's supposed to use a spotter, but he doesn't need one. She calls him out for hiding as he wasn't at the LaRusso fight. He doesn't know what she was thinking breaking into the house, trying to hurt Sam, and then thinking everything would be sunshine and rainbows. She's lucky they didn't call the police. Tory defends herself - she's not straddling the fence like him. Girls like Sam LaRusso think the world revolves around them because all she has to do is make a puppy dog face and say please to get what she wants. She still has Robby wrapped around her finger, after all. He claims that isn't true, but Tory wonders why he's defending her then. If he's going to stay on defense this dojo isn't right for him.

   Meanwhile, Kreese tries to blend-in at the soiree, but the vegan tofu skewers are unappealing. Cheyenne asks about their past, with Kreese admitting they were in the Special Forces together. This is news to her as she didn't know Terrance was in the military. He claims there's not much to tell. Kreese notices a man ogling him, and the man compliments Kreese's impeccable Hasburg jawline. Cheyenne raves that Terrance is hosting the launch of her mindfulness app. She wants to teach student all over the country to be mindful of others and themselves. Kreese likens it to his and Terrance's past with teaching children martial arts. Cheyenne refers to the groups as The Vipers. Kreese corrects that it's Corbra Kai. The man beside him calls an adorable karate phase. Kreese snaps it's a way of life that you can never really leave behind.

   Daniel teaches meditation and emotional control to the Miyagi-Do's, but Eagle Fang's boisterous antics and foul language breaks the team's concentration. Daniel goes outside to ask Johnny to keep it down, taking him around the back to talk in private. Johnny notes that karate isn't exactly a quiet sport.

   Hawk retreats into the dojo where he mutters over having to "walk off" being punched below the belt. He's just trying his best. He notices a painting on the wall and examines it. Demetri enters, explaining it's a sparring deck where Mr. Miyagi's great-grandfather taught karate on the Okinawan waterfront. Hawk touches the frame so

Hawk lowers his guard to give a genuine apology for his past mistakes. Chris tells him to go back to the Eagle gang as he's not wanted in Miyagi-Do. Hawk looks to Demetri for support, but doesn't get it so he leaves.

   Daniel and Johnny argue over the disaster of their teaching styles. Hawk intercepts Daniel as he's having trouble fitting in. Daniel doesn't know what Hawk expected since he burned bridges with everyone here. Depleted, Hawk walks away while a regretful Daniel tries to call him back. The students gather behind the sensei's as Johnny blames Daniel for Hawk walking out of practice. The students watch the increase in bickering as Johnny claim he'll do what he wants with his class, but Daniel knows what Johnny is trying to do. They continue to bicker as they walk away from the students. Miguel and Sam exchange a worried look.
