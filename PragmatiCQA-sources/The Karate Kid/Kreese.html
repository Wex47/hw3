  <p key="cd0c32f1-f267-4cf6-94d2-5d7220cc9e3f">
   John Kreese was born in 1946 and lived in the San Fernando Valley. His home life was unstable and marred by the decline of his mother's mental health. In 1965, his mother committed suicide and left Kreese to fend for himself. He was bullied by his peers for his mother's actions, and labeled a freak due to the stigma around mental health. He acquired a job at a diner, and one day, he was busily wiping the counter as a couple of jocks entered the establishment, one of which had his arm wrapped around the shoulder of a pretty young lady by the name of
   Betsy
   . The jock, David, bumped into Kreese on their way past him without apologizing, prompting him to give them an angry glare, before going back to work. Quickly composing himself, he dutifully proceeded to provide them with silverwares; and briefly caught the eye of Betsy, much to the chagrin of her boyfriend David.
  </p>
  <p key="0077b33d-a7ff-4b03-80f9-a27fc9ac89f8">
   Almost immediately after, a uniformed military officer passed through the diner, hoping to draft young men into the U.S. Army, offering the jocks a pamphlet. David accepted and promised that he and his friend would consider it, only to curl it into a ball with a mocking laugh the moment the officer left. Kreese picked up the pamphlet and unfolded it, intrigued by the idea. He hurriedly stuck it in his pocket as his employer told him scolded him. Kreese went back to work, but as he went to carry a tray full of dirty cutlery into the back, David tripped him, leaving Kreese humiliated as everyone laughed at his misfortune. Betsy was the only one who looked at him with pity.
  </p>
  <p key="c7f95011-4e2a-49b3-a25c-711513e41c4b">
   Shortly thereafter, Kreese was taking out the trash when he saw David and Betsy arguing. David was angry that she had made eye contact with Kreese in the diner. He grabbed her firmly and told her never to do it again, but she quipped back to let her go, prompting David to smack her. Kreese came to Betsy's defense despite David's friend being present. David ridiculed Kreese for his crush on Betsy and his mother's death. David and his friend then attacked Kreese. While Kreese did land some hits, the other two had the advantage for outnumbering him, and gained the upper hand. After Davids' friend threw Kreese into a group of trash cans, David started beating him, and even berated him. However, just as David  was about to kick him again, Kreese regained his bearings and successfully incapacitated the pair of them, and even  retorted to David that he had been fighting bullies all his life. Kreese than offered Betsy a ride home, which she accepted.

   In the time that followed, Kreese dated Betsy, and enlisted in the military. By 1968, Kreese passed the United States Army Basic Combat Training, and was deployed overseas to serve in the Vietnam War. Kreese became known among his fellow patriots for his willingness to take risks, with his commanding officer speaking highly of his actions. He volunteered to walk point on foot patrols and readily joined an ambush unit at great personal risk. As a member of the unit, Kreese befriended fellow soldier
   <a href="Terry Silver.html" key="a3332e11-c296-4695-b116-a2c6b3e93893" title="Terry Silver">

   and a brother-in-arms they affectionately called "Twig".
  </p>
  <p key="754a52f3-e6e7-498c-b6f5-fa1b5c6ddfdb">
   One day, Betsy had sent him a photograph of her, earning the envy of his fellow soldiers. At that moment, he was approached by a Sergeant, who informed him that their Captain wished to speak with him in the command's tent. The Captain, named
   Turner
   , explained that he was forming a special task force that would go on direct action missions in the north of the country. He warned that they would be going "sterile into triple canopy jungle. No insignias, no ID." The team would be led by the Captain Turner himself, and otherwise comprised of Kreese and a couple of other specialists. Allowed to have a say in who these specialists were, Kreese immediately nominated Silver and Twig as candidates for the task at hand.
  </p>
  <p key="b8edeef2-6185-403a-9585-866e731c0803">
   The unit was trained extensively in guerilla tactics, demolition and hand-to-hand combat by Captain Turner. Turner had previously served in the Korean War and was trained in the art of Tang Soo Do under the tutelage of master
   Kim Sun-Yung
   of South Korea. Kreese was taught everything that Turner knew, for the purposes of close quarter combat. During this time, Turner would often berate Kreese for his apparent inability to "shed his humanity" during physical confrontations. At one point during a sparring match, Turner made a point of showcasing this in front of the unit. Kreese had briefly lowered his guard after landing a solid punch on Turner. Turner reprimanded Kreese and warned him to not to lose concentration when he faced an opponent, and to leave no room for hesitation, second thoughts, and to show no mercy to their enemies.
  </p>
  <p key="aa6c7a71-3825-4899-8a59-d036a8c20752">
   The following day, the task force embarked on their long-awaited reconnaissance mission. They canvassed a compound belonging to the The People's Army of Vietnam. As

   tried to get hold of air support, Kreese monitored the campsite with a pair of binoculars. He watched as his fellow comrade and friend
   <a href="Ponytail.html" key="eb3e7176-4c7c-4200-bc92-6c46f383ea9f" title="Ponytail">
    Ponytail
   </a>
   snuck to the edge of the compound to set explosives. Silver's radio erupted and Kreese was ordered by Turner to blow the compound to avoid being caught. Kreese hesitated as Ponytail was still inside and thought his friend could escape in time. Ponytail and the rest of the unit were spotted and taken capture by the Vietnamese enemies.
  </p>
  <p key="4a7afb39-ac22-405a-b86e-c43984f076e6">
   The unit was subjected to several forms of torture and punishment, including being locked inside a bamboo cage. The captors made an example of Ponytail by executing him, a casualty that horrified Kreese. Turner blamed Kreese for Ponytail's death and their capture. The unit was then were made to fight one another on a platform suspended over a pit full of venomous snakes, all for the amusement of the Vietnamese soldiers. Kreese tried to look to their commanding officer for leadership, who simply remarked on the unlikelihood of their survival and told him that there were no ranks anymore, with there being every man for himself. When one of his fellow soldiers threw another into the pit, Kreese became uncomfortable. When Silver began to panic, it fell to Kreese to be the one to talk him down. Silver was picked to fight Turner, and Silver refused due to his panicked state. Kreese volunteered to take his place which the captors allowed.
  </p>
  <p key="ef01c0c6-3540-49dc-95ee-56566b4b14c1">
   As they approached the pit, Turner, who had still not forgiven Kreese for their capture, voiced his certainty that he was going to win. Turner claimed that unlike Kreese, he had as he, something to fight for. Kreese objected to the insinuation, only for Turner to inform him that Betsy had died. A letter had arrived to their camp before their deployment informing Kreese that Betsy had been in a fatal car accident. Overcome with grief, Kreese initially fell to his knees but forced up by the captors and onto the platform. Captain Turner overpowered Kreese, having him on the ground and at his mercy. He mocked Kreese once more for his perceived weakness as this was a matter of kill or be killed. Despite on the verge of being thrown into the pit, Kreese was able to stab Turner in the leg with a broken piece of bamboo, and then gain the upper hand and defeat his Captain. Turner hung from the platform, just as the American military support arrived at the camp to save the unit. Turner told Kreese the fight was over and to pull him up, but Kreese coldly replied that he hadn't taken Turner's lessons to heart, but that he would never make that mistake again. Kreese resolved to show Turner  "

    no mercy
   </i>
   " by sending Turner to his death in the cobra pit. He freed the rest of the soldiers, with Silver being the only one to stop and acknowledge him for it; embracing him like a brother and vowing to always be there for Kreese for the rest of their lives.
  </p>
  <p key="cfbb57d8-68ff-4d20-868b-4537f6e7b822">
   With the mission completed and his military superiors unaware of the full details regarding Turner's death, Kreese received recognition for his contribution to the war. The surviving members of their unit earned berets add a U.S. battlefield commission. Kreese proceeded to serve in a Green Beret unit of the United States Army Special Force for the rest of the war, attaining the rank of Captain himself. Kreese and Silver continued to serve together, with Kreese saving Silver's life several times between 1969 and 1975.

   They continued their rigorous workouts and sparring matches throughout the remainder of the war, along with others in their infantry company. According to

   , they at one point even found themselves under the tutelage of
   Kim Sun-Yung
   himself. Excelling at martial arts, Kreese became the U.S. Army's Karate champion; a title he held from 1970 to 1972. He eventually retired from the military and returned to the valley hardened and embittered by the numerous bereavements he suffered in the war, not least of all the loss of his beloved Betsy. He vowed to never lose again, and his mind and heart stayed on the battlefield while the rest of him returned home. He eventually resolved to instill strength and discipline through karate. With the help of Terry Silver, Kreese opened a karate dojo upon returning to The Valley, whose name and symbol was inspired by his victory over the snake pit -

   . For the next decade, Kreese trained young men in "the way of the fist", and instilled in them the creed that Turner had once taught him. He donned a motto for this creed, "
   <i key="9e0d7df5-cdd6-4884-a1ff-689053ba0239">

   discovered and joined the dojo. One day after a session where Johnny had just been awarded his blue belt, Kreese found Johnny crying over the difficulty of his home life and the strained relationship he had with his stepfather. Kreese was completely unsympatheic, telling Johnny that the moment tears leaves his eyes that he would become a loser and that he did not teach losers.  He then forced Johnny to renounce his previous ways, forcing Johnny to shout several times that he was a winner.

Kreese was proven right when Johnny won the tournament on behalf of Cobra Kai Dojo in 1982 and 1983. The dojo had also won the tournament two times prior to Johnny's first victory (presumably in 1979 and 1980), giving Cobra Kai a total of 4 titles, under Kreese's leadership.

   This was a tipping point for Kreese's emotional stability, as his later personality can only be described as cold, calculating, aggressive, and bad-tempered. He created a karate dojo which he poured his life into, but his deep-hatred for outsiders or people who he deemed weak would be his downfall. He instilled the same fear, merciless, and aggressive way of thinking into his students. He subjected them to arguably the worst forms of psychological, and sometimes physical, abuse until they did what he expected of them. He shaped young men into his image; aggressive, sexist, and hateful. Kreese has a deep hatred for his competitor and Japanese sensei

He pressured Johnny into winning the All-Valley tournament, but when he failed, Kreese attacked the teenager and tried to choke him to death. He attacked his students but was stopped by Miyagi, who once again, stopped Kreese from following through with what Kreese deemed an appropriate action. His obsession escalated as he recruited an

   This plan also failed, leaving a prideful Kreese once again humiliated. He spiraled into a drunken, drug-addicted, homeless stupor. He began to experience PTSD from his time in the war, but was to proud to accept help when it was offered. Over three decades later, Kreese heard of the reopening of Cobra Kai and returned in search of the glory he had lost before. He enacted a rouse to get Johnny to trust him again, using the subvert manipulations to eventually steal the dojo back. As the sensei of Cobra Kai once again, he continues to corrupt his students mind and convince them to go to war with Miyagi Do. He has shown multiple cruel and sadistic traits towards those he believes have betrayed him or that refuse to conform to his way of behaving. Kreese has no qualms breaking the law, manipulating people, and even attempting murder if it means salvaging his pride. He doesn't care if his opponent is weaker then him, so long as they can be beaten.

His skills was such that he held the title of karate champion of the United States army from 1970 to 1972, before he eventually went on to continue his training under said master himself.

He will do anything, no matter how underhanded, to win. That said, he is a good all-around fighter with a solid defense and good counters. According to Johnny, Kreese's 'ultimate kick' is the roundhouse kick. However, the years have cost him some of his ability; his student Johnny Lawrence, who was once putty in his hands, fought with him on reasonably equal terms. He never approached Miyagi in terms of skill, with Miyagi defeating him effortlessly on two occasions.

   Prior to joining the military, he defeated both David and his friend, despite being outnumbered. Despite initally being overpowered by Turner in Vietnam, he regained his footing after stabbing him with a bamboo stick, and proceeded to defeat and kill his captain. Even as a septuagenarian, Kreese is capable of fighting against his former pupil Johnny twice, subduing Tory's landlord, beating up Zarkarian's nephews, and throwing Daniel through a glass pane. While he does have the upper hand for the majority of his first fight with Johnny, he is eventually overpowered by the latter. However, after Johnny shows mercy, Kreese wins by exploiting Johnny's newfound merciful nature. During second fight with Johnny, the latter repeatedly gets the better of Kreese, and Kreese is only able to get the upper hand when Johnny is focused on Robby and not paying attention to the fight. During his fight against Daniel, the latter gains the upper hand by disabling Kreese through pressure point techniques. While a modern day Kreese is still a strong and capable fighter, it is clear he has lost some of his strength overtime.

After joining Cobra Kai, Johnny quickly becomes Kreese's top student. The two would develop a bond, mostly on Johnny's end, as he looked up to Kreese. He instructs Johnny to be merciless. However, after ordering him to sweep Daniel's leg in the finals of the all valley tournament, Johnny expresses discomfort, while realizing Kreese has gone too far, but reluctantly proceeds.
