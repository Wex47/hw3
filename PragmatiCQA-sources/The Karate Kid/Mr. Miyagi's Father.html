   Miyagi's father was born in

   , his father was a fisherman (as well as the rest of his family before him), who taught him karate. At some point, he married and later became the father of
   <a href="Mr. Miyagi.html" key="83243755-2d3b-4bec-bfe1-c7ee33363feb" title="Mr. Miyagi">
    Nariyoshi Miyagi
   </a>
   . His first name is unknown. In the past, he was both a fisherman and karate master who trained his son to use the art in the right way. He was also
   Sato Toguchi
   's sensei. At the beginning of the movie the audience finds out that he is still alive; however, he has become ill due to his very old age and later dies, but not before seeing his son one last time. As sensei to Miyagi and Sato, both men came to his side at his hour of death. His final act was to bring the two former close friends together, most likely encouraging them to make peace. Then, out of respect, Sato let Miyagi grieve over his father's death for three days before both of them have a fight; however, Sato has a change of heart after Miyagi saves his life during a typhoon, and both men reconcile and became friends again, thus fulfilling Miyagi's father's dying wish.

   Miyagi taught his son and Sato karate. The first lesson he taught him was that the best way to avoid a punch was to simply not be there in the first place by using the drum technique, but only as a last resort. He also notably taught his son the "crane technique," which is rumored to be unable to defend against if performed correctly.
