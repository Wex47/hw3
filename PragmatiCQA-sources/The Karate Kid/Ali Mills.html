He kept the feeling to himself though, considering Tommy's condition. When Johnny and Tommy are talking in the woods the night before the latter's passing, Tommy tells him that he had a crush on Ali in his younger days and joined Cobra Kai in order to develop the courage to ask her out. However, he never did so, as Ali was dating Johnny, and he refused to let a woman come between him and a fellow Cobra. Johnny laughed it off, saying he had a lot of women in his life, but Ali was "the one that got away".

For instance, she got angry and vocal towards Johnny when he beat up Daniel at the beach, as well as when Johnny forced a kiss on her at the country club without her consent. She also was openly hurt when Daniel questioned Ali's intentions at Golf-N-Stuff about her commitment to him.
