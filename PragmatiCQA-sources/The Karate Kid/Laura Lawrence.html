  <p key="ba41020f-1a2c-467f-a988-b146702c44a8">
   While Johnny was very young, his father left him and Laura for unknown reasons.  Laura did her best to raise Johnny on her own during this time, as there were implied hardships during these early years.
  </p>
  <p key="1f338b7e-5e2a-432d-a968-b2863413e8a2">
   At somepoint when Johnny was still very young, Laura approached Johnny late one night, and told him that Sid had proposed to her and was going to be his new father and promised Johnny that things were going to be much better.   Johnny would storm off into his room and she found Johny seeking comfort in a large box of things that had belonged to his father.  Laura got very angry, saying he should not have saved these things and that they both had to move on from his father.  She angrily told him that his old father had left them, and that Johnny was going to have a new father from now on, and took the box of these items and said she was going to destroy them.

   Laura would go on to marry

   , a very wealthy yet clouth man whom was a high level television producer in Hollywood and would move her and Johnny into his mansion in the hills.   Sid treated Johnny poorly thru out his life, endlessly ridiculing him for his many failures in school and in social settings.
  </p>
  <p key="02404171-9d2f-48a4-8d1d-95fd208c93aa">
   One day, Johnny returned to the mansion, and excitedly told his parents about how he had wanted to take karate classes as the

   he had just found.  Sid at first ridiculed Johnny, and cited his failures at drums, with a magicians set, and other things, but Laura defended Johnny, and convinced him to pay for Johnny's karate lessons.

   , for guidance instead of to Laura and Sid. It's not entirely known if Laura ever actually met  Kreese or saw the man in action with her son and his students.  She would have almost certainly attended Johnny's karate tournaments, and she would have almost certainly met Johnny's Cobra Kai teammates, both at tournaments and in social settings.   It is doubtful that she ever witnessed Johnny or his Cobra Kai teammate's in their bad-boy behavior, as Johnny and his friends often put on one face in front of adults and one for others they were tormenting.
  </p>
  <p key="301d355c-18f0-40dc-b368-f25f59c81c32">
   After high school, Johnny continued to rely on Sid's financial support, and it was implied that it was only because of Laura that Sid continued to do so.   By Johnny's own words, he partied his twenties and most of his thirties away, and still had access to the

   When Laura  died in 2002 (of still unrevealed reasons), the family disintegrated as only Johnny and Sid were left - they never considered each other family to begin with, and the already-poor father-son relationship devolved further into nasty hatred. Sid grew to detest Johnny even more, as prior to her death she made Sid promise that he would watch out for Johnny.  Despite his hatred of Johnny, Sid would keep his promise to Laura from her death in 2002, until the fall of 2017, bailing Johnny out of jail on many occasions.  It was the fall of 2017 when Sid, tired of Johnny's many transgressions, bought him out of his life.

   It is apparent that Johnny loved his mother very much, as he keeps a framed photo of her in his living room alongside a picture of a younger Robby, and looks at both often.

   , Johnny has a flashback to when he was a little boy (appeared to be about 7, which would be about 1974).  In it, his mother Laura enters into his room, and announces how happy she is that she and Sid will be getting married.  Johnny is resistant to this, and refuses to accept it.  Laura discovers a large box of gear that belonged to his father, and Laura is very angry at him for having kept this stuff that she had believed had already been thrown out.  Laura indicates that she is going to destroy these mementos of his father, and that Johnny is to accept her marriage to Sid, which Johnny begins to cry over it.
