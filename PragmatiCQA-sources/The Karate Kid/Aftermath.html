Trying to regain control of the meeting failed even when Principal Lopez says "Parents, we are all trying to move on and handle this with the most appropriate response.".

   As Johnny is sitting in jail, he gets recognized by the cop, who then continues to insult Robby, saying "garbage doesn't fall far from the truck". Johnny immediately gets defensive, saying Robby is nothing like him and is actually a good kid, who just made a mistake, his life shouldn't be over as a result of this. The cop retorts "Tell that to the kid he killed", to which Johnny visibly worries about, asking what he meant. The cop says he isn't a doctor, but two weeks in a coma and the coma usually wins.

   tells Mr. and Mrs. LaRusso that he found something they need to see. He then tells them that as he was taking inventory, he noticed a car was missing, a
   1993 Dodge Grand Caravan
   , which has been gone a couple of weeks. Amanda and Danny think that Robby took it, as he knew the gate codes. Amanda says they should call the cops, as all their cars have GPS trackers in them so they can track him down. Danny however wants to go look for Robby himself, saying that if the cops find him before he turns himself in things will be a lot worse for Robby. Danny instructs Louie to find the VIN number and text him the location of the GPS.

   Johnny gets dropped off at the hospital by his bail bondsman, who threatens Johnny if he misses his court date. Miguel is still having the dream sequence of the fight at the next All Valley, interspersed with flashbacks of the fight, his
   mother

   Danny is tracking down Robby, but the GPS only leads him to the box, which Robby had taken out of the car. He calls Amanda, who asks if there was anyplace nearby that he could have gone, and Danny believes there is one.

   Johnny sees a doctor's coat laying around and goes to the bathroom to try it on. However, someone comes out of their stall, already asking Johnny a medical question, but when he sees Johnny's face he remarks "You're not a doctor" and continues on his way. Johnny, knowing that he couldn't pass off as a doctor, throws the coat in the trash. He remembers that patients could go into the ICU and decides to headbutt a napkin dispenser to bloody his head. He goes to the nurse, saying he needs to see a doctor.

   Daniel meanwhile arrives at Miyagi-Do Karate, where he sees a take out container from In 'N Out Burger. Thinking it is Robby, he walks through the panels to the backyard and sees Sam. He asks if she's with Robby, to which she says no and asks in return if he's heard from him. Danny says no and questions why she's not at school; Sam said she wasn't ready, with everybody staring at her. Danny and her then have a heart to heart, Sam saying that being in a fight as a girl everyone thinks you are crazy whether you win or lose, and that she's really scared for Miguel and Robby. Danny reassures her that it is not her fault, saying it was his own as if it wasn't for him and Johnny, there wouldn't have been a fight at all. Sam then says "I though we were the good guys", to which Danny reassures her that they are, since they try to be which is the most important. Danny then says that you can't run away from problems, as he can't from his, and hugs Sam.

   Johnny is getting stitches, the nurse says that he needs to  be kept overnight as there is blood in his urine, which he says is normal after a fight and will go away 2-3 days. He then shows them a large bruising on his back, to which both nurses with him leave, telling him to wait there. He then goes and visits Miguel. He talks to him, saying that he only wanted to help him, but he instead failed him, apologizing and saying that he needs to pull through and just has to keep fighting, not give up and reassures him that he knows Miguel is capable of winning. This speech is given while Miguel is having another dream sequence of the All Valley.

   is in the dojo. Kreese says Johnny's not there right now, but he will be back, continuing on about the fight. He says it was a shame, what happened, but he doesn't blame Robby, as "there's no such thing as a bad student". He remarks how it must hurt that the Miyagi name is being dragged through the mud, wishing he could see the look on Mr. Miyagi's face. Danny is clearly stirred by this, but decides against fighting him, he states that Miyagi beat Kreese on multiple occasions. Kreese says that he will fight him, but that Johnny and Kreese will finish it this time. Danny says that he won't do anything as long as he's around and Kreese finishes by telling Danny that he knows where Kreese can be found.

   Daniel is waiting by Johnny's complex, seeing that he has two black eyes and asking what happened to him. Johnny asks what he wants, Danny says he went to the Cobra Kai dojo and saw his old sensei there after thinking that Kreese was gone, asking what happened. Johnny says he has a headache and doesn't want to talk about it, rather wanting some sleep. Danny says he has a lead on Robby and that he's been trying to find him, to which Johnny stops and turns around. They bury the hatchet and team up to look for Robby, this happening in speech playing over visuals of Robby as a runaway and Sam getting over her fear of the stairs and a flashback of when Tory clawed her arm. Miguel seems to be in distress, his heart rate high, as he is having a dream sequence of the All Valley fight, which he wins and then wakes up. The end credits and dedication for Rob Garrison then proceed.
