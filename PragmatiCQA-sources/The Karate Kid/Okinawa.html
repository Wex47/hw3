The Ryukyu Islands extend southwest from Kagoshima Prefecture in Kyushu (the southwesternmost of Japan's four main islands) to Taiwan. Naha, Okinawa's capital, is located in the southern part of Okinawa Island.

   Okinawa is located in the southern part of Japan. According to Daniel's book on Okinawan history, the biggest U.S. air base in the Pacific ocean is on Okinawa, Kadena Air Base. Mr. Miyagi's village, Tomi Village, is south of Naha along the sea. There was no airport in Okinawa when Miyagi originally left for America by boat. Tomi Village is a fishing village (including but not limited to mackerel), but after World War II, Sato's father brought in a big commercial fishing boat, and within two years, all the fish were gone. The cannery remains standing, however. As a result, most people went to Naha City for employment. Mr. Miyagi's father and other residents went into the vegetable business. Sato owned the farms, which were rented by the village.

   In the village is a Miyagi's family dojo. Photos of 400 years worth of all of Miyagi's ancestors are on the wall, including Miyagi Shimpo Sensei, the first Miyagi to bring karate to Okinawa, who went to China in 1625. Shimpo Sensei was a fisherman who arrived at China by accident. Ten years later, he returned to Okinawa with a Chinese wife and two children and the secret of
   Miyagi-Do Karate
   : a pellet drum.

  <p key="7fd95cd0-b7bb-4cd3-90b4-db53763ee7f7">
   There is also a Shinto shrine in the village and a pillbox leftover from World War II.

    (1984), Mr. Miyagi refers to Okinawa as "[his] country". Technically, this is incorrect because Okinawa is now a part of Japan, and has been since 1879. However, Okinawa was independent for centuries prior to becoming a part of Japan.
