   (the northern quadrant of Oz), the beautiful Princess Gayelette resided in a handsome palace built from great rocks of ruby.

   As a powerful sorceress, all her magic was used to help her people, and she never hurt anyone who was good. Hence, she was beloved by her subjects, but she was also vain, short-tempered, and fastidious. Her inability to find a husband who was equal to her in beauty and wisdom was her greatest sorrow, but she eventually found a handsome boy named

   When he grew to manhood, Quelala and Gayelette were engaged to be married, and the latter spent half her kingdom to create a beautiful

   who lived nearby tossed Quelala into a river as a prank. Gayelette was furious, and wanted to drown the Monkeys in the same river as punishment, but upon the King of the Monkeys' pleas and Quelala's speaking in their favour, she spared them, though it was still conditional: henceforth, whoever the owner of the Golden Cup was, the Monkeys had to obey that owner's bidding three times.
  </p>
  <p key="f172596c-d9d8-433c-8d14-778c32223530">
   Aware of how Gayelette still could not bear the sight of the Monkeys, as well as how said Monkeys were all deathly afraid of her, Quelala summoned them to him after he had married her, and commanded them to always keep out of her sight, which they gladly did. Nevertheless, it can be presumed that Gayelette and Quelala lived happily ever after.

   Gayelette was described to be a powerful sorceress whose potent magic made her loved by her subjects (whom she helped) and feared by those who crossed her (such as the Winged Monkeys). Examples of powers she derived from her magic were:

     Supernatural Beauty (possibly):
    </b>
    Gayelette was beautiful - so beautiful, in fact, that for a long time until she met Quelala, she was unable to find a truly worthy husband, and while it was never specifically stated or confirmed, it was still highly likely that her beauty was constant, eternal, and never faded with time, especially given her being such a powerful sorceress.

     Wish Granting:

       Beauty Inducement:
      </b>
      Through her power of wish granting, Gayelette was also able to access the power to increase the physical beauty of others, making them more pleasing aesthetically - while Quelala's other commendable virtues (such as strength, goodness, and wisdom) were dramatically enhanced through her magic, his most notable quality was his handsomeness, which was so great that she loved him dearly.

     Mythical Beast Manipulation:

       Mythical Beast Enslavement:
      </b>
      Through her power of mythical beast manipulation, Gayelette also had the power to subjugate mythical beasts by dominating them and their ability to be independent beings - in exchange for sparing the Monkeys' lives, she made them the eternal slaves to whoever the Golden Cap's owner may be (wherever they may be, they were bound to always present themselves to the owner when said owner summoned them through the cap's charm, and they also had to do whatever said owner's bidding was, unless it was well and truly beyond their capabilities, and said owner can only command them three times). As demonstrated by Glinda, the only way to permanently break this magical enslavement was for an owner to, after having commanded the Monkeys three times, give the cap to the King of the Monkeys, and officially declaring them free.
