   Reilly &amp; Britton
   starting in 1908, and remained in print into the 1920s. In 1906 he illustrated the serialization of Baum's

  <p key="7a19db36-c41b-4e12-9957-fafeca371899">
   Originally, Neill's illustrations were reminiscent of Denslow's, to bring continuity and familiarity to the characters. Denslow's illustrations had been quite popular. However, as the series expanded, Neill brought his own unique flair to the illustrations, showing more artistic representations of the characters as well as beautiful paintings of numerous scenes. In fact, he was later named the Royal Painter of Oz.

   Neill continued to illustrate the Oz books after Baum's death, and his artwork was praised for helping give Ruth Plumly Thompson's books "legitimacy" in the eyes of Baum's fans. Neill would eventually succeed Thomspson as the designated "
