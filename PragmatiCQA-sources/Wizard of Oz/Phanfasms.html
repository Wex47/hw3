   The Phanfasms appear to be wild creatures, with the heads of various mammals, birds, and reptiles. They have hairy humanoid bodies and wear minimal clothing. They generally carry primitive weapons, like clubs.

   Phanfasms have very powerful magic. They live in one of the most luxurious and splendid cities ever built by magic, but to outside eyes it appears to be a barren waste of rock heaps.
