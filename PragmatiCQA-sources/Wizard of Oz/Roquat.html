He made an alliance with the boy to conquer the Land of Oz by inspiring an army of beasts to attack the Emerald City and then transforming the beasts into humans and the humans into beasts. He got into the country without Ozma's knowledge and created havoc. He was transformed into a nut by the Wizard of Oz, and then restored to his proper shape only to be made to drink from the Water of Oblivion again. Ozma decreed that he should be kept in the Land of Oz and educated there, so as not to return to his evil nature as he would among the Nomes. He again drank of the Water of Oblivion, and to stop him ever going bad again Ozma settled him in the Emerald City. (
