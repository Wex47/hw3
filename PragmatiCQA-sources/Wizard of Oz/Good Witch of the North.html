As demonstrated by her interaction with Dorothy, despite her limitations, Locasta would still help those in need to the very best of her capacity - advising Dorothy to go to the

   Physically, Locasta Tattypoo has purple eyes and short curly white hair. She always wears a clean white pointed hat that reaches a foot above her head with little silver bells that run across the brim and jingle ever so sweetly as she moves. Her hat is also a magical one and can also turn into a magic slate with magic white chalk letters she can consult for wise answers when in need of any advice. Her dress is a very long and poofy, sparkling ball gown of pure white yet sprinkled with glittering half-moons and little stars all about that glow brightly even in the sunlight. She also carries a large magic wand that has the initial "

     Divination:
    </b>
    Locasta had the power to gain insight into a question or situation using an occult, standardized process or ritual, which she channeled through her magical hat - by balancing the point of her hat at the end of her nose and counting to three, the hat would transform into a slate on which would be written the answer to her question.

     Defense Manipulation:

    Locasta had the power to manipulate defensive powers, bestowing them on whoever she desired - she gave Dorothy a powerful magical kiss on her forehead (

     Teleportation:

     Evil Immunity (possibly):
    </b>
    Even before she became a Witch, it was highly likely that Locasta had the innate ability to be immune to anything evil - Mombi had tried to turn her into a Wicked Witch, but her innate goodness was too great to turn wicked, and so she became a Good Witch instead.

   Ironically, though Mombi's vengeance upon Orin initially seemed to be an effective one, it ultimately turned out to be her own downfall, for as the good witch Tattypoo, Orin was more powerful than she - Mombi - was, powerful enough, in fact, to depose her as Ruler of the Gillikins.
