    The Oz Film Manufacturing Company
   </b>
   was one of the first movie studios in Hollywood, releasing its first picture in 1914. It was established by
   the Uplifters
   , a social club of businessmen and performers that met at the Los Angeles Athletic Club. Writer
   <a href="L. Frank Baum.html" key="8a17f3c0-b1db-4f56-bcd0-9f6dc77c357f" title="L. Frank Baum">

   was president, and composer
   Louis F. Gottschalk
   was vice-president. Baum and Gottschalk received stock in the firm for their non-monetary contributions: Baum provided the film rights to his books, and Gottschalk composed music for the productions. The other investors raised $100,000. The new company purchased a seven-acre plot of land and built what was then considered the most advanced movie studio in the country, equipped for turning out special-effects-heavy Oz fantasies.

   film

   The commercial disappointments of the three Oz films meant that the company's later offerings were shunned by distributors, which led to the firm's collapse. In a last-gasp move, Baum turned the firm over to his son,
   Frank Joslyn Baum
   , who changed its name to Dramatic Features Co. Yet the company's final effort, a war movie titled

    The Gray Nun of Belgium

   , Baum invested none of his own money in the Oz Film company. Yet he was intensely active in the company's efforts. The films variously credit him as producer and writer, though evidence suggests that he was working on every level, from the most exalted to the humblest.
