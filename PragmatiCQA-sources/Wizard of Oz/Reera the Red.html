   Since Reera employs her transformational abilities on herself, her original form might be considered an open question. Yet her sobriquet "the red" derives from her red hair in her human form, which implies that that form is natural to her. If so, she is a "quite attractive" young woman. She cannot be accused of vanity, since she transforms herself into a gray ape in preference to her human form. (The ape form allows her to be free of clothing during the heat of the day.)

   She keeps a small menagerie of pets, which she changes into different forms with her magic.

   Reera prefers isolation to human contact, though she is not overtly hostile to people. She is not devoid of humor and irony. Her words can be more negative than her deeds.
