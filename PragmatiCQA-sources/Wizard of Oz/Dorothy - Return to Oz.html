   Shortly after returning to Kansas, Dorothy fell in love with a man named Jones (later known as Doc Jones), however in 1950 he was conscripted to military service in the Korean War. In Jones' absence, she met a man named Roy, and they were married. Roy agreed to take her surname Gale as his own. Their son Ed Gale (born in the 1950s) married a woman named Linda, and had a daughter, Dorothy Gale II, who was born in 1981. Roy Gale died sometime before 1993, and Doc Jones began attempting to court Dorothy Gale I again. While she still had fondness for him, she determined never to remarry until she had determined the identity of her birth parents.

   Meanwhile in Oz, a man named Ura Wizard, the son of the original Wizard of Oz, became ruler of the land. About the same age as Dorothy Gale I, he was a competent and benevolent administrator, ruling better than his father did. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion, heroes of Oz, lived happy lives and died of old age. In the early 1990s, an evil threat to Ura's security arose in the form of Ima Witch, the self-proclaimed Wicked Witch of the North. She was the daughter of the late Wicked Witch of the West.

   In 1993, Dorothy Gale II of Orlando, Florida is told that her father Ed Gale has lost his job at a local defense plant. The family plans to relocate to Detroit, Michigan. In preparation for this development, Dorothy is sent to live over the summer with her grandmother, Dorothy Gale I, commonly known as Grandma D, in Osawatomie, Kansas. This is to the distress of Dorothy, who would much rather stay with her friend Rita Thomas at the beach.
  </p>
  <p key="40cfe85f-de42-4120-b8cd-94db7726b972">
   Meanwhile, Grandma D is awaiting Dorothy's arrival. The news from Oz tells her that "The Wizard Needs Dorothy," yet the Ruby Slippers refuse to oblige. Doc Jones is in love with Grandma D, but she insists that she is too old to be married again. The local government is threatening to seize Ozcot for non-payment of taxes. Grandma D has been having nightmares about Ima Witch, the evil woman who is threatening Ura Wizard's life. Ima is always accompanied by her pet reptile, Itsa Dragon. At one point, Ima takes Ura prisoner. She also devises a way of spying on Grandma D's attic through the crystal snow shaker ball.
  </p>
  <p key="2fdf744e-7ab3-4438-9b93-d34be3e162aa">
   Grandma D and Doc Jones interact with young citizens of Osawatomie, close to her granddaughter's age. Alexander Beam, a frail bespectacled "bookworm," helps her with her inventions. Jessie Lee, a paperboy, seems like a nice young man, but has a habit of cheating his customers by insisting on a nonexistent 10-cent "carrying charge" for delivery. John Bear is a local bully who picks fights with other boys (including Jessie); it is believed that he is channeling resent from his parents' impending divorce. A beautiful but mean-spirited widow, Willa Watkins, formerly of Detroit, Michigan, is the wealthiest person in town. She seeks to own Ozcot by means honest or otherwise, in order to build a new subdivision; her unpleasant personality causes locals to think of her as a "witch". Ima, who has found new spy portals to Kansas, notices a strong resemblance between herself and Willa.
  </p>
  <p key="dea79cf8-b579-4a6b-9b78-fbc924958cdf">
   Young Dorothy arrives in town, chauffeured by Doc Jones. Ima Witch begins speaking through the crystal ball, using an incantation to turn some attic mice into local rats, however Dorothy is not enticed by the trap Ima sets. Ura Wizard makes a futile show of defiance against his captor, and hopes that Dorothy will return. Ima threatens to open Oz up to all visitors from
   America
   and other countries, which would reduce the proud land to a theme park.
  </p>
  <p key="03e3e6e6-b7e6-4c00-b005-798f0e876fd7">
   However, Ura has concealed on his person the Golden Ruler, a powerful tool of benevolent magic. He wills the ruler to travel to the rainbow, where Ima cannot touch it. Ima is furious, but decides not to kill Ura, who is more valuable to her as a hostage.

  <p key="670aa55e-90c9-4cdd-8cf4-298e8aeff1df">
   Meanwhile, Willa Watkins purchases the foreclosed Ozcot. When the sheriff says that Grandma D was sent four notices about foreclosure, Doc says that D never received any, and begins to suspect treachery. Just as the foreclosure is about to be served, a tornado begins, unprecedented since 1933. Grandma D shows Dorothy her Ozian artifacts, including the newspaper which reads "Dorothy Must Come Back to Oz" and reports Ura's captivity. Dorothy urges Grandma D to use the Slippers for the purpose of return, but Grandma D gives them to Dorothy instead, deciding that Dorothy, rather than Grandma D, is the one who must save Oz this time.

   After overcoming Ima's magical interference, Dorothy manages to activate the Slippers and travels, with little Ozzie the dog, to a rainbow bridge. Awaiting her is a woman named Mother Rainbow, who tells her she must go to Oz and rescue Ura Wizard. Mother Rainbow hands the Golden Ruler to Dorothy, telling her she must deliver it to Ura. She reports that Ima Witch has stolen the

   Dorothy lands in Oz, and meets a sentient plant called G.V., or Grape Vine, who is a news reporter and determined to achieve television stardom alongside Rush Limbaugh and Oprah Winfrey. He and Dorothy travel to meet the Billikins, sentient small stone statues who claim to be the Conscience of Oz, and are all of nonbinary gender. Ima attacks, and Dorothy uses the Golden Ruler as a club to fight off Ima and protect the Billikins; a result of this good deed is that the ruler shrinks from 12 inches to 11.
  </p>
  <p key="353a5f13-451a-40c8-9fd5-4302c9ecc152">
   In a small town called Georgetown, where every citizen is named George, Dorothy meets Paper Boy, a young man literally made out of papier-maché, in order to buy an updated Oz newspaper. Paper Boy has the same bad habit of price-gouging as Jessie Lee (and implicitly looks like him too). Ultimately, Dorothy taps his shoulder with the Golden Ruler. Paper Boy admits his misdeeds, and renounces his deceitful ways, at which point the Ruler shrinks again.
  </p>
  <p key="6615bf6b-bfa2-41a3-bab5-879a0584b6c9">
   With Paper Boy added to their number, Dorothy's band set out again for the Emerald City. A worm with an anthropomorphic torso named Book Worm (who implicitly resembles Alexander Beam) is recruited to the cause, after Dorothy uses up another Ruler inch by curing him of his habit of telling lies to inflate his reputation. Terrifyingly, the party is attacked by Ima Witch's fire. Ura is able to work a counter-magic that sends rain, but this causes Paper Boy to begin disintegrating. Ura stops the rain just in time, and Ima is left without an advantage.
  </p>
  <p key="101b94e4-9a0f-4797-baa7-9c723ddf5cc8">
   The next traveling recruit is Bully Bear, an anthropomorphic ursine who shares all the personality traits of John Bear from Kansas. But while he talks fearfully, he cannot abide actually hurting anybody. An inch of the Ruler helps him confess his misdeeds. But then, a trap set by Ima snares Paper Boy, and she holds him hostage with the Ruler as the price of his freedom.
  </p>
  <p key="3099152a-8ca5-43e5-b8ce-a58b41cc044b">
   On the way to rescue Paper Boy, Dorothy uses another Ruler inch when she gives away the Ruby Slippers to a wheelchair-bound girl in order to send the girl to a "land without barriers." Bully Bear and Book Worm are captured by Ima's minions. Dorothy and Grape Vine manage to enter Ima's territory. Dorothy resists the illusory images of her parents which Ima set up to ensnare her. Defying the gauntlet of witch minions, Dorothy manages to find the prison cells of her friends and Ura Wizard. When Ima catches Dorothy and demands the Ruler, Dorothy whacks Ima's hand with it, causing her glamour disguise, which gave her a young and beautiful semblance, to disintegrate, leaving behind an ugly, wrinkled hag. This deed, and Dorothy's subsequent liberation of additional hostages, use up more Ruler inches. Paper Boy manages to reconfigure himself into a paper airplane to carry away the entire party, and they set off toward the rainbow bridge, with Ima Witch and Itsa Dragon in hot pursuit. Mother Rainbow comes to the rescue, and Ima is left impotently shouting "I'll get you, Dorothy Gale! You're not through with the Wicked Witch yet!"
  </p>
  <p key="03830afc-865c-4c5e-914e-7ce7c57c804d">
   The friends all arrive at the Emerald City, where Dorothy is hailed as the Wizard's rescuer. Her traveling friends tell how she helped each one overcome his bad habits. When Dorothy tells that she is worried about Grandma D's farm, Grape Vine researches an obscure Kansas law that says if it can be proven that D did not receive her notice, then the confiscation will be rescinded. He then shows photographs (obtained by magic) of Willa Watkins stealing tax notices from Grandma D's mailbox. Ura Wizard inexplicably has a copy of Grandma D's birth certificate which identifies her birth parents. Dorothy realizes that her good deeds have used up the Golden Ruler completely, but the Wizard restores it to full length, and Paper Boy (back in airplane mode) speeds her on to the rainbow bridge. Mother Rainbow sends her home to Kansas.

   Dorothy awakes in Kansas with Grandma D, Doc Jones, and Ozzie by her bed. She is told that she was knocked out by the tornado. Grandma D reports that the sheriff received evidence incriminating Willa Watkins, so the farm is restored to Grandma D. The latter's birth certificate has also arrived, telling the names of her parents, who died in an accident when she was an infant, so now Grandma D is willing to marry Doc. Dorothy's father Ed phones to tell her that his old plant has opened up again, so the family can stay living in Orlando. Ed deduces that his daughter has found Oz. Dorothy resolves to visit Kansas again next year, then looks up at the sky and sees a rainbow which she believes stretches to Oz.

   Pop cultural references indicate that the novel is set in 1993, meaning that Grandma D was born in 1921. However, a large part of her backstory is that she remained unmarried until after the onset of the Korean War (1950-1953). In 20th-century Kansas, it was nearly unthinkable for a "respectable" girl to remain unmarried too far beyond her 20th year. Similarly, the custom of a man taking his wife's surname at marriage was practically unheard of in the same culture. (The latter element was mandated by the story, simply because a plot point requires grandmother and granddaughter to have the same name.)

   daughter found it funny and exciting, while he did not. He found it derivative and unoriginal, with a plethora of plot and character points plagiarized from the 1939 movie. He also criticized the lack of illustrations (beyond the "uninspired" cover image of the Yellow Brick Road on a green background), the heavy-handed preaching of the "Golden Ruler" moral, and the slow dramatic pacing of the first act. He noted the irony that Tedrow in his introductory essay claims to be a devout fan of all of Baum's Oz work, yet the novel contains no allusion to any Baum character beyond those introduced in the original novel, nor any of Baum's trademark wit. However, he praised the character of Paper Boy as the novel's most memorable invention.
