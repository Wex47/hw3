    Blinkie
    was another wicked witch who lived in
    Jinxland
    . Blinkie was the leader of all the other Jinxland witches, and therefore the most hated and feared. She is called "Blinkie" because she lost one eye and wears a black patch over it. She froze the heart of
    Gloria
    and was well-paid by King Krewl and his courtier
    Googly-Goo
    . But when King Krewl was deposed by the

    , Blinkie was quickly captured. The Scarecrow sprinkled a shrinking powder on her, and would not give her the antidote until she righted the wrongs she had committed. By the time the grasshopper was transformed back into
    Cap'n Bill
    and Gloria's heart was defrosted, Blinkie was no taller than the Scarecrow's knee. He gave her the antidote to the shrinking powder, which also contained a compound that deprived her of all her magic powers. Since she was then harmless, the Scarecrow sent her home.
