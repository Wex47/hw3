   and constitutes a notable contribution to the mythology of Christmas.

   "A Kidnapped Santa Claus" was published two years after Baum's novel on Santa Claus, and shares its mythological cosmos. In the story as in the novel, Santa lives in the
   Laughing Valley
   on the border of the Forest of
   Burzee
   , and is assisted by
   Knooks
   ,
   Ryls
   ,
   Fairies
   , and Pixies. In modern editions the two works, novel and short story, are sometimes published together.
  </p>
  <p key="3da201f0-ddd0-4084-80e6-8167ce73a94d">
   Though the short story has strong similarities with the novel, it has been interpreted as presenting "a less rosy view" of the world,
   in that it shows elements of evil as fundamental to existence, and ineradicable.

  <p key="2a42db35-0654-4870-8534-b89be0e77f05">
   The story opens with a quick overview of Santa's castle in the Laughing Valley. Its focus soon switches to the five
   Caves of the Daemons
   in nearby (though unnamed) mountains. The Daemons  of
   Selfishness
   ,
   Envy
   ,
   Hatred
   , and
   Malice
   resent Santa because children under the influence of his gifts rarely visit their caves. They want to frustrate his efforts and counter his influence. (The
   Daemon of Repentance
   goes along with their plan, since children cannot reach his remote cavern without passing through the prior caves of his compatriots.) The Daemons first try to tempt Santa to their own vices; they visit him one by one, and attempt to lure him into selfishness, envy, and hatred. Santa merely laughs at their clumsy efforts. Failing at temptation, the Daemons kidnap Santa instead, lassoing him as he rides in his sleigh on Christmas Eve and binding him in their caverns.
  </p>
  <p key="2c0a2877-0b64-4b42-acb4-47b6fd7a63db">
   Santa Claus is accompanied on his rounds by a fairy, pixie, knook, and ryl, who travel under the seat of his sleigh. Once the four realize that Santa is gone, they endeavor to complete his mission and deliver the gifts. They generally succeed, though with some mistakes: they send a toy drum to a little girl and a sewing kit to a little boy. Overall, though, they manage to save Christmas.
  </p>
  <p key="040417eb-339a-4891-b9d4-b05f694e2728">
   Then they report Santa's absence; the
   fairy queen
   of Burzee understands what has happened. An army of magical creatures is mustered to rescue the missing hero. Meanwhile, though, Santa is released from captivity by the Daemon of Repentance, who has repented the kidnapping. Santa meets the army on its way, and turns it back from attacking the daemons.

   The Daemons of the story as pagan figures rather than Christian demons, in that they are not servants of Satan or necessaily evil. Four of the five, the Daemons of Sefishness, Envy, Hatred, and Malice, certainly are bad, but the fifth, the Daemon of Repentance, is a more ambiguous entity.
  </p>
  <p key="8404cac6-4353-4fbb-901d-5aa78ccc804b">
   The obvious model for the Daemon's temptation of Santa is the Temptation of Christ in the Synoptic Gospels (an interesting mix of Christian and pagan elements in one story).
