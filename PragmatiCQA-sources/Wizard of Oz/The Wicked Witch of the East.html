   One day, a Munchkin woodman by the name of
   Nick Chopper
   had promised the beautiful maid of the Wicked Witch of the East who was also his secret lover, named
   Nimmie Amee
   , that he would chop down many trees to build her a pretty, comfortable home, and when the house was finished they would marry and elope by running away together to live happily ever after and away from the all their troubles. Thus, Nimmie Amee would be a servant no more. The Wicked Witch however, being a cunning creature, happened to eavesdrop on the two lovers making their escape plans. And since the the Wicked Witch was a rather lazy one, she was determined to prevent her servant from leaving her. Among her exceedingly cruel actions was the evil enchantment of Nick Chopper's handy axe which caused him to cut off all the limbs of his own body and eventually turn into the

Whatever magic was holding her together must have been something she needed to keep doing to stay alive as she was said to be so old that just like the Wicked Witch of the West, the blood in her body dried up long ago. In the film versions, instead of crumbling away, her feet slowly roll up into her legs like a giant party horn. Dorothy obtained her magical Silver Shoes which was all that was left behind.

The book begins with her summoning a magical hurricane to destroy all humanity (since people, in her opinion, exterminate her food). However, Villina learns of her schemes, and changes the spell to only affect one house (her magic book told her it was always empty during storms) and drop it on Gingema's head. Unlike in Baum's books, while being the formal ruler of the Munchkins, she interfered little in their lives, and only demanded that people collect food for her. Since her food was snakes, leeches, spiders, and other similarly disgusting creatures which the Munchkins were afraid of, that was nevertheless a heavy burden for them.

In both the book and musical, the character is portrayed in a less negative light than in the Baum books or earlier movie, although she becomes fanatical, (something of a religious "nut-job" in the books and desperately and manipulatively dependent on the munchkin Boq in musicals) so much so that she limits the rights of the

   East seemingly died by being hit by a police car when Dorothy arrived in Oz, but survived the impact in death-like stupor. Once she woke up, she wanted to take revenge on Dorothy as she woke up 'with a strange taste in her mouth' - Dorothy. She found the girl on the Brick Road and went on to torment her by imprisoning her mind in the Prison of the Abject.

   This is eventually revealed to have been Dorothy in disguise, though it remains unclear how Dorothy knew how to disguise herself, given that in the film preceding the series she never actually saw her face, only briefly her feet before they shriveled up, leaving the ruby slippers behind.

   East is still dead (though Ozma avoids using the word, saying "y'know" instead) but her spirit is able to partly solidify so long as West wears the silver slippers. East however wants to regain her ruby slippers to fully return to life permanently, due to her special bond with them.

   In 2007, Turner Entertainment collaborated with Madame Alexander to create a series of McDonald's Happy Meal toys centered on the main characters from the 1939 movie, one of which was the Wicked Witch of the East. She is depicted as having blonde hair, a red shirt with a green belt and a burgundy dress over her distinguishable striped stockings and ruby slippers. She also is wearing a hat similar to the Witch of the West's, although it is colored red.
