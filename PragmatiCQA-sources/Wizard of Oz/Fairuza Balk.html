   had given the role to Balk because she captured the essence of the character without trying to be a copycat version of Garland, while other girls who also auditioned for the part were discarded for trying to be as close as possible to Garland's portrayal of Dorothy which came off as cheesy and insincere. Balk was so much younger and posh looking compared to Garland but was cast well for the movie because in actuality, there was a kind of a uniqueness and darkness to Balk that ended up working for the darker tones in the film which helped it become the "cult classic" it is today.
