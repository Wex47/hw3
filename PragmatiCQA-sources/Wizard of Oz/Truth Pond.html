   The Truth Pond is surrounded by a circle of trees just far enough apart that their thick branches touch. The water in the pond is crystal clear and still as glass.

   The Truth Pond has the power to break unwanted enchantments, reverting transformations to their true forms. A side effect is that anyone who bathes in the Truth Pond is compelled ever afterward to tell the truth.

   Similarly, when Button-Bright and the Shaggy Man visited the Truth Pond, the only signage noted was a silver plate with the words "THE TRUTH POND", fastened to a rock just below the surface of the water; later, when the Frogman visited, the silver plate had been replaced with a golden plate above the water's surface, with the more detailed inscription:
