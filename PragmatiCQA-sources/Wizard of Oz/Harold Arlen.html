   He was born Hyman Arluck, the son of a cantor; he dropped out of high school to work as a pianist. He also sang professionally. His songwriting career began when he was 24 years old: lyricist Ted Koehler put words to an Arlen tune to create "Get Happy." Arlen first worked with Harburg on the 1934 Broadway review
