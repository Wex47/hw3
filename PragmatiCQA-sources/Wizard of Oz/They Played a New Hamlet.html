    "They Played a New Hamlet"
   </b>
   is a short story written by
   <a href="L. Frank Baum.html" key="985bbb17-b4fa-4918-bcca-a5e2df52c072" title="L. Frank Baum">
    L. Frank Baum
   </a>
   . It originally appeared in the 28 April 1895 edition of
   <i key="dc63bf46-c76d-4e83-8afd-7fd8580ffa8c">
    The Chicago Times-Herald
   </i>
   newspaper, and is generally recognized as Baum's earliest piece of professionally-published fiction now known.

   (Baum had published a range of materials in previous years, but on an amateur or self-published basis. His earlier work included at least one substantial work of fiction,

    Our Landlady
   </i>
   , which appeared serially in his

   — yet since Baum edited and published that newspaper, the printing of
   <i key="2ad06628-e2ba-4c0d-a2f1-122dc17f320c">
    Our Landlady
   </i>
   was another form of self-publication. "They Played a New Hamlet," in contrast, conformed to the normal pattern of commercial publication: Baum submitted a work to a publisher, had it accepted, and received payment for it.)

   In this story, Baum drew upon his own theater background to create a richly comic picture of actors behind the scenes.
