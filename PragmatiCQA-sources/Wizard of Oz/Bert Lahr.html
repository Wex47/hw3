   Lahr's contract with MGM specified a salary of $2500 per week, and involved haggling over its minimum duration: MGM offered five weeks of employment, while Lahr held out for, and won, a minimum of six weeks. In fact, he was employed at that salary for the several months of the film shoot.

   Lahr's costume for the role of the Cowardly Lion (made from a genuine lion's skin) was famously hot and uncomfortable. It weighed over fifty pounds; the actor sweated profusely under the hot lights needed for filming in

   The costume's facial prosthetic kept Lahr from eating as long as he wore it; he drank soup through a straw. Yet the costume was a vast improvement over earlier treatments. (In the films of

   , actors playing animals wore full-head masks like sports mascots at college football games.) At first, the makers of the MGM film had not been sure how to realize the Cowardly Lion character; their solution allowed Lahr to give a funny and touching performance.

   Lahr improvised the line "Unusual weather we're havin', ain't it?" in the poppy field scene of the film.
