   "Born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, March 4, 1887. Her first theatrical engagement was one season, playing soubrette parts, with Stella Mayhew, following which she took the part of the original Girl in The Time, the Place and the Girl company for three seasons. Some other of Miss MacMillan's stage experiences consist of an engagement playing Dorothy in Mr. Baum's company of Wizard of Oz ; two seasons with Klaw &amp; Erlanger, playing opposite Max Rodgers and Joseph Cawthorn, and two years in vaudeville, closing her route on the Orpheum circuit June 1, 1914, in order to go into the Oz Film Company as leading lady for the Baum fairy tale productions. Miss MacMillan is now being starred in the Magic Clock of Oz, playing the part of King Bud. Miss MacMillan is of the extreme blond type and an actress of exceptional ability, and is more than satisfied with her change to the silent drama."
