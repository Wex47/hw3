   Baum continued to revise and rewrite his show. He did not find a theater producer for the project until 1912, when Oliver Morosco agreed to stage the work. The play premiered on 31 March 1913 at Morosco's Majestic Theater in Los Angeles. The principals were Leonora Novasio as

   Baum was disappointed that the show did not continue on to New York. Morosco was perhaps preoccupied and distracted by his New York production of
