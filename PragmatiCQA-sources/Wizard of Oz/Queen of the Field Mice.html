   Since the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman were not made of flesh and blood like their other three comrades, the poison of the poppies did not effect them. Therefore when they saw their friends had fallen victim to these flowers, the two made it their mission to save the sleeping trio. Dorothy and Toto were light enough for the Strawman and Tinman to carry out of the poppy field; taken to safety and placed on a nearby meadow of rich green grass that helped the spell of the flowers wear off. The Lion however,

   was much too big and heavy to be carried out like the girl and her dog, so the Strawman and Tinman had to leave him behind to sleep on forever. All they could do was wish for their doomed friend  to hopefully dream of finally finding his courage at last. Just as it seemed all hope was lost, a mean and hungry
   Wildcat
   ran past them and who was ruthlessly chasing a poor little mouse to make as its snack. The Tin Woodman saw this and out of compassion for the mouse, chopped off the Wildcat's head clean off with his handy axe to save the mouse.

   The little cute mouse politely introduced herself as the Queen. And as a sincere thank you, she and her loyal mouse subjects were obliged to assist the two in anyway. The rodents lived in a nearby underground kingdom below the ground and because of their tiny size, the poison of the poppies did not effect them at all. So the rodents offered to help successfully rescue the Cowardly Lion from the sleep-inducing

   (2011), by James C. Wallace II, the Queen of the Field Mice has a short, but amusing encounter with the Kalidahs, who serve as bodyguards for the Cowardly Lion when he chooses to move his court south to Emerald City. During the fiery rampage of Cobbler the Dog, a mechanical pet built by H.M. Wogglebug, T.E. for Tik-Tok, the home of the Field Mice is burned away and the Queen and her subjects barely escape the flames. She then sends a mouse messenger, by means of the Lonesome Duck, to O.Z. Diggs to inform him of their plight. They join forces with the Army of Playing Cards to battle and defeat Cobbler the Dog by the banks of the Munchkin River.
