   A local church is being decorated for Easter; the town's children gather flowers for the purpose. A little boy named Bob is distressed that he has none to bring; his mother is a poor laundress, without the time or space for a flower garden. The laundress sends her son to the fields outside town, to gather the daisies and buttercups that grow wild there; but it is too early in the season for the flowers to have blossomed. Disappointed, Bob gives way to tears — and discovers that a second creature weeps with him. He meets a
   ryl
   , who is distraught about his lilies. The ryl has a field of lilies growing in Brazil, but lacks one natural ingredient to give them their characteristic yellow stamens. Bob offers to help, if he can; and the ryl asks for a blue bottle of plant food stored in Bob's house. (There are rules against ryls asking help from humans; but they can accept aid if it is offered freely.)
  </p>
  <p key="3da4b856-356e-4ac6-80b4-9c08a2be431f">
   The ryl takes the bottle and transports himself and Bob magically to Brazil. The missing ingredient does its job quickly; for a reward, the ryl heaps Bob's arms with fresh-picked lilies in bloom. The parishioners at home are amazed, and consider the flowers an Easter miracle.

   knooks

   fairies
   , that are significant in Baum's fantasy world.

   When they first meet, the ryl instructs Bob on the differences among creatures: the ryl points out that he lacks the wings and golden hair of a fairy, and the distended body, toothpick legs, and saucer-sized eyes of a brownie. The ryl comes nattily dressed, in green and yellow striped trousers, a red top hat, and a lavender necktie.

   It can be noted that Baum tells this story simply, without irony. The Christian minister who appears in it is presented as sincere and tolerant; compare "
   <a href="The Strange Adventures of an Easter Egg.html" key="d2abc3ab-c883-4cc9-aa27-82cfeaec13f5" title="The Strange Adventures of an Easter Egg">

  <p key="935d08d9-a0bb-41c1-bc5e-cb7e707aba2a">
   The original publication date of this story is significant because it predates the introduction of
   Ryls
   in Baum's novel
   The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus
   .
