   The Golden Cap is a strange and unique-looking hat made of soft yellow velvet and fine golden silk, with a beautiful brim of solid gold that circled around the entire cap to make it sturdy and wearable. On this brim was a circle of sparkling diamonds and red rubies.

   The enchantment held within it is a special charm that is only invoked by the following incantation, which is written inside the cap that one must shout out loud for it to properly work.

One fateful day, the group of Winged Monkeys who were mischievous troublemakers, loving to play and horse around, played a trick on Quelala only all in innocent fun by dropping him in a river and getting him  soaking wet on Princess Gayelette's wedding day. Now Gayelette wasn't just any average pretty princess, she also was also a great Sorceress who was talented in practicing the magic arts of Witchcraft. When she found out what the Monkeys did to her soon to be husband on her big day, she became infuriated and punished them by making them eternal slaves to the Golden Cap that was meant to be a gift for Quelala who happened to be the first owner of the Golden Cap. He then commanded the Winged Monkeys to stay away from Gayelette and the royal kingdom they lived in so they would not upset Gayelette ever again. The Monkeys were all banished from the place Gayelette ruled over and were never allowed to come back.
