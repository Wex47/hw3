    "The Diamondback"
   </b>
   is a short story by
   <a href="L. Frank Baum.html" key="254a5325-a464-4fef-8433-b02e0fae14bf" title="L. Frank Baum">
    L. Frank Baum
   </a>
   . It is one of his rare animal fables that was not published in his lifetime; discovered in the Baum papers with its first page missing, the surviving portion was printed in
   <i key="b4085fc3-a4b7-4329-b6b5-0ae0483b0632">
    The Baum Bugle
   </i>
   in 1982.

   Baum's correspondence shows that he did try to sell the story to magazines. Biographer
   Katharine Rogers
   considers it unsurprising that "The Diamondback" failed in the contemporaneous marketplace; she characterizes it as "a strange though powerful story, narrated by a sympathetic rattlesnake," that shows that all animals are subject to intense suffering.

   "The Diamondback" can be compared to "
   The Tiger's Eye
   ," another dark animal fable by Baum that was not printed in the author's era.
