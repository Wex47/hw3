   Hamilton's film career began in 1933, when she recreated her Broadway role in the movie version of
   . By the time she was cast as the Wicked Witch, she had already made 25 films. She  worked more than many actors in her day, because she freelanced instead of signing a studio contract, and cleverly kept her salary below $1000 per week.
   She had previously played the Witch onstage in two community theater productions.

   On December 23rd, 1938, while filming the Wicked Witch's exit from Munchkinland in a blaze of fire, Hamilton suffered first-degree burns on the right side of her face and second-degree burns on her right hand; the flames rose too soon, before she had descended below the stage. Hamilton's green makeup was copper-based and potentially toxic, and had to be removed from her burned flesh with alcohol, an intensely painful process. She wasn't able to return to the movie until February 10. When she did return, she wore green gloves, since her hand was not yet fully healed.

   Hamilton's infamous Witch's laugh blew out sound equipment circuits. For several weeks after she completed work on her role, Hamilton's complexion retained a green tinge from the Witch's makeup.

   When the film was previewed for test audiences in June 1939, Hamilton's performance as the Witch was perceived as too frightening. In a letter dated 16 July,

   's granddaughter Florence wrote to
   Ruth Plumly Thompson
   about a preview three weeks earlier: "It was very good, although the Witch was so terrifying that some small children had to be taken out." The final edit of the film removed a least a dozen lines of the Witch's dialogue to tone down her effect.

   Hamilton appeared in an episode of
   Sesame Street
   which aired February 10th, 1976, reprising her role as the Wicked Witch of the West from The Wizard of Oz (1939).

As a result of the overwhelming reaction, this episode never re-aired.  Sesame Workshop (successor to CTW) still has the episode in it's archives and seven minutes of the episode were shown in 2019.
