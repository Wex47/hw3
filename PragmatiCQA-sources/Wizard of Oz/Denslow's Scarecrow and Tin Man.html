   The format is not a comic strip in the modern sense, but more of a short story with full-page illustrations. The plot involves the three bumbling heroes having misadventures in the
   United States of America
   , where their presence is overseen by a vaguely defined "fairy godfather." They also briefly visit Mexico, and have an extended stay in Bermuda, where Denslow had his winter estate. Denslow gives his own likeness to a number of incidental characters, including a streetcar conductor and a ship captain.

   Denslow's gifts as an artist were undeniable, but he was less capable as an author. His strip was in direct competition with the more popular
