   's series, the analogue of the Water is called "Soporific Water". It used to come once a month from an underground spring, after the spring was accidentally destroyed, it was remade into a well. The water puts a person into an enchanted sleep, virtually indistinguishable from death. The duration of the sleep is in proportion to the amount of water drunk. Even the vapors of the water can cause the effect (this can be slowed down by physical contact with diamonds).

   After waking up, the amnesia is even more complete than in Baum's books; the person's mind is that of a newborn baby. However, the memories can be restored over the course of a few days. Also, false memories could be implanted, which was used to reeducate a large amount of parasites at one point, as well as at least one outright criminal. The water lost its qualities after one day, in a well stoppered bottle, it maintained limited effects for at least three days. Then, the effects includes no memory loss, and only a few hours' sleep. Interestingly, even in that case, the sleep was also shown to cure at least one type of drug addiction.

   drew, perhaps unwittingly, on a rich store of folklore and legend. The idea of a drink that purges memories can be found in Norse and Hindu and other world mythologies.
