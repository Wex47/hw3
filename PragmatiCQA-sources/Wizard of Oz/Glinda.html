   . She also dressed in accordance with her high authority -

   in Oz, though other illustrations have also depicted her in either light pink, or dark pink, or dark red (the color of the Southern Quadlings). While her dress' color varied, its style and Glinda's incredible natural beauty always coupled harmoniously to make her look every inch a vision, like a Goddess of Snow, or a Goddess of Mercy and Purity. she was also the most fabulous, most beautiful, and most divine of all Virgos.

   Glinda's spirit is just as beautiful as her outside physical appearance. She remains calm and collected even in the most chaotic of situations. She is soft spoken and speaks with truth, dignity and concern for others. She is a very compassionate, graceful and unselfish ruler who is loved by all who know her. Glinda is the wisest of the wise and a figure who values her privacy. Glinda is patient and displays acts of selflessness and kindness while expecting little in return.
  </p>
  <p key="dae55c28-c05a-4f9a-b632-4a232f9bf666">
   She is "always kindly and helpful and willing to listen to... troubles, however busy she may be."

   Baum's Glinda reads as a mastermind. She is highly intelligent and dedicated to Oz. Glinda rarely ever needs any help when it comes to defending herself. In the books she is much more assertive, hands-on and dominant compared to her movie counterpart. Glinda is frequently the one who is rescuing Oz, though only interferes when absolutely necessary.
  </p>
  <p key="51b9f1b2-b2e3-4e93-b9ba-a1161952f677">
   She encourages female empowerment and independence, which was uncommon for the era in which the story was first told. Glinda is portrayed as a role model for girls to aspire to be like and is a force to be reckoned with.
  </p>
  <p key="91ceef5a-a3c6-4fde-8bba-8131cacf0613">
   Glinda occasionally exhibits a more ruthless, cunning side than her counterparts or companions. She threatens the wicked witch Mombi with death when questioning her, though she insists the threat is a false one.
   Her tactic when surrounding a beseiged Emerald City is to "lay siege to the city, and starve it into submission." She says this is the "only thing to do".
  </p>
  <p key="1989590c-4d95-4475-aa2b-014c7435d797">
   Glinda demonstrates her commitment to honesty and truth when explaining she does not practice the magic of transformations, considering them to be deceitful.

   One origin for Glinda says that she was once an ordinary woman in the days before Oz was an enchanted land. She was old then and considered ugly by the cruel King Oz, thus causing him to brand her a witch. She was thrown into prison with another falsely accused woman, who revealed she had previously encountered the fairy queen Lurline. After days and nights of chanting like the witches they were accused of being, the two were able to summon Lurline, who revealed her plans to enchant Oz and make them genuine witches. Glinda was then allowed to escape and was given refuge by Dr. Majestico, a scientist whom King Oz believed to be a wizard and was too afraid to cross. Sometime later, King Oz drank from the Fountain of Oblivion and forgot his cruelty, allowing the enchantment that swept through Oz a moment later to make it a beautiful fairy land. Glinda became a true witch after that and her inner goodness caused her to become young and beautiful. The other women who escaped became witches as well, though some went against Lurline's wishes and became the infamous Wicked Witches whom Dorothy and co. encountered. While considered non-canon, this explanation is one of the first real accounts of an origin story for the Witches of Oz.

   Yet another take on Glinda appears in Tarl Teleford's Hidden History Of Oz series. Here, she is introduced as a young sixteen year old under pressure to live up to her mother, the Ruby Sorceress Gayelette, while establishing her own identity. She is soon pushed into a grand adventure when four Wicked Witches declare war on Oz and usurp her mother's secrets. This version of Glinda is notable for not being centuries old though her mother is at least a hundred and the Wicked Witches are much older than her.

She had been born in New York City before moving to Greenwich Connecticut and studying as archeologist at a university in Manhattan. She was digging in Africa and was flying a single occupant plane in order for a doctor to treat her dysentery.  Although the other witches couldn't cure her, Mombi despite being a zombie intent on making people undead gave her the silver boots akin to slippers and helped her create ruby ones after the first pair was stolen by Gayelette. She occasionally uses them to travel between both worlds bringing jewels back from Oz to give to her family who have no idea where she really goes off to. As a cover story, she claimed that she married a Maharaja.

    In "Tinman" TV miniseries Queen Lavender-Eyes The former ruler of the OZ, Lavender-Eyes is based on Glinda, the Good Witch of the South. She is the mother of Azkadellia and DG, and wife of Ahamo. Various flashbacks show her on her pavilion in Finaqua, a beautiful lakeland where she used to take DG and "Az" when they were children. When Azkadellia becomes possessed by the spirit of the Evil Witch of the Dark, Azkadellia organizes a rebellion against her mother and seizes the throne for herself. She then imprisons Lavender-Eyes on a barren island in the middle of the ocean and leaves her there. Azkadellia occasionally comes to visit Lavender-Eyes, usually to mock her and sometimes to torture her by making torrential downpour fall upon her. Azkadellia can teleport to and from the island at whim by clapping her hands, and she is able to observe it at any time through a magical glass dome in her palace. Azkadellia seems to hate Lavender-Eyes passionately. She plans to allow Lavender-Eyes to live until the day when she can "see her hope die", and relishes mocking her mother, even making a point of telling her that DG is dead. Nevertheless, Lavender-Eyes never gives up hope that Azkadellia is not beyond redemption.When DG arrives at the pavilion where she used to sit with her mother when she was child she finds a holographic recording of Lavender-Eyes telling her to go the Land of the Unwanted and find her father, Ahamo. Lavender-Eyes is later reunited with Ahamo byAzkadellia, but only so that she can taunt and eventually kill them. When Azkadellia is freed from the Evil Witch that possesses her and reverts to her previous benevolent self, Lavender-Eyes stands with her, DG, and Ahamo and watches the suns rise in the distance. It is also worth mentioning that Lavender-Eyes is never stated to be the Queen's actual name. She is referred to as the Queen throughout the series but she is named as "Lavender-Eyes" in the ending credits. Glitch at one point tries to remember her name but cannot.

    Emerald City: Glinda is one of the Cardinal Witches of Oz, known as the Maiden of the Northern Light, Mother of the Sound and Pure. She is the Witch of the North just like the 1939 film but the character of the Witch of the South, nominally Glinda in the books, is a separate entity in the series. There's a mention of Mother South, a Cardinal Witch who is said to have been killed by the Beast Forever, implied to be the mother of the other three witches. At the start of the series she arrives to the Emerald City to put her fallen sister, East, to rights in the Sacred Temple. The Temple has been sealed by the Wizard before, and has a giant statue of a warrior, an Eternal Warrior, located above it poised to destroy the Temple at a moments notice should Glinda or her sisters take up magic once more. As magic has been banned in Oz, Glinda now runs an orphanage. East even asks Dorothy, if she's one of 'Glinda's girls' sent out to kill her, meaning there's a second layer to the orphanage venture.
