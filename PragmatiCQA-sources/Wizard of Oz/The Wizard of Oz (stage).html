   It was described as one of the most successful American stage extravaganzas of the early twentieth century, as it had about it the magic and wonder of a child's world fantasy.

   After fourteen weeks in Chicago, the show toured the West and Canada, then moved to New York. It ran at the Majestic Theater on Broadway for 293 stage nights from January to October 1903. It returned to Broadway in 1904, where it played from March to May and again from November to December. It successfully toured the United States with much of the same cast, as was done in those days, until 1911, and then became available for amateur use.

   The three partners, Baum, Tietjens, and Denslow, quarreled over the division of the royalties even before the show premiered. The original arrangement called for an equal three-way split; Baum and Tietjens thought Denslow was overpaid for his limited contributions, while Denslow thought he deserved half. The dispute led to the end of Denslow's partnership with Baum.

Things are broken up by a furious cyclone. Dorothy and Imogene take shelter in the farmhouse, which through a piece of stage trickery highly acclaimed by the theatre critics of the era is whisked away into the sky. The action shifts to the Land of Oz, where the Munchkins dance around their maypole. Suddenly the cyclone strikes there and the lights go down. When the lights have returned again, Dorothy's house has fallen to earth intact and unharmed, and the house has accidentally killed the

    Dorothy exits the house and marvels at the strange land as Dashemoff has written a song for her, thinking her name is Caroline Barry. He is disappointed when Dorothy disproves the fact. The Good Witch awards Dorothy with a magic ring that can grant three wishes and summon the Good Witch at any time. Dorothy wishes she knew the word to Dashemoff's song and accidentally wastes the first wish by singing the song "Carrie Barry". Soon Pastoria enters, flanked by General Riskitt, his girlfriend Tryxie Tryfle and the one-man Army of Pastoria. He is scalping tickets for his coronation, in order to finance his revolution. He was lost in Kansas many years ago and began working as a mechanic. He sings "In Michigan", about his favorite US state. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that if she wants to get home, she must ask the

Dorothy and the Scarecrow, meanwhile, are on their way to the Emerald City as they come upon the Tin Woodman, who has rusted playing his piccolo. As it turns out, the Woodman's real name is Niccolo Chopper and he is in fact Cynthia's lost lover. He sings "When You Love! Love! Love!" and explains how he has no heart, so cannot love Cynthia. He joins the others in the hope of receiving one from the Wizard so that he may return to Cynthia. In the finale of Act One, Dorothy, the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, Pastoria, the Cowardly Lion, Dashemoff Daily, and others all meet in a life-sized poppy field. The opium in the poppies makes all of them fall asleep, except the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman, who cannot smell anything. A thick snow rains down and kills the poppies. The Scarecrow and Tin Woodman look on in awe as the Snow Queen and her Snow Children all appear in a sleigh pulled by reindeer. The Snow Children get out and lift the sleeping characters up and put them in the sleigh. Act One ends as they ride off into the snow toward the Emerald City

The travelers all enter the Emerald City and in the courtyard, the Phantom Patrol greets the travelers. The Patrol disappears and reappears, and soon leaves for good. Cynthia returns and asks Pastoria if he is her Niccolo. When he says no, she becomes furious. The Wizard's Wise Men, led by Bardo, enter and introduce the Wizard himself. He performs magic tricks to entertain the crowd and sings the song "Mr. Dooley". The distraught Cynthia asks the Wizard if he is her Niccolo, and is further outraged when he says no. She exits. Dorothy, the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman come forward and request their desires (home, brains, heart). The Wizard gives the Scarecrow a brain of the Mark Hana variety and the Tin Woodman a heart. He declares this the greatest of all his achievements and calls for a celebration.
