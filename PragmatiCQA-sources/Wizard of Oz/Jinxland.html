   Jinxland is similar to Oz in climate and culture. It has bits of forest, verdure clothed hills, fields of waving grain, fountains, rivers, and lakes. Pretty houses are scattered throughout the countryside with a few grand castles and palaces. A rosy glow like sunset lights the entire landscape.
  </p>
  <p key="f1f18e36-2bdf-4f4c-8bde-4b7fd2fb8094">
   The magnificent royal palace is guarded by soldiers dressed in splendid uniforms and armed with swords and lances. The castle has many large rooms, all beautifully furnished, and the passages are winding and handsomely decorated. In the center is an open court surrounded on every side by high turreted walls and containing beds of flowers, fountains, and walks of many colored marble matched together in quaint designs.

   The people enjoy music. In celebration of their independence from King
   Krewl
   the brass band introduced a new piece of music called the "
   Ork Trot
   ", which was dedicated to the new ruler, "Our Glorious
   Gloria
   , the Queen"

   Some years ago, King
   Kynd
   fell into the Great Gulf that separates Jinxland from the Land of Oz and has not been seen since. His former prime minister took his place as King
   Phearse
   , but he in turn was overthrown by his prime minister, who became King Krewl. Because Krewl was a wicked king and mistreated visitors to his kingdom,

   . Gloria, the daughter of King Kynd, was made queen. She took
   Pon
