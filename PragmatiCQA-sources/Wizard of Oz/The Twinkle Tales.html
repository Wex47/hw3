   (1907), are the only fantasy works that Baum published under one of his many pseudonyms. They appeared as the work of "Laura Bancroft." (Baum's other pseudonymous works were adult novels and juveniles for boys or girls.) Baum used pen names to avoid competing with himself in the marketplace by issuing too much material under his own name. He came to regard the Bancroft books as being among his best, however, and regretted the use of a pen name for them; he asked his publisher to reprint them under his own name. Reilly &amp; Britton did issue an edition of

   under Baum's name in 1917; but the Twinkle stories did not appear as Baum's until
   The International Wizard of Oz Club
   put out its edition in 1987.

   The Twinkle stories were a popular hit, selling nearly 40,000 copies in their first year in print. The most popular of the six was "Bandit Jim Crow," which determined the choice of the sequel,

   Though the individual tales are each story-length, 4000 words or so, all are divided into eight short chapters for the convenience of the young reader. Each booklet, printed in large type, was 60 to 70 pages in length, with fourteen or fifteen full-page color illustrations. The stories have a unifying theme of kindness rather than cruelty toward animals.
