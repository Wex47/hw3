   that was being mounted that year. The character of the Wogglebug was popular at the time, and became something of a national fad: there were Wogglebug postcards and buttons, a Wogglebug song, and a Wogglebug game from Parker Brothers. (The stage musical, however, was not a success, and closed after a few weeks.) In 1906, there was even a race car called the "Woggle-bug" from the Stanley Steamer company; it crashed in 1907.

   The Wogglebug, who favors flashy clothes with bright colors (he dresses in "gorgeous reds and yellows and blues and greens" and carries a pink handkerchief), falls in love with a gaudy "
   Wagnerian
   plaid" dress that he sees on a mannequin in a department store window. Being a wogglebug, he has trouble differentiating between the dress and its wearers, wax or human. The dress is on sale (for $7.93, "GREATLY REDUCED"). The Bug works for two days as a ditchdigger, to earn money to buy the dress. (He makes double pay, since he digs with four arms instead of the usual two.)
  </p>
  <p key="f0bf23aa-4ac2-48e7-9057-ca5603615dd1">
   He arrives too late, though: the dress has been sold, and passes from one owner to another in the second-hand clothing markets. The Bug pursues his love through the town, ineptly courting its wearers (Irish, Swedish, and African-American women, plus one Chinese man). His pursuit eventually leads him to an accidental balloon flight to Africa. There, menacing Arabs want to kill the Bug, but he convinces them that his death would bring them bad luck. In the jungle, he falls in with the talking animals that are the hallmark of Baum's imaginative world.
  </p>
  <p key="d5f2f1b6-2fa7-48be-af2c-5d1e7cb81f7e">
   In the end, the Bug makes his way back to the city, with a necktie made from the dress's loud fabric. He wisely reconciles himself to his fate:
