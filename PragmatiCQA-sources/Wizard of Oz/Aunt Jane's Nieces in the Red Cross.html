   series, and like all the books in that series was issued under Baum's "Edith Van Dyne" pen name.
  </p>
  <p key="0ad0a8ca-fe46-43a2-977c-c6521d95e555">
   In Baum's canon, the book is notable for its expression of his views and feelings on World War I.
   It is also the only book in the series, and a rare Baum book in general, that was substantially revised for a second edition. The 1915 original was published when the United States was still neutral in the War; the 1918 second edition was revised by Baum to reflect changed attitudes after America's entry into the conflict.

  <p key="1119a146-d199-4b46-9cea-98a72afef974">
   The story opens on 7 September 1914;
   Patsy Doyle
   ,
   Beth De Graf
   , and their
   Uncle John

   . Maud has come to New York on her way to Europe, where she will serve as a nurse. (She trained in nursing before becoming a film star.) Patsy and Beth are struck with admiration for her action, and are eager to follow her example. When Uncle John finds that he cannot dissuade them, he resolves to support their effort; he uses his wealth and influence to form a connection with the American Red Cross. Ajo Jones, also enthusiastic for the cause, volunteers his ocean-going yacht, the

   , painted with large red crosses, is in Dunkirk. Among their staff is a talented surgeon, Doctor Gys. He is "an eccentric, a character...erratic and whimsical," an adventurer who has been from the Arctic to Yucatan, and in the process has been badly disfigured by hard-luck accidents (involving icebergs and poisoned cacti). Gys calls himself a coward, but also sees death as a release from his disfigured body; he wonders what kind of death would be preferable, and has a morbid interest in confronting the violence of the War. The Americans also acquire a Belgian chauffeur named Maurie as an ambulance driver; he provides comic relief for the story.
  </p>
  <p key="c242343f-dfeb-4b13-b0f1-1218535b893b">
   The protagonists cope with military bureaucracies and confront the horrors of the battlefield (though Baum, "in keeping with his Van Dyne persona...kept his descriptions mild").
   Beth previously had a year of nursing training, but Patsy is a neophyte who is shocked by the conditions she encounters. Doctor Gys reacts with paralyzing fear to his first exposure to combat, though his medical discipline soon takes over and he functions effectively.
  </p>
  <p key="7210ee5e-160a-4535-8f13-f6e12fba76d5">
   In the climax of the story, Patsy is injured but recovers, but Dr. Gys is killed on the battlefield. Though Gys had repeatedly proclaimed his cowardice, his death is heroic.

   The Americans lose the confidence of the French authorities at Dunkirk when a German prisoner they are treating escapes their custody; fewer wounded come to their ship as a result, and it appears that their usefulness is limited. After three months of service, the girls return to the United States. Uncle John tells them that "You have unselfishly devoted your lives for three strenuous months to the injured soldiers of a foreign war, and I hope you're satisfied that you've done your full duty."

    The 1918 revision

  </h4>
  <p key="6574aade-c651-4188-a481-d395bf6c3acd">
   By 1918, the American entry into the War had changed the general situation. On the purely personal level, two of Baum's four sons were serving with the American army in Europe.
   For the 1918 revision, Baum wrote four new chapters that toughen the tone of the book and replace the original neutral outlook with one that favors the Allies.
  </p>
  <p key="10301133-55c4-4a34-bc37-dff8e85b538a">
   Where the War had been seen as waste and folly in the earlier version, the revision sees it as a moral conflict between right and wrong. John Merrick asserts that his "money and energy must be expended in defeating the menace of the Central Powers." The horrors of war are given a more direct treatment, particularly in the case of an American cameraman who is badly wounded and treated by the nurses.
  </p>
  <p key="ed74ec04-4639-4aeb-892c-ce0475ca363f">
   The ending of the story varies significantly between the two versions. In the 1918 text, the girls do not go home after three months, but plan to stay as long as they can be helpful. Dr. Gys survives, and his disfigurements are remedied by a skilled plastic surgeon. Once Gys is restored to his original good looks, he and Beth become engaged to be married. Also, a post-war marriage between Patsy and Ajo is implied.

It is the most serious of the ten novels, with the weightiest subject matter; and it takes its protagonists out of the world of girlhood and into adult life. Both the remaining single cousins, Patsy and Beth, are moving toward maturity and marriage at the end of the novel.
