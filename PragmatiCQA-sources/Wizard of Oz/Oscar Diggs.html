   The iconic character of the Wizard can appear to be a rather controversial one. At times the Wizard seems charming, genuine and caring, yet at others Oz's true intentions can seem rather questionable to the point of looking quite sociopathic. Overall, Oscar is a cornfed, dried-up, old man who remains a fun loving country boy at heart. His wrinkled face is cheerful and his eyes glimmer with innocence and adorable humor. He is described as being completely bald and always appears clean shaven in the face.

   in his hot air balloon, he lived in a Circus Carnival and traveled all around the countries in America duping people left and right and practicing the magic tricks that made him a great Magician. In his later years, he was known as a greatly gifted illusionist and also a skilled Ventriloquist, able to imitate any bird, beast or human (male or female). In Baum's later Oz books, he proves himself quite a creative inventor of sorts, providing devices that aid in the various characters’ fantastical journeys. He also introduces to the Ozians the use and value of money, and in Baum's eighth Oz book titled

   . Oscar is a very clever and intelligent man. Being a certified artistic master of illlusions, because of his long experience in the craft there is almost nothing he cannot do. When he arrived in Oz he used his incredible skill in magic to fool literally thousands of people and also the witches who lived and ruled in various parts of Oz, making them think he too was very powerful, almost omnipotent, thus protecting themselves from any threat. The Magician eventually also became a master of real magic, when he finally returned to Oz and went to live in the Emerald City permanently under the reign of

    In Baum's original 1900 novel, Oz not only appears as a gigantic green head levitating above a jeweled throne, but also as several other mystical beings as well. In the book, Oz only allows Dorothy and her friends to speak with him one at a time and each on separate days. Oz meets with Dorothy first and appears to the girl and her dog as a green head. To the Scarecrow, Oz appears as an elegant enchantress with wings and dressed in fine robes. To the Tin Woodman, Oz takes the shape of a frightening beast with horns. And to the the Cowardly Lion, Oz has no physical form at all, but is a fierce ball of flaming fire brightly burning in mid air. Despite his different appearances Oz tells Dorothy and her three friends all the same thing: if they want their wishes granted they must first kill the

   suggests that Baum may have derived elements of the character and backstory of the Wizard from Washington Harrison Donaldson, a balloonist, ventriloquist and stage magician who worked for P. T. Barnum. On July 15, 1875, Donaldson made an ascent near Chicago and disappeared in a storm; neither he nor his balloon was ever seen again. Baum’s Wizard meets a better fate than Donaldson presumably did.

   First shown working as a magician in the Baum Brothers Circus in 1905, Oscar is a selfish and greedy con artist who aspires to be great. He uses his charm, wit, and ingenuity to deceive others, typically acts only upon his best interest, and does not think of himself as a kind person. Despite this, he has a surprising amount of empathy, and has proven to have a good heart.
   Glinda
   describes him as being "...selfish, weak, slightly egotistical, and a fibber." His personal hero is Thomas Edison. He is portrayed by
   James Franco
