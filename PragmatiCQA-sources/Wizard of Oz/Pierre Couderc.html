   Born in Paris, Couderc began as an acrobat; he was cast in the title role of the first Oz Film production,

   reportedly could not find a female performer with the athleticism the part demanded. (He was billed as "the Marvelous Couderc.") He went on to play in the firm's subsequent films

   After the Oz company closed its doors in 1915, Couderc continued to act and do stunt work in films. In the 1920s he switched to screenwriting, and generated scenarios for more than thirty pictures. In a rather discontinuous career, Couderc also earned some credits as an associate producer in the 1950s.
