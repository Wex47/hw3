Their job is to keep intruders out of the enchanted forest that dwells behind them, which they guard and protect.

   , the trees are portrayed to be apple trees who hate people picking off the attractive and ripe apples that grow and dangle on their branches. Unlike the book; the Scarecrow and Dorothy manage to escape easily. Scarecrow also managed to trick them into pelting him with apples in order to get food. Dorthy finds Tinman directly after picking up the apples. Tinman doesn't interact with the trees at all, unlike the book. They have funny husky voices and always argue.
