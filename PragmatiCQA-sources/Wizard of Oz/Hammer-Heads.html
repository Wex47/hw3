   The Hammer-Heads are not very sociable and do not interact with anyone else in Oz, preferring to stick close with their own kind. They are extremely independent and are not very welcoming to visitors who come across them, as they are known for being quite unfriendly and sometimes even hostile and violent. They are unreasonable beings who do not and will not negotiate, compromise or agree with anyone. They are difficult and disagreeable to outsiders and foreign travelers. They will not allow any trespassers to cross or pass the rocky mountain hill they live on and dwell within because it is their strictly their rightful turf and territory. Therefore, the Hammer-Heads live a reclusive and isolated existence and do not like to be disturbed. Because of their nature, they are usually avoided by the majority of all people who live in Oz, obviously for the better.

   The Hammer-Heads are rather funny looking and short, stubby and stout with no arms at all, not even stubs. Their big oversized heads are flat on top, with a very smooth surface. Their necks are incredibly long like elastic, stretching out like an accordion. They can shoot these necks out like a spring of a Jack in the Box. This allows the Hammer-Heads to defend themselves as they will strike out at intruders with their heads to knock them down hard to keep them away from their turf.

  <p key="5283f41a-0358-4dd9-9562-c684ffb657ad">
   After hitting their targets, they then quickly pull their slinky like necks back to their shoulders and back into place until someone else steps foot on their mountain or comes too close to their turf.
