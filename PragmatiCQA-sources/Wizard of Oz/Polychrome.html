The group quickly grew fond of her, resulting in Polychrome befriending Dorothy and joining the group on their unexpected journey. While walking, Polychrome explains to her new friends that she was accidentally left behind by her sky-family when she failed to reach her bow in time when it departed from the earth.

   It is made clear that although she appears to have a human form, Polychrome has a different construction unlike those of flesh and blood. The fact it is stated that Polychrome is thousands of years old, yet remains a very young lady in appearance bears this out.
  </p>
  <p key="1d2aae75-3459-43ee-b7ff-1e67ba39c994">
   Polychrome is not necessarily an Ozian. She was not born in Oz, but in the skies above Oz and all the other magical countries in the parallel universe where Oz and its neighboring magical countries can be found. Polychrome and her sky-family reside in the places that have been enchanted by the magic of Fairy Queen
   Lurline
   and are cut off from the rest of the world where real magic no longer exist. Being a sky fairy, Polychrome has no blood in her form. Instead of blood she is said to made of "Rainbow Dust", which causes her unique form to appear translucent whenever she catches the sun. Polychrome is the very embodiment of all things luminous, ethereal and angelic. Baum says that in appearance she is unbelievably radiant, magical, beautiful, unearthly, dainty and pure and mesmerizing. Polychrome weighs nothing and is as light as a feather so when she walks she effortlessly floats in the air, staying at least half an inch above the earths soil, barley touching the ground if at all. To keep herself warm while on earth she dances and only the tips of her toes touch the floor as if she was a Ballerina.
  </p>
  <p key="ff9ddcc6-10bc-4ae5-9771-c314489c218e">
   Polychrome's skin glows a bright bronze and shimmers in the sunlight. She has bright, stunning, extremely long golden hair that glows as if it were on fire and remains completely loose as it gracefully swims all around her in a cloud as if she were under water. Her large eyes are filled of curiosity, innocence and wonder, and of a deep bright violet colour. Polychrome wears flowing, fluffy and gauzy robes of many layers consisting of soft material like thin woven cobwebs colored in uneven stripes of violet, rose-red, topaz, olive, azure, and pure white that all seem to gracefully melt very beautifully into the other creating a tie-dye effect. Her flowing clothes are sheer and also translucent like her form. Interestingly, her attire is not made of cloth or fabric, but clouds painted with "Rainbow Tears". Most of Polychrome has the form,resemblance and figure of the divine goddess of rainbows.

  <p key="d7aae012-d937-49cd-af39-af266fa6de83">
   Polychrome is naturally very gentle and delicate in her movements. She is quiet and timid when meeting humans and people from the earth. She usually remains distant until she feels comfortable around them by gaining their trust and knows they will not harm her or try to catch her. Polychromes favorite thing to do other than riding on bows all day with her "
   Rainbow
   Sisters" is dancing. Polychrome will freely twirl, spin, jump and leap all about for hours without getting tired or sleepy. Polychrome is said to weigh nothing, not even a pound and eats very little compared to regular mortals. Her diet consists of fresh rain dewdrops, mist-cakes, and cloud-buns. When she tries some of the food Dorothy received in Foxville, she only has a sip of tea and a small nibble of cold turkey. Dorothy says that it's about as much as a fly would eat. Polychrome does, however, manage to slap a guardian Scoodler, allowing Dorothy and her friends to escape being made into soup.
