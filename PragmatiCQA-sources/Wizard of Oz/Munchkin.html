    Munchkins
   </b>
   are a fictional race created by
   <a href="L. Frank Baum.html" key="2e6a0cef-7bf7-4967-8d9e-7ca3634105ba" title="L. Frank Baum">
    L. Frank Baum
   </a>
   , author and creator of the Oz legacy. They first appeared in Baum's first Oz book titled
   <i key="f7c1d5d0-3a0c-4d76-95a6-6f045617b593">
    The Wonderful Wizard of Oz
   </i>
   , published in 1900. They are the first Ozians to be introduced in Baum's story, making an introduction in the second chapter. Unlike the iconic movie musical adaptation of 1939,
   <i key="0761b039-3f4f-4f17-a7dc-c2d392304405">
    The Wizard of Oz
   </i>
   , in the original story Baum states that Munchkins strictly wear only shades of blue clothing as blue is their favorite color and the mascot color that represents their native homeland which is the eastern quadrant in Oz called
   <a href="Munchkin Country.html" key="7cd97071-0362-4186-bcc7-1d57cab99251" title="Munchkin Country">

   . Some Munchkins even have blue hair or beards in later books.

   We are told in the first book that the majority of these folks are usually rather short in height, being no bigger than three or four feet high. They are said to be the shortest tribe in all the land of Oz. They are mostly high spirited, and are content with their lives. The Munchkins are the wealthiest and healthiest race of Ozites in all of Oz. But while the first book does state that the Munchkins were scarcely taller than Dorothy, in later books they are mainly depicted to be as tall as anyone else in Oz; one tall Munchkin of note is
   The Soldier With The Green Whiskers
   (aka Omby Amby/Wantowin Battles). Nick Chopper, aka the Tin Woodman, was a Munchkin himself, or was at least born in Munchkin Country, as he confirms in
   Chapter 15
   of
   <i key="d5be7b50-b147-495c-8315-f4374b63e333">
    The Tin Woodman of Oz
   </i>
   when he states thatÂ he was born in the forests of Munchkin Country which the Yellow Brick Road passes through. He is depicted as the height of an average adult as well.

   Like the 1939 movie, some Munchkins do indeed speak in rather high pitched mousy voices and some speak in deep low voices. Despite their vocal differences the Munchkins in general are not at all harmful but infact gentle people who are not violent but are easily intimidated when challenged by anything bigger than them. Because of this the Munchkins usually keep to themselves, not bothering anyone else outside their own country or causing other Ozites trouble. They are naturally very humble, happy little people who work hard to make a profitable, honest and decent living in Oz and love the simpler things in life such as the great out back of the Munchkin Country. A good majority of the Munchkin people are all gifted farmers who have large families. The Munchkins all live side by side with their neighbors, and treat eachother like family, always being loyal to thy neighbor and are glad to help one another if ever in need. The Munchkins mainly raise richly abundant crops and successful vegetable gardens and are known as some of the most talented people in Oz when it comes to growing crops as farming runs in their Munchkin blood. Therefore the Munchkins are naturally born with "green thumbs". Most of them own their own land which they turn into large fields of stocks that strech out for many miles across the land.

    The Munchkins are known for their happiness, gentleness and hospitality, welcoming anyone who visits the land in the east, where they live in peace and harmony. When Dorothy Gale was on the

   Jerry Maren
   played one of the iconic Munchkins from the Lollypop guild that welcomed Dorothy to Munchkinland.

Sometimes it is also referred to as Munchkin county.

   film production
   the munchkins were played by children and teenagers. These munchkins were cursed by being turned into graffiti as a punishment for painting on Evamene's playground wall. But after Dorothy flattened her with rubble after crashing through the Oz sign, the curse was broken, they were freed from their wall prison, and were able to play again.

   A card game franchise known as
   Munchkin
   exists. The game is a humorous take on paper-and-pencil roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons; there, "Munchkin" is a pejorative term for players who play in an aggressively competitive manner.

  <p key="ce454c20-58b8-4ac9-b6dc-96e2dec526f0">
   The game does feature diminutive creatures, harkening back to the Ozian origins of the term. Many editions of the game have been published; some of which are crossovers with other properties. An Oz edition of the game was released in the late 2010s.

Seven of the surviving Munchkins actors from the film were present.[1] As a result of the popularity of the iconic 1939 musical film The Wizard of Oz, the word "munchkin" has entered the English language as a reference to small children, dwarfs, or anything cute of diminutive stature.
