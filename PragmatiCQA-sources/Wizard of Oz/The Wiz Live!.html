   The travelers all soon get tired and get off track of the road. The Scarecrow decides they all should each go in different directions to find the road. But before Dorothy could find the road, she hears a familiar voice. It was the voice and image of her deceased mother wanting the Silver Shoes. Dorothy believes this is her actual mother and obeys. Before she gives her mother the Shoes, the Tinman runs towards Dorothy, telling Dorothy it's not her mother, but a Kalidah after the Shoes. Soon an entire group of Kalidahs attack Dorothy, Scarecrow, and Tinman, who fight off the creatures while the Lion hides. Once they fight all the Kalidahs off, Dorothy thanks her friends, but before Dorothy thanks the Lion, the Tinman, now angered, starts taunting him for his cowardice. Dorothy begins to cheer the Lion up (

The Scarecrow and Tinman nearly fall into their trap seeing the beautiful ladies. Knowing how truly dangerous they are, The Lion tells everyone to hide and stay away while he handles the Poppy Girls. After he dances with the ladies, he ties them all up. The Lion and his friends proceed to walk to the Emerald City gate. The

When Dorothy tells the Wiz about her plans to leave her Aunt Em's farm for Omaha, the Wiz tells her that she can't go home until she decides which of those two places is her true home. The Tinman finally asks for a heart, and after the Wiz asks him why, the Tinman tells him (

She calls in her dinner, prompting the Winkies bring out the Scarecrow and Tinman, and tie up the Lion. The Witch threatens to make a fire with the Scarecrow, turn the Tinman into a cooking pot, and cut and boil the Lion into Forest Lion Stew. This gets Dorothy so angry that she throws a bucket of water on the Witch. Evillene screams in fear as she soon melts away. The Winkies, along with Dorothy and her friends, rejoice in the death of the Witch (

   Dorothy and her friends return to the Emerald City. The Bouncer won't let them in this time, saying the Wiz banned them from entering ever again. So the Scarecrow tricks the Bouncer, allowing him and the others to sneak inside the Wiz's room. While Dorothy speaks with the Wiz through his giant robot head, the Lion discovers the true person behind the Wiz. The Wiz turns out to be a fake, and not even a man, but a woman. She tells them her story, that she was once a magician's assistant from Omaha. By night they'd perform magic, but during the day they would give rides in a hot air balloon. She loved her job, but hated her boss. So in order to teach him a lesson, she left in the balloon without him one day, planning to land back down after he learned not to mistreat her. However, she got caught in a storm, and before she knew it, she was in Oz. When the Emerald City citizens saw her, they thought she was a wizard coming to save them from the Wicked Witches. Back in the present, the Wiz tells Dorothy's friends they had what they wanted all along. Then the Scarecrow asks the Wiz if she could take Dorothy home in her balloon. The Wiz refuses at first, but after Dorothy persuades her to abandon her life of deception and solitude, she offers to bring Dorothy back to Omaha. Dorothy quickly accepts.

    This is NBC's 2nd Oz project after the cancelled and then reordered
    Emerald City (TV series)
    . It is likely that this was either picked up as a replacement or to incite a renewed interest in

    Before the confirmation, it was revealed that NBC also had the choice of doing The Music Man as its annual live winter musical for 2015 (Previous: Peter Pan Live! in 2014 and The Sound of Music Live! in 2013).
   </li>
   <li key="0f30de3f-22f4-419e-894b-27b01ecc71d6">
    The show generated some controversy among certain white groups who accused NBC of being prejudiced by only casting African-Americans. Fans of The Wiz retorted by pointing out that it previously had an all-African-American cast both on Broadway and in its
    <a href="The Wiz (film).html" key="63928e57-c7ec-4af6-86fc-b5da0cd693fd" title="The Wiz (film)">

    </a>
    that had an all-white cast. After The Wiz Live! aired, Saturday Night Live addressed this controversy with a sketch in which the Wiz characters (portrayed by Sasheer Zamata, Michael Che, Jay Pharoah, Kenan Thompson, and Leslie Jones) experience a culture clash with the Scarecrow from The Wizard of Oz (Ryan Gosling).
