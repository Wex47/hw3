   , for stories on the theme of "Chicago's International Exposition, A.D. 2090." The concept was that the stories were reports on an imagined World's Fair held in Chicago two hundred years in the future. Baum's story was printed in the newspaper on Sunday, 2 February 1896; it won third prize.

   story, his predictions ranged from the technological to the spiritual. He anticipated something like motion pictures, via a device he called a "reflecting kinetoscope."
