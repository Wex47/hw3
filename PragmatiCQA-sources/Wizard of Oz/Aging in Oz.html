    Aging in Oz
   </b>
   is comparable to
   death in Oz
   , in that both natural processes have been largely negated by the spell placed on

   Yet, as with other such general and blanket statements in Baum's Oz books, this one masks inconsistencies and contradictions. The most blatant contradiction lies in the biography of Princess
   Ozma
   , which is crucial to the history and society of Oz. The

    Wizard of Oz

   delivered the infant Ozma to the
   evil witch
   Mombi
   , and Mombi enchanted the girl child into a boy. Ozma/Tip, however, did not remain an infant; she/he grew up through childhood, presumably at the normal human growth rate or something close to it. Ozma, of course, is a
   fairy
   , so perhaps the rules are different for her than for the humans who existed in Oz when Lurline cast her spell; yet it seems logical that Ozma, as a fairy, should be more resistant to time's passing, not less. I would also like to look at it as the characters grow if they please, but do not age and become "old people".

There, the anti-aging effect of Lurline's spell is not in effect; and Dorothy suddenly begins aging at an accelerating rate — she is turning into the young woman she would then have been if she had remained at home and never gone to Oz. In a panic, she quickly wishes herself back to Oz, where she reverts to her little-girl state (Chapter 10).

If procreation continues but people don't die, population growth could become a serious issue; though if the girls stop growing before they reach puberty, that would seem an effective method of birth control.

   It is unclear if outside influence can affect the aging process. The parents of those eternal infants of Oz might someday get tired of changing diapers, and wish that their babies might grow at least through toilet training. Can they do anything to stimulate their babies' growth? Modern Oz author
   Paul Dana
   carries one line of thinking to its logical extreme: women who are pregnant when Lurline casts her enchantment over Oz must stay pregnant forever, or leave Oz to give birth. (
