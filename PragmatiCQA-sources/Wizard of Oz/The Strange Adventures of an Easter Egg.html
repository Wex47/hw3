   Baum makes his Easter egg tale a round-robin story: a chicken lays an egg that contains a gold coin. The egg is dyed for Easter and passes from hand to hand until it reaches a poor girl. In the process, Baum gets in a dig at organized religion: a minster who possesses the egg passes it on because it is poorly dyed, and in expectation of gratitude. (The minister's wife also passes the egg along, but more in a spirit of Christian charity.)
