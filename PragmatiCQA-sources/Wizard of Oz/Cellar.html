In areas with wet climates, basements in homes are rare due to flooding concerns. But in places like

   lived in a small one-room house that did not have a garrett, or small attic, and did not have a cellar, with the exception of a small hole dug in the ground to serve as a storm cellar, or "cyclone cellar," for shelter from a tornado. The storm cellar, was accesssible via a trap door in the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole.

   Dr. Worley
   was a psychiatrist who performed electroshock therapy on his patients, which he claimed could control the brain's excess currents that cause strange dreams and delusions. His electric healing sanitarium had a cellar, which was used to lock up and hide those who had been damaged and driven insane by his machine used for the therapy. Since the cellar is not shown in the movie, only mentioned, it is unknown where in the clinic it was or what the size of it was.

Everyone was rescued except Dr. Worley, who ran in to salvage his machines. Since Nurse Wilson is seen carried off to jail in a police cart, it can be presumed that the insane patients locked in the cellar were also rescued and the truth behind Worley's criminal operation was discovered.

   , who is out in the fields, needs anything. But Uncle Henry is about to quit for the day so he can put his horse in the barn because there's supposed to be bad weather coming. Sur enough, they see dark clouds up ahead and head for the house. Uncle Henry tells Aunt Em that the sky looks bad, and it's the season for twisters. Aunt Em suggests they should make sure Dorothy knows what to do in the event of a twister, so Uncle Henry calls for Dorothy and shows her the storm cellar and explains what a twister, or tornado, is. But this time it turns out to be just a "plain old country storm", as Aunt Em described it, and it passes, leaving a rainbow which fades away.

   Two days, later, though, as Uncle Henry and Aunt Em go into town for a town council meeting, and Dorothy and Toto are playing outside, the sky suddenly turns dark to Dorothy's surprise, and that surprise turns to fright when she sees a twister in the distance, so she takes Toto to the house.

   She remembers to go into the cellar, and she opens the trap door and starts down, calling for Toto. When he doesn't come, she gets back up and looks for him, finding him hiding under the bed. She tries to coax him out, but no luck. She reaches for him, but he inches back. Dorothy is not able to get herself and Toto into the cellar in time. As the tornado picks up the house, it tips over, causing Toto to slide into Dorothy's arms. Dorothy tries to go for the cellar, but sees the inside of the tornado through the trap door, realizing that the house is flying.
  </p>
  <p key="7bfdda15-0df6-4b4c-823b-868b6fbc0632">
   She goes to the window for a better look, seeing all the debris that the tornado has picked up along with the house. She hears Toto barking frantically and sees that he has fallen into the trap door, but is holding on by his front paws. Toto falls, but Dorothy manages to grab his front leg and catch him just in time, and pulls him up. The shot of this happening is remarkably similar to the illustration in the novel, except Dorothy grabs Toto by the front leg instead of the ear. Dorothy does not close the trap door like in the novel, but holds on to Toto. The trap door is still open when the house lands, but nothing is seen under it.
