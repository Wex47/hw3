   : The opening scene takes place "many years ago in Oz" as Zelena places a green frosted cupcake in front of the magic mirror to watch her mother Cora leave her onto the road as a baby. With her plan to create a time travel spell to get revenge on her mother Cora and sister Regina, she first needed a symbol of wisdom, so she had a flying monkey grab the Scarecrow so she could take his brain. Just as she tried to cast the spell, a much older Dorothy burst into the throne room to stop her. It is explained that she was able to come back using the Silver Slippers after being contacted by the Munchkins who made her aware about Zelena's takeover of Oz though Zelena thought they could be used for "only a one-way trip".

   : Zelena once again shapeshifts as someone else and this time she pretends to be Mother Superior/Blue Fairy in order to get into the nursery where her and Robin Hood's baby is. The real Mother Superior comes into the room and Zelena reveals herself as she plans to take the baby. Unbeknownst to her, Hades in the Underworld orders Rumple to get him her baby for an unknown reason because he is willing to rip a contract which would allow him to get Rumple's yet to be born 2nd child. As she grabs "Baby Hood", Belle and Mother Superior holding her wand tell her to put the child back into the crib. Just as this is happening, Rumple casts a portal from the Underworld to Storybrooke which causes an earthquake there in the nursery. This causes confusion as Belle thinks Zelena made it happen, but she exclaims that she wasn't doing it. Belle takes the baby away and jumps into the portal while Zelena jumps after them as it takes them to outside of the alternate monastery. Zelena who is slightly injured tells Belle they are in the Underworld and that Hades must want her baby. Belle still holding the child runs off as Zelena pleads for the baby to be handed back to her.

   The ramifications of the time travel spell being cast at the end of season three that only went to the time of when Snow met Prince Charming sets into motion the events of season four. A major surprise occurred when it was revealed halfway in the season that Zelena shape shifted into the form of Robin Hood's wife named Marian by using the six-leaf clover. Originally the real Marian was killed by Regina but alternately was saved by Emma but ironically killed by Zelena. She stayed in the form making everyone believe she was Marian and incidentally was briefly frozen in ice close to death because of a curse made by a villain named Ingrid. To be saved from the spell which can't be broken, she goes to New York with Robin because there is no magic there. Believing she was his wife, it is revealed that he inpreganted her much to Robin's disgust in learning the truth. Zelena thus has a daughter of her own which has yet to be named and it is unknown if the child will have magic or not.

   The Scarecrow later appears when Dorothy returns to Oz as adult. In the series, he has a brain, but the Wicked Witch of the West wants to take it as an ingredient for her time travel spell. With the help of Hades, she succeeds in taking the brain, leaving the Scarecrow's fate unknown.
