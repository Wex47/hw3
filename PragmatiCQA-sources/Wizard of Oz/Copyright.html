   In general, the copyright law that prevailed through most of the twentieth century protected published works for 28 years, with an option for renewal for another 28 years. The law was amended in 1976 and 1998 so the period of copyright protection was extended. Currently as of 2021, this puts everything before 1926 in the public domain.

   This caused some confusion by reprinting Oz books many times without providing any date or edition information other than the original copyright date, a fact that has bedeviled book collectors who have mistaken later versions for first editions. The company reprinted Baum's pre-1919 books with the "Reilly &amp; Lee" imprint, instead of the "Reilly &amp; Britton" imprint of the original editions with no other indication that the books were later editions. Canadian editions of the Oz books were issued by the firm
