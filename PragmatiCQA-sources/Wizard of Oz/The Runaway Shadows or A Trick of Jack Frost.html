   and his cousin Lady
   Lindeva
   decide to go outside and play on the coldest day of the year. While the children are out,
   Jack Frost
   freezes their shadows solid, allowing them to run away. The shadows escape into the Forest of
   Burzee
   where they are attacked by
   Kahtah
   the tiger. A
   Ryl
   advises the shadows to return to their masters and they obey, just in time for the Prince to be crowned king.
