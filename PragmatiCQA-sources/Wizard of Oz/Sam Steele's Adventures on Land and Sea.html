   Sam Steele, sixteen years old, is the son of a sea captain. His father is reported killed in a shipwreck, and Sam is quickly cheated of his inheritance. Now an orphan, Sam meets his maternal uncle, Naboth Perkins, another sea captain and ship-owner; together, the two set sail in the

   Sales of the Sam Steele books were disappointing, however; publisher
   Reilly &amp; Britton
   took the unusual step of re-launching the series under new titles and a new pen name — the

   One segment of the plot touches upon the question of race and race bias in Baum's work. Two key supporting characters in the plot are men of color from the Sulu Archipelago, nicknamed Nux and Bryonia. The gruffer characters refer to them as "n----rs," but the kind hearted characters never do. The two become friends and companions of Sam Steele, and are presented as unflinchingly courageous, loyal, reliable, caring, strong, and resourceful. After one crisis in their adventures, Sam remarks, "I realized that, with a grateful heart, that I owed all my good fortune and narrow escapes to the faithful Sulu men..." (Chapter 14). Uncle Naboth expresses his satisfaction that the two men accompany Sam, for "Those two men are as faithful and honest as any men of earth..." (Chapter 15).
