   is a 1916 juvenile novel for girls that

    L. Frank Baum
   </a>
   wrote under his pen name Edith Van Dyne. The book was the first volume in a series that Baum continued up to his death, and which was carried forward posthumously by
   Emma Speed Sampson
   . The novels have sometimes been known as the "Bluebird Books" because of their characteristic blue covers.

   By 1915, Baum's publisher

   Baum responded by writing the first version of

    Mary Louise

   . He named the book and patterned the main character after his favored

   Mary Louise Baum Brewster. The author was surprised and unhappy when his publisher rejected the novel; they judged the heroine to be too independent. Baum rewrote the book, giving it a more conventionally feminine protagonist.

   While the publisher's choice may seem odd today, it is not without sense in the context of the time. The

   Mary Louise Burrows is a privileged child, the darling of her mother and her "Gran'pa Jim," otherwise known as Col. Hathaway. She is surprised when the two suddenly disappear, seemingly abandoning her to the care of former servants. The girl is shocked to discover that her beloved grandfather is a wanted man, facing no less a charge than treason.
  </p>
  <p key="24c06265-0cda-44c2-8180-fd6a3dfa4cb1">
   Mary Louise sets off on a quest to unravel this mystery. She tries to find her mother and grandfather without betraying them to the law officers that pursue them. In time she strikes up a friendship with a Secret Service agent named O'Gorman, who seems genuinely sympathetic to her family's plight. With the help of his daughter Josie, O'Gorman is eventually able to prove the Colonel's innocence of treason, and restore Mary Louise's family.

   The first book was enough of a success to justify continuing the series, which eventually extended to ten books. Baum wrote the first four, though his son
   Harry Neal Baum
   is thought to have helped with at least the third,

   Interestingly, Mary Louise proved too tame a character to drive the series forward on a longterm basis. The  less traditional Josie O'Gorman, girl agent, came to dominate more and more; the titles of the last three books illustrate her takeover of the series.
