   The Land of the Mangaboos is lit by six glowing balls suspended in the air far above the ground. The central and largest is white, and arranged around it are smaller balls of rose, violet, yellow, blue, and orange. They generate no heat, but the dazzling light is blinding when experienced up close. The landscape below is splendidly colored by the variegated lights.

   The land itself contains mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, and some towns and villages consisting of many glass buildings. These buildings are made of such clear glass that one can see through the walls and ceilings as easily as through a window. They are not constructed by the Mangaboos, but grow large and fine over the course of many years. There are no stairs in their houses, since they are not needed.

   In the Land of the Mangaboos, it is possible to walk through the air, although the people usually move along the ground in the ordinary way. The

   suggested that this might be possible because they were close to the center of the earth where the attraction of gravity is weaker.

   The Mangaboos have two methods of ridding themselves of unwanted visitors. Some they throw into the
   Garden of the Clinging Vines
   where they are crushed and devoured by carnivorous plants. Others are forced into a cave in the mountains known as the
   Black Pit

   The Mangaboo Prince decided to do away with his guests, so Dorothy and the Wizard picked the next Princess who was standing ripe on her bush. The Princess, thanks to her advisors, also decided to get rid of the unwelcome visitors, and eventually they were forced into the Black Pit.
