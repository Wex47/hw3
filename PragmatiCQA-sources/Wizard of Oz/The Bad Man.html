   The narrator is pleased to have a day to himself, and plans to spend his time reading the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson. But his wife leaves him in charge of their three children. His son Charlie almost chokes on a shell from his father's collection. Mabelle wants her father to play a game, while Kitty wants him to read them a fairy tale. Kitty gets back at her unresponsive parent by telling her brother and sister a story about a Bad Man who needs to be kept in a cage until he is sorry.
