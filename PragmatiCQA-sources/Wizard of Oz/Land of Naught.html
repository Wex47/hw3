   The Land of Naught is made entirely of wood. The ground is sawdust, and the pebbles are knots. Wooden houses are scattered around, with carved wooden flowers in the yards. The tree trunks are of coarse wood, and the leaves are shavings. The grass is formed of wood splinters, but between the patches of grass and sawdust hard wooden flooring can be seen.

  <p key="1368ea01-05ac-46ae-b414-a8216e9ebf33">
   There is a wooden city in Naught, with tower-like buildings which are square, six-sided, and eight-sided. The prison is a tall building with a platform high off the ground, with many rooms inside but no windows or door.

   Wooden birds flutter among the trees and wooden cows browse on wooden grass. Even the Gargoyles are made of wood. Despite the creatures who live there, the Land of Naught is completely silent.
