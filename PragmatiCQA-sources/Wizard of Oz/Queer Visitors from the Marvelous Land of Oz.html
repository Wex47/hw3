   The newspapers paid Baum for the strip; from those fees he paid 25% to McDougall for the art, and 10% to
   Reilly &amp; Britton

   The format is not a comic strip in the modern sense, but more of a short story with full-page illustrations.

   (The comic was foreshadowed with a striking promotional device: newspaper announcements, beginning on 18 August 1904, of a strange flying object approaching the Earth, passing constellations and planets, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, and others, on its way. This in time proves to be the Gump transporting its Ozian passengers.)
