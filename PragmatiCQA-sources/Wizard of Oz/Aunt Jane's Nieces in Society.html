   John Merrick
   has a provoking conversation with his sister-in-law, Louise's mother. Mrs. Merrick insists that Uncle John's nieces suffer a disadvantage in being left out of "Fashionable Society." Though Uncle John knows that his sister-in-law is a vain and foolish woman, her criticism hits him in his most vulnerable spot: he cannot stand to think that his beloved nieces are lacking any of the good things in life. John capitalizes on a business contact with Hedrik Von Taer, a fixture of the Four Hundred, the social elite of New York City. The stockbroker asks his daughter Diana Von Taer to sponsor the nieces' social debut; Diana, well aware of John Merrick's millions and his importance to her father's business, agrees, as long as the girls are not "impossible."
  </p>
  <p key="536c95af-a4dc-41b3-879a-258de318fd92">
   Diana calls on the cousins individually; she is struck with Louise's sweetness and classic femininity, Patsy's liveliness, and Beth's beauty (though Diana and Beth dislike each other cordially on first acquaintance). Diana finds the three candidates at least marginally acceptable; she sponsors their debut, and all goes well. The cousins are accepted into the whirl of society, and are soon managing the flower booth at the year's biggest charity ball.
  </p>
  <p key="88fb5b25-8ad9-4306-965e-39c4b9b60f6a">
   Complications arise with the appearance of
   Arthur Weldon
   , the on-again off-again suitor of Louise from previous books. Arthur has been keeping company with Diana Von Taer, but once he sees Louise his passion for her re-awakens — which arouses Diana's jealousy. Diana solicits her cousin Charles Connoldy Mershone, a ne'er-do-well and social black sheep, to court Louise as a way to distract the girl from Arthur.
  </p>
  <p key="1f7681b4-5171-4e97-b59c-5cc481b375ed">
   Diana does not anticipate that Mershone will actually fall in love with Louise — but he does. When Louise rejects him for the upright Arthur, Mershone goes to the extreme of abducting her and keeping her at Diana's country house. Louise's relations call in the police and hire private detectives, including Quintus Fogerty, "The best man in all New York." Mershone, however, is clever enough to avoid quick detection.
  </p>
  <p key="85d1e39b-b5fa-4bfe-aefb-8c4a55dca98d">
   Louise is initially shocked and disoriented by her abduction; but after five days she recovers enough to stage an escape. During an "old fashioned snowstorm" she climbs out a window and down a trellis. She is eventually overcome by the storm, but is rescued by a passing farm couple. Arthur Weldon discovers Louise at the farmer's house, where they are joyfully re-united.
  </p>
  <p key="3ebf11d2-1ec3-4032-a950-f21df136ef03">
   Louise's family decides not to prosecute the now-repentant Mershone, to avoid a newspaper scandal and to eschew the "doubtful satisfaction" of revenge. The story concludes with the very fashionable wedding of Arthur Weldon and Louise Merrick.

  <p key="afde07cb-e135-466d-87c8-f8dd6b8a352f">
   Characters in this novel express pronounced skepticism about the pretension of high society. Patsy argues that "all decent folks" are members of society — and when another character calls this "communism," Patsy replies, "Perhaps so." Patsy continues,

  <p key="ea013ab5-97f1-4527-9d49-63b22b376411">
   Patsy is not the only skeptic: Beth's initial attitude is so negative that Louise calls her a "rank socialist." In the end, though, even Beth has modified her attitude toward the social world:

  <p key="c0c5928f-efeb-4558-99a1-85dc477dc5c3">
   Baum introduces the character of the private detective Quintus Fogerty in this book — a character who re-appears in a later volume in the series,

   </i>
   . Fogerty serves the "purpose of extricating the girls when necessary"
   from plot difficulties. Baum's use of this "real world" character has been seen as a sign that the genial milieu of his gentler characters, the cousins and their family, cannot accommodate the darker elements of American society.
