   The story, Baum's contribution to the "locked room" mystery, may have been rooted in an incident in Baum's early life, when he was working as a clerk in a dry-goods store: he found the body of a fellow worker, an apparent suicide, locked in a storeroom.

   Some readers have considered "The Suicide of Kiaros" one of Baum's best short pieces, as well as a rare display of the writer's "dark side." For a lighter example of Baum's crime fiction, see "
