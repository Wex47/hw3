   The
   Shaggy Man
   kept it in his pocket wrapped in crumpled paper and tied with a cotton string. He at first claimed that he had gotten the Love Magnet from an Eskimo in the Sandwich Islands. This Eskimo got tired of being loved, and gave the magnet to the Shaggy Man. The Eskimo was eaten by a grizzly bear the next day.

   Later the Shaggy Man admitted that he had stolen the Love Magnet from a girl in
   Butterfield
   . She was so loved that the young men quarreled over her. After the Shaggy Man stole the Love Magnet, only one young man continued to love her and they were married.
