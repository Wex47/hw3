   Uncle Henry is portrayed as a very humble, poor and even depressed, struggling farmer. Living on an isolated prairie, the man is one who only knows the simple, peaceful ways of farm-life. He has no children of his own and presumably never will. In a sense, he views his niece, Dorothy, as his daughter, even though the book, nor its sequels, ever clarify if she is blood related, adopted or was simply sent to the farm to be a farmhand to help the adults, who eventually grew very fond of her.

   An average day for Uncle Henry is waking up at dawn to the sound of a rooster crowing. He works hard all day long until supper time at dusk. If not attending to the barn and sheds were his horses are kept, or milking the cows, Henry is busy growing crops on the prairies to bring prosperity to his small farm to make ends meet, putting food on the table for his family. Dorothy, being a mere child spends much of her time playing with her pet dog,

   Unlike the 1939 movie, in the original book, Baum says they live in a one room home, much like a shack. The home was once painted white, but the hot Kansas sun chipped most of the paint away, ultimately leaving it just as dull and gray as everything else around. Inside the house is only a wooden table with three or four chairs, a rusted cooking stove and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em share a big bed in one corner of the room, and Dorothy has a small bed in the other corner. In the middle is a trap door that substitutes for a
