   The Musicker is a little fat man with a round face and faded blue eyes. He wears a red, braided jacket, a blue waistcoat, and white trousers with gold stripes down the sides. His head is bald and he wears a little, round, red cap held in place by an elastic band under his chin. He wears white cotton gloves and leans on a stout, gold-headed cane.

   Butterfield
   to Oz. Button gave Capo the nickname "Musicker." Shaggy speculated that Capo had swallowed an accordion in his youth. Capo asked for an invitation to
   Ozma
   's birthday party, but the wise queen decided, sadly, that he should not attend, because his uncontrollable vocal tic might arouse violence against him.
