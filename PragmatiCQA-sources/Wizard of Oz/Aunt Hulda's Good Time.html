   Both versions of the story relate similar plots: a privileged young man meets and befriends an old farm woman and treats her to a special day. The earlier, "Aunt Hulda" version is quaint and sentimental: boy takes farm woman on his bicycle to see the circus. The revised, "Aunt 'Phroney" version has a harder edge: banker's son drives farm wife to the country fair in his horseless carriage (a kind of machine the woman had never seen before, let alone ridden in), where she realizes her husband's stinginess and dishonesty toward her, and self-indulgence toward himself. Then the young man buys the woman the warm winter coat she lacks. (The idea of giving someone a needed winter coat also occurs in Baum's "
   The Black Sheep
   .")
