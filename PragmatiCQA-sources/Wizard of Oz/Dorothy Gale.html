    As a princess in Oz, Dorothy surprisingly maintains her innocent personality. Although she is proud of her title and position, she doesn't let it ruin her spirit. She instead remains as optimistic and wholesome as the Kansas girl she is at heart. Dorothy rather humbly accepts control of the Emerald City, hesitant to make rules on her own. She doesn't let power go to her head during these times and that is one of the many reasons why the citizens of Emerald City and the Ozians in general all love her.

   Dorothy Gale is just like any other little country girl of her time, ordinary, average and a well grown child for her age. She is a full blooded American girl who has been brought up and raised in the heart of America. Her exact age is never given in the original book, and is not given in any of the sequel Oz books by Baum. Despite this mystery, Dorothy's official Birthday is said to be June 10th and it does hint how old Dorothy might be; Baum does clearly state that Dorothy is just a mere child, a "little girl" from Kansas, not a teenager nor young adult. So, her character is no older than twelve being that she obviously has not reached her teen years. In Baum's later Oz novel,

Her thick, long darkish brown curly hair is styled in her trademark braided pigtails that remain untied, being allowed to naturally fall freely without any bows or ribbons; giving her a "rough around the edges" and realistic farm girl look. Baum stated that Dorothy only had one proper dress, which was gingham pattern of faded blue and white checks. Denslow illustrated this dress to have long sleeves, and a yoke neckline with no waist. She is also illustrated as wearing a large pink bonnet on her head as described in the story to keep the sun out of her face. Later on, when Dorothy is in the Emerald City, she traded in her worn out gingham dress for a pretty silk one with little jingle bells that dangled at the hem. she also started wear more precious dresses, accessories and jewelries while living in oz. This alone made Dorothy more and more princess-like and fashionable.

   In the rest of the Oz books by Baum, the characters including Dorothy herself, are all drawn by john R. Neill and she is illustrated to be a thin, ten to twelve year old who has short curly blonde hair styled in a blunt bob. Neill's Dorothy also appeared to be a fashion forward young lady for her time, having good taste in clothing despite being described as a poor country farm girl. In the books, it is suggested that Dorothy matured and developed a good fashion sense since her first trip to Oz. As it would be nearly four years until Baum would allow the character of Dorothy to return to the magical realm of Oz again. And once Dorothy is finally brought back into the Oz series, it's as if she's had a great makeover. All of her physical appearance, looks, youth, great health, complexion, spirit and personality and her heart, soul, mind, might, brains, hygiene and demeanor and strength and form had all exceedingly, incredibly and extremely blossomed, improved, bloomed, refined, perfected, primed and matured and glorified and purified than it all ever had, and had grown absolutely and supremely way better than it ever was. She truly became infinitely, impossibly and way beyond pretty, lovely, fair, fancy, grand, fine, perfect, youthful, delicate, elegant, delightful, graceful, ethereal, exquisite, divine, excellent, wonderful, heavenly, healthy, magnificent, lavish and stunning and enticing and alluring and drop dead gorgeous beyond all reasons, imaginations and words. She also became immeasurably and immensely beautiful, radiant, bewitching, adorable, darling, charismatic, mesmerizing, angelic, clean, fresh, better-looking, extravagant, appealing, pleasant, splendorous, easy on the eyes, flawless, dazzling, ravishing, sublime, fetching, shapely, amazing, astonishing, outstanding, glamorous, spectacular, breathtaking, desirable and attractive and irresistible and enchanting all on both the outside and on the inside, without all doubts, exceptions and questions.

   Neill's Dorothy was illustrated wearing very pretty and lovely dresses and fancy hats or oversized bows in her hair. And usually seen in polished dress-shoes, sometimes even carrying a matching fan or parasol to cool off with, or shade herself while in the hot sun. John R. Neill paid homage to W. W. Denslow's illustration of Dorothy Gale and Toto, specifically in Baum's fifth Oz novel

   were a mere invention for the 1939 musical movie as they felt red would stand out better on screen rather than silver in the primitive color process used during that era. Since Technicolor was something that was considered very new in that time, being used in films such as

   The difference between the novel and film: In the MGM movie, after Dorothy clicks the heels of the Ruby Slippers, she wakes up in Kansas on her bed again while concluding that her trip to Oz was a mere dream or surreal delusion.

   In Baum's book, Dorothy wore Silver Shoes designed in an Arabian/Dutch style with pointed toes and maryjane styled buckles. When Dorothy clicks her heels to go home, she holds

  <p key="6fcb526d-835c-4dd2-a9ac-504f161d0062">
   The explanation for this is that since the Silver Shoes are enchanted items they are stripped of the magic that holds them to Dorothy's feet when leaving the enchanted universe of Oz, explaining how they happened to slip off and drop into the

   below during the flight back home. Since the desert turns any living thing that touches it to sand, once the shoes fell into the desert they ultimately were out of reach and became untouchable. Now, one might ask how it was that Dorothy herself didn't fall right into the desert too since the shoes magic would not work out of Oz. This is because she specifically commanded the pair to take her safely to

When the farmhouse they were in landed, he was automatically given the ability to say actual words.

Toto also chose not to talk so that he didn't lead on. Thus, gaining valuable clues and information in chaotic or stressful situations from those who did not think he could repeat to others what was said.

In all of Dorothy's adventures in Oz, she seemed to have a maturity beyond her years and managed to take care of herself and Toto the best she possibly could. Dorothy was also portrayed as a natural hero unintentionally. She is seen overcoming being imprisoned for weeks and enslaved by the

   , Dorothy's mother, Ida Blake, was Aunt Em's sister. She ended her engagement to a man who worked in the main bank in Topeka after she fell in love with Robert Gale, who was helping to settle a strike at Ida's father's shoe factory. Angered, her ex-fiancé did everything he could to ruin the Blake family financially. Later, Ida's brother Charlie returned from a sea voyage and told Dorothy's parents of finding pearls on a South Seas island, convincing them that they could all get rich. Dorothy was left with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, but after Bobby and Ida sailed away, they were never heard from again.

   "Dorothy Gale" is a certified household name, it is the name belonging to one of the most beloved and well known characters of all time. But also one of the least discussed names of fiction. This is most likely due to Baum giving Dorothy little to no backstory. However, Oz's Dorothy was not the first Dorothy of L. Frank Baum's work. In Baum's first children's book titled

    Mother Goose In Prose
   </i>
   , published in 1897 there is also another Dorothy who later would be unofficially identified as Dorothy Gale in Baum's Oz book. The name of Dorothy in general was also a very popular name at the time and many fictional characters were being given it. Such as Charles E. Carryl's Fairytale titled

   , published in 1891. Despite this fact, Baum later insisted that he did not base the character of Dorothy Gale on anyone in particular.

  <p key="0174a93f-3ed0-4e1f-9ef8-69f875fc8c7f">
   Many Historians believe that Baum's original influence on the creation of Oz's "Dorothy" appears to be the Alice of English author Lewis Carroll's
   <i key="e5ee2ada-bbb8-4fb9-a90c-85eac1deb76b">
    Wonderland &amp; Looking Glass

   books. It is highly possible that Baum took some of the personality traits of Alice and morphed them into his own for his character. He ultimately Americanized the character who would become known as Dorothy Gale.

  <p key="a3f37a19-9b94-456f-bacd-e58ba87918c2">
   Despite Baum stating Dorothy is not based upon anyone real, the name of Dorothy was most likely chosen in homage to Baum's own real-life niece, 'Dorothy Louise Gage', who died in infancy. Baum's wife was very attached to her and was deeply grieved by her death, so there is speculation that Baum inserted her name into his stories as a memorial. Elements of Dorothy Gale's character are possibly derived from 'Matilda Joslyn Gage', Dorothy's grandmother. Dorothy Gage is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Bloomington, Illinois.

   Baum's Dorothy was around ten to twelve years old. Maguire also keeps her a mere child like in the original book, while also adding some of the personality traits and mannerisms of Judy's iconic portrayal of her who was sixteen when she played the role. And much like in the original story by Baum, Maguire confirms that her experience in Oz was indeed a real place and not a dream like it appeared to be in the 1939 film version.

Dorothy is mentioned several times but is only involved in the chaos and drama towards the end of Maguire's tale. Dorothy is seen as a mere outsider who cannot read Oz's unique writing system, knows nothing about Oz's complex politics and overall system, laws or history.

   it is revealed that the two characters discussed the etymology of Dorothy's name. Boq finds it interesting that it is the reverse of her land's "King" Theodore — which means "Gift of the Gods" — and that it means "Goddess of Gifts". This fact causes many of the superstitious Ozians to look at her as a saint in the flesh. And much like a disciple sent to Oz to fulfill a prophecy by the "Unnamed God". The fact that she wears
   Nessarose
   's magic shoes make the Ozians even more superstitious of her. And the coincidence her last name is the same of the Wizard's Army aka the "Gale Force" makes her nearly untouchable. Her disposition was so incredible to the Ozians, they imagined at one point that she must be an assassin, disguised as a "Gullible Sweetheart".

  <p key="9e997ffc-fd1a-496a-8dbf-3526d1a8e198">
   This pushes Elphaba to her psychological breaking point. She finally snaps and goes insane and this is when Elphaba accidentally sets herself on fire due to not paying attention to her surroundings. The hot sparks from a nearby candle caught on her long robes and black cape, setting her ablaze. Dorothy, seeing her in trouble, tries to save the woman and put out the fire by grabbing a nearby bucket of water that was collecting rainwater from a leak. Dorothy, not knowing water is fatal to Elphaba, tosses the bucket at her without a second thought. To her horror, it tragically melts her away, killing her by accident instead of helping her as Dorothy thought it would.

The Princesses name is Nastoya who appeared to the group as a human girl but was originally an elephant at birth. Nastoya explains to them all that because of the Wizard and his prejudice veiws against Animals, she disguised herself and vailed her true form as a clever shield of protection. Yet Nastoya confesses she is finding it increasingly difficult to switch forms which leads her to believe she is dying.

   and back to Kansas thanks to the power of Nessa's beautiful slippers. Unfortunately, she loses them when they fell off her feet on the flight back somewhere in between the universe that separates Oz from the civilized world. And just like in the original book by Baum, they are never recovered. Nevertheless, Dorothy reappears on the horizon, shoeless but still in one piece on the prairie, and of course, holding Toto in her arms.

  <p key="e53d0d23-aae6-4737-a071-7c462f2c47ba">
   Due to her extended disappearance and unexplainable survival from the cyclone, the other local children at the schoolhouse Dorothy attends, completely shun her and label her a freak of nature for riding the winds of a twister and living to tell about it, nonetheless suddenly reappearing out of nowhere months later.

   Six years later, Dorothy and Toto are unexpectedly sent to Oz by fate once again. But now she is approximately sixteen years old. Even though it has been less than a decade since her first visit in her world, it has been around twenty to thirty years in Oz's time.

   Back in Kansas, Dorothy's relatives never believe her stories about Oz and criticize her for having her head in the clouds and sabotaging her future. To help her forget about Oz, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry decide to take a trip to San Fransisco on vacation. However, after sightseeing, Dorothy ends up being trapped with Toto in a motel elevator when an earthquake hits (believed to be the same California earthquake from 1906).

   When the building collapses the elevator falls into the bowels of the Earth and into another dimension. It falls from the sky, accidentally lands on a cow, and kills it. And Toto is somehow lost in the process when he falls out of the elevator doors which are cracked just enough for him to slip through.

   Dorothy is buried alive under all the rocks and pieces of the Earth that the earthquake brought down along with the elevator. Luckily, it is found by nearby locals who dig up and save her. She suffers from a temporary state of amnesia and a bump on her head which gives her a near concussion. She is taken in by strangers and nursed back to health. She spends many months recuperating from the traumatic event and slowly gains her memory back.

   The first musical adaption of Oz was a Avant-Garde version loosely based upon the book and produced by Baum and Denslow (with music by composer Paul Tietjens) in Chicago in 1902 and moved to New York in 1903. Dorothy was portrayed by Theater Actress Anna Laughlin. In this stage version of Oz, many elements were left out due to being impractical for the time. For example: Dorothy does not wear Silver Shoes or any type of magic footwear.

   It used many of the same characters, and was aimed more at adult audiences. It had a long, successful run on Broadway. Baum added numerous political references to the script, mentioning President Theodore Roosevelt, Senator Mark Hanna, and John D. Rockefeller by name. Many existing songs that had nothing to do with the story were interpolated. Baum followed with two additional Oz musicals, The

   was fifteen at the time she portrayed the twelve-year-old Kansas farm girl who gets swept away to Oz via cyclone. She turned sixteen on the set during the shooting of the movie as she began to develop into a curvy young woman. Despite being technically too old to play Dorothy as Baum intended his character in the book to be a little girl, even as a teenager Judy did portray a very good Dorothy of Kansas that captivated the world for decades to come. With her wide-eyed expression of an adolescent girl, Judy was perfect for the role. Thanks to her talented singing voice, she beat many other young actresses for the lead role such as Shirley Temple who was a loyal fan of Baum's Oz books, and was more close to the look and age of Baum's description of Dorothy. Judy was put on a strict diet and even given barbiturate drugs which would lead on to a life long battle of personal demons.

   During shooting, Judy was forced to wear a special type of corset under her costume. It flattened out her curves by painfully binding her breasts down flat against her chest to make her appear as a twelve-year-old girl who was more innocent, underdeveloped and younger than her real-life age.

It was only when she took interest in Motown's film did eventual distributor Universal Studios take interest also. In the film Dorothy is portrayed to be a shy 24-year-old kindergarten teacher who is lost in life. She is scared of the world and has no direction of her future. Her trip to Oz is a late-coming of age story as she faces her fears head-on.

It has gained a huge cult following of fans from all over the world even 30 years after its original making, proving that it is much more than a dark, avant-garde children's film.

   , Dorothy gets carried to the :and of Oz via cyclone. When she introduces herself, she is thought to be the destined one to fulfill a important part of a prophecy regarding Oz's Witches from the South, West, North, and East. Zelena, aka the Wicked Witch of the West, felt threatened from Dorothy's arrival and became jealous of the girl which caused her skin tone to turn green, "green with envy". Later--when Zelena frightened Dorothy with a ball of flaming fire in her hand she tossed a bucket of well water at the Witch to put it out, but also melted her. Thinking Zelena was dead, Glinda the Good Witch of the South, took Dorothy to the Emerald City to seek the Wizard who was Zelena in disguise after surviving Dorothy's water attack. Zelena had turned the Wizard into a Flying Monkey to punish him for his dishonest ways.
