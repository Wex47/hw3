   The Yellow Brick Road begins in the very heart of Oz's eastern qaudrant known as the
   <a href="Munchkin Country.html" key="92f43a40-edb1-451d-91fe-705727a8c518" title="Munchkin Country">

   , which stands in the very center of the land. The road is said to be made entirely of millions of heavy smooth bricks which are all painted completely of a bright glowing yellow, the yellow is so bright it cannot be missed. The road itself is a very wide one in width and a very, very long one in length, running hundreds of miles on and across the vast landscapes and locations of Oz until reaching it's ultimate destination.

   The road is not all entirely straight. Like seen in the various movie adaptations of Oz, it gracefully curves and swoops, looping around mountains and swiveling over rich grassy green hills and attractive flowery meadows throughout the land. Even though the majority of the road is all neatly polished and smooth, the road does have areas where many bricks are broken or have been uprooted from it's foundation, such as in the dark forests and jungles in Oz where not many people wish to pass due to wild beast who dwell within, such as lions, tigers, bears and the flesh eating creatures known as the

   . Those places have missing bricks or large potholes and dead ends by steep cliff edges cutting the road in half. There are also areas where the road meets deep raging rivers and waterfalls or runs straight into obstacles such as the field of deadly

   . Cardboard murals were delicately painted by artist to connect the real road to the illustrated one. This trick allowed the road to appear much longer than it actually was on the MGM stage to add on to it's look in the background sets since computer graphics such as "CGI" did not exist yet. The paintings gave the road a realistic look for the technicolor camera, which gave the illusion of a very long road across beautiful landscapes.

   The inspiration behind the Yellow Brick Road is disputed. According to local legend, the Yellow Brick Road was derived from a road paved with yellow bricks near Holland, Michigan, where Baum summered. Yellow Brick Roads can also be found in Aberdeen, South Dakota; Albany, New York; Rossville (Baltimore County), Maryland; Bronxville, New York (on Prescott and Valley roads); Chicago, Illinois; Liberal, Kansas; Sedan, Kansas; and Syracuse, New York, as well as a school in Abington, Pennsylvania, and abroad in Sofia, Bulgaria. Historian John Curran believes the original road was in Peekskill, New York; older maps show that it would have been the quickest route from the docks on the Hudson River to the Peekskill Military Academy, which Baum attended as a child.

   The Vision Oz Fund was established in November 2009 to raise funds that will be used to help increase the awareness, enhancement, and further development of Oz-related attractions and assets in Wamego, Kansas. The first fundraiser is underway and includes selling personalized engraved yellow bricks, which will become part of the permanent walkway (aka "The Yellow Brick Road") in downtown Wamego.
