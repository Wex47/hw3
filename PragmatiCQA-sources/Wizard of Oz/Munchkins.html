   We are told in the first book that the majority of these folks are usually rather short in height, being no bigger than three or four feet high. They are said to be the shortest tribe in all the land of Oz. They are mostly high spirited, and are content with their lives. The Munchkins are the wealthiest and healthiest race of Ozites in all of Oz. But while the first book does state that the Munchkins were scarcely taller than Dorothy, in later books they are mainly depicted to be as tall as anyone else in Oz; one tall Munchkin of note is
   The Soldier With The Green Whiskers
   (aka Omby Amby/Wantowin Battles). Nick Chopper, aka the Tin Woodman, was a Munchkin himself, or was at least born in Munchkin Country, as he confirms in
   Chapter 15

   Like the 1939 movie, some Munchkins do indeed speak in rather high pitched mousy voices and some speak in deep low voices. Despite their vocal differences the Munchkins in general are not at all harmful but infact gentle people who are not violent but are easily intimidated when challenged by anything bigger than them. Because of this the Munchkins usually keep to themselves, not bothering anyone else outside their own country or causing other Ozites trouble. They are naturally very humble, happy little people who work hard to make a profitable, honest and decent living in Oz and love the simpler things in life such as the great out back of the Munchkin Country. A good majority of the Munchkin people are all gifted farmers who have large families. The Munchkins all live side by side with their neighbors, and treat eachother like family, always being loyal to thy neighbor and are glad to help one another if ever in need. The Munchkins mainly raise richly abundant crops and successful vegetable gardens and are known as some of the most talented people in Oz when it comes to growing crops as farming runs in their Munchkin blood. Therefore the Munchkins are naturally born with "green thumbs". Most of them own their own land which they turn into large fields of stocks that strech out for many miles across the land.

   Jerry Maren
   played one of the iconic Munchkins from the Lollypop guild that welcomed Dorothy to Munchkinland. The 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, also depicted Munchkins as being much shorter than other residents of Oz; they are played by adult proportional dwarfs, dressed in brightly multicolored outfits, and their land is called Munchkinland. Sometimes it is also referred to as Munchkin county.

   A card game franchise known as
   Munchkin
   exists. The game is a humorous take on paper-and-pencil roleplaying games such as Dungeons and Dragons; there, "Munchkin" is a pejorative term for players who play in an aggressively competitive manner.

   The game does feature diminutive creatures, harkening back to the Ozian origins of the term. Many editions of the game have been published; some of which are crossovers with other properties. An Oz edition of the game was released in the late 2010s.

Seven of the surviving Munchkins actors from the film were present.[1] As a result of the popularity of the iconic 1939 musical film The Wizard of Oz, the word "munchkin" has entered the English language as a reference to small children, dwarfs, or anything cute of diminutive stature.
