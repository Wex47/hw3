   When
   Handy Mandy
   lands in Keretaria, she first sees the great castle made of blue marble, and learns that it is ruled by King Kerr, with the aid of the Royal Persuader, the High Qui-Questioner, and Lord High Upper Dupper of the Realm. Kerr's nephew, the young Kerry, is the rightful ruler, but went missing two years prior, having been ambushed and kidnapped during a hunting trip.

  <p key="4d5d4a97-0ddc-48aa-bedd-696580f592c6">
   For a thousand years a prophecy has been etched into the west wall of the castle, reading "So long as the Royal Ox of Keretaria is in good health and spirits, so long and no longer shall the present King rule over the Land." Every time harm has befallen the royal Ox, the king has been destroyed soon after. This prophecy was created by a witch named Wunchie, who used it as a threat to keep the kings of Keretaria loyal to her. For this reason, Nox the Royal Ox is well taken care of even after Kerr usurped the throne. When Kerry was ambushed, Nox, then known as Boz, was knocked unconsious with the Silver Hammer and left for dead, and when he returned to Keretaria, his horn was bent and everyone assumed he was a new ox associated with the new king.

   Mandy soon learns from Himself the Elf, who resides in the Silver Hammer, that King Kerry is being held prisoner by the Wizard Wutz in the Silver Mountain, and sets out with Nox to rescue him. After the young king is rescued and Wutz is defeated, Kerr is revealed to have been one of Wutz's secret agents and deliberately arranged Kerry's kidnapping, and
