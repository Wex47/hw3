   many no doubt imagine families gathered around the television to share in the full-color glory of this timeless classic; but did you know that the book that the beloved movie is adapted from has been in the sights of censors since it was published? The common accusations are that it is “unwholesome” and “ungodly.”

   's tale was originally published in 1900 and adapted into a stage play in 1902 before arriving on the silver screen in 1939. It remains one of the most well known American literary works over a century later.
  </p>
  <p key="0db54b33-cca9-42da-92fc-fa061d139004">
   The New York Times praised the novel in a September 1900 review, writing that it “would appeal to child readers and to younger children who could not read yet.” The review also applauded the illustrations for being a “pleasant complement to the text.”
  </p>
  <p key="b9f7ff98-6291-4e50-ba2d-3ecb163308a1">
   Nevertheless, it has come under attack several times. Ministers and educators challenged it for its “ungodly” influence and for depicting women in strong leadership roles. They opposed not only children reading it, but adults as well, lest it undermine longstanding gender roles.

   In 1928, the city of Chicago banned it from all public libraries. In the 1950’s, Florida state librarian, Dorothy Dodd said the books were ‘unwholesome for children” and pushed to have them removed from all of the state’s libraries. Children's illustrator, Michael MCcurdy even criticized W. W. Denslow's drawings, stating that the illustrations of the Oz characters are tacky, gaudy and mundane; even going as far as saying Denslow's appearance of Dorothy made her come off as plain, dumpy, even ugly!

   for having “no value for children of today,” for supporting “negativism”, and for “bringing children’s minds to a cowardly level.” Professor Russel B. Nye of Michigan State University publically responded that “if the message of the Oz books- that love, kindness, and unselfishness make the world a better place- has no value today, then maybe the time is ripe for reassess a good many other things besides the Detroit Library’s approved list of children’s books.”

   In one of the most noted cases of censorship efforts against the book, seven Fundamentalist Christian families in Tennessee opposed the novel’s inclusion in the public school syllabus and filed a lawsuit in 1986 based on the novel’s depiction of benevolent witches and promoting the belief that essential human attributes were “individually developed rather than God given.”

  <p key="b4f91b9f-747d-48aa-84c9-0c6ebbc6ee6a">
   On the charge of including good witches in the story, they argued that all witches are bad, therefore it is “theologically impossible” for good witches to exist.

   One parent said, “I do not want my children seduced into godless supernaturalism,” accusing the book of teaching children to be self-reliant rather than dependent on God to see them through difficult times. Other reasons for the opposition included the novel teaching that females are equal to males and that animals are personified and can speak.

   The presiding judge ruled that rather than remove the book, the children were allowed to be excused from lesson plans centered on the novel. When they appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court, the court refused to hear the case. The group’s lawyers advised all “God-fearing Christians to remove their children from public schools.”

   In 2004 both Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson conspired to get the movie banned from broadcast on public television because of “moral turpitude.” Robertson would publically state that “The Almighty told me that flying monkeys and witches are an affront to all good Christians.”

  <p key="8308beba-7617-4b91-9ecf-49683477e3b0">
   When asked at the time if either had ever seen the movie or read the book, they denied, saying that they “feared ungodly influence.”

   The book has even been used on the political spectrum, with some claiming that it promotes socialist and Marxist values due to its perceived lack of a divine presence.

  <p key="2890191a-c4bc-4770-9fa4-cf29259857aa">
   Some librarians have also interpreted the book as a parody of American imperialism and racism. They rejected the author’s introductory explanation as an American fairy tale to encourage children to cherish life’s joyous wonderment, going so far as to describe the book as a “foolishly sentimental, poorly written, sensational, untrue-to-life, and unwholesome book.”

   In this modern age of YouTube and DVRs nothing ever gets lost, much to the chagrin of many politicians; but in the 1970’s something could be seen by millions and then disappear, never to be seen again, to be spoken about only as an urban legend. Such was the case of a fabled 1976 episode of Sesame Street, which featured Margaret Hamilton famously reprising her role as the infamous

  <p key="734b83f2-7d61-463c-bac2-171c7209909d">
   It wasn’t matter of a lost reel. The reason was far more bewildering-the Wicked Witch was deemed “too scary for the children watching the show.”
  </p>
  <p key="f8a8c594-bc5b-4589-b6b9-917040d90dcb">
   In the episode, the Wicked Witch is flying over Sesame Street when she drops her broom. David, a law student working at Hooper’s Store, finds it. She demands it back, threatening to turn Big Bird into a feather duster. Meanwhile, Oscar the Grouch becomes lovesick for her.
  </p>
  <p key="e19848b9-36a3-4f69-ac8e-680573dad5cf">
   She spends the episode trying to get the broom back, even going so far as to disguise herself as a kindly old woman. There’s even an inside joke when Mr. Hooper offers her a cup of coffee and she tells him she can’t stand the stuff. Hamilton was appearing in Maxwell House commercials at the time the episode aired.
  </p>
  <p key="b240ce2d-d563-49ed-8071-23c6827d49c4">
   According to information on Muppet Wiki, the episode prompted a high volume of negative mail from parents. Typical responses included concerns that their children were afraid and now refused to watch the show, using such phrases as “screams and tears” and “the threat of the witch’s power remains in children’s eyes.”
  </p>
  <p key="ca808557-e69b-4073-93e6-7c2a1c74a6ed">
   A somewhat unusual response even came from a Wiccan viewer concerned with the perpetuation of a negative fairy tale stereotype and recommended a segment portraying witches as they really are in the modern world.
  </p>
  <p key="c9bb942e-bca1-434e-bcd8-180d374bc10d">
   Due to the overwhelming reaction, additional test screenings were held from March 1 through the 5th, “to assess children’s reactions.”
  </p>
  <p key="996eadfa-092f-49c3-b828-f2b3f16913d1">
   The viewings indicated that that children were “exceptionally attentive during the Margaret Hamilton segments,” and those who watched the episode in color were fascinated by her green face. The issue of fear was difficult to fully judge, however, due to confusing answers and the fact that the children were surrounded by their peers and adults, and not watching alone. Despite all of the available information, Anna Herera of the Children’s Television Workshop Research Department suggested that “the Margaret Hamilton show not be rerun.”
  </p>
  <p key="5e488ad8-c696-4cac-a322-4d0b90171d9c">
   What’s surprising is that Hamilton appeared as herself, albeit dressed up as a witch, a year earlier for

   At Glinda's palace, they are greeted warmly by her all female army. It is revealed by Glinda that Dorothy had the power to go home all along, for the charm of the silver shoes can take her anywhere she wishes to go. All she has to do is knock the heels together exactly three times and make a wish. She tearfully embraces her three companions, all of whom will be returned, through Glinda's use of the Golden Cap, to their respective kingdoms: the Scarecrow will go to the Emerald City to rule the city citizens, the Tin Woodman to the Winkie Country to rule the Winkies, and the Cowardly Lion to the forest to be the King of Beasts. Then Glinda will give the cap to the leader of the Winged Monkeys, so they will be freed and never be under its spell again. Having bid her friends goodbye one final time, Dorothy does as she was instructed and wishes to return home. She is instantly teleported away in three steps, each step is made within the wink of an eye. When she opens her eyes, she and Toto are finally back in Kansas to a joyful family reunion. The silver shoes, however, fell off her feet on the flight back and are lost in the desert forever.

The colors in his plates match the journey of Dorothy and her friends through Oz — pictures of scenes set in the Emerald City are tinted green, and those in the Munchkin Country are dominated by shades of blue.

   Baum and Denslow split evenly a 12% royalty of the book; each earned 9 cents per copy on the $1.50 cover price. On 15 January 1900 each man received a $500 advance on royalties from the publisher. The book was an instant success upon publication, selling more than 37,000 copies in fifteen months. Each of the collaborators received royalty payments of $1,423 on 1 November 1900, and another $1,966 at the end of the following year.
