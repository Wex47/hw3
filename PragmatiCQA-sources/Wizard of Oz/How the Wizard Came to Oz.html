   Chapter XII. The Great and Terrible Oz. The Witches are shocked and dismayed to see the Wizard standing confidently and ready for battle, rather than quaking in fear. However, he is petrified.

Finally, the Witches let slip their giant spider. The Wizard's third pearl creates a 40-foot-tall man armed with a club. The giant man strikes the spider with his club, causing it to fly through the air and land in a forest in
