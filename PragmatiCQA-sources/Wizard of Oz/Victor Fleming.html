    Victor Fleming

   (23 February 1889 – 6 January 1949) was a major Hollywood director of the Golden Age. He directed most of the 1939 MGM film

   Fleming, a former race car driver, began his movie career in 1910 as a stunt driver. He became a cameraman and cinematographer in 1915, and worked on many films with Douglas Fairbanks. He made the leap to director in 1919, and directed a number of notable films through the 1920s and '30s. He had a reputation as an action director, and was a somewhat surprising yet ultimately effective choice for the

   Fleming had gained a reputation for being able to straighten out troubled productions, and was brought onto MGM's Oz project for precisely this reason. He started work on the picture at the beginning of November 1938. He also brought with him
   John Lee Mahin
   , his regular screenwriter, who worked with Fleming on the set to provide a final polish to the scripts Fleming shot. Mahin played the same role on

   A range of changes accompanied the new direction. (In one example, oval bricks in the

   were replaced with more standard rectangular ones.) Fleming directed most of the movie, though he did not remain to finish the job; early in 1939 he left to take over
