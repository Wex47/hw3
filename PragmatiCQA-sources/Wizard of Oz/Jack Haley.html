   Yet Haley, in turn, suffered an eye infection from the makeup, and missed several days of shooting to lie in a dark room recovering. His 40-pound costume prevented him from sitting down when he wore it; he had a leaning board that provided some minimal relief from fatigue.

   In the Kansas sequence that opens the film, Haley's character Hickory is mentioned as "tinkering" with a "contraption." Then Hickory says that people will "erect a statue to me in this town." In an early draft of the script, Hickory was shown trying to invent an anti-cyclone machine. This business was later cut, though traces of the idea survive in the surrounding material.
