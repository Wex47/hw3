When Trot and the Cap'n are trapped on the

And if meat grows on trees, carnivores like kalidahs could feed without predation. Yet neither Baum nor Thompson applied this concept as thoroughly and consistently as they might have done. It pops up occasionally: "Maybe there's a roast beef bush around here somewhere," says the
