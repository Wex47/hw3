   In the forty Oz books, it is revealed Ozma's mother was an ethereal enchantress and beautiful Fairy Queen named
   Lurline
   , who was of a mysterious higher power. Luline is also responsible for creating the realm of Oz by separating it from the rest of our world with her fairy magic many, many centuries ago.

   Ozma is a human descendent from Royal-blood as Lurline chose her mortal mate who is hinted to be Pastoria. When Pastoria became King of the land and to take Oz's Imperial Throne Lurline departed from him and left the land of Oz forever with her band of "fairy-children" to carry on with her duties and find more unclaimed lands to enchant. Even though Lurline is much like Ozma's birth mother, Ozma refers to Lurline as her "Fairy Godmother." However,

   Ozma's and Lurline's ancestors come from a very long line of a fairy-race, though Baum never elaborates too much upon them. This makes Ozma half mortal and half fairy, even though she does not bare magic wings attached to her body to fly, she naturally can perform simple magic as it runs in her blood. Ozma is one of the very few individuals and Ozians in Oz authorised to legally practice the magical arts whenever she wishes to do so. Especially when an emergency, good or bad has taken place.

   , she stopped the aging process in Oz forever. In addition, this spell also eliminated any unpleasant diseases or fatal deaths in general and none of the beings of Oz ever become deathly ill or die unless they are cruel and evil, such as the Wicked Witches who once dwelled in various quadrants of Oz. This spell is also so powerful, no Ozian is forced to age a single day in appearance if they do not wish to. In a few of Baum's last Oz books, it is said that Ozma eventually cut Oz entirely off from all the other outer worlds, making the land invisible to outsiders and sealing any portals or dimension openings. This was done to keep Oz from being discovered or possibly invaded by unwanted intruders. But before securing Oz's realm, Ozma invited some mortals from our world to relocate and live there permanently.

   As a half-fairy, Ozma is immortal, and would never age even if she were to live outside of Oz. Baum described Ozma as having the appearance of a young human girl no older than sixteen, and to be as fresh and clear as the purest dew drop on a Spring May morning. The greatest and utmost vision of loveliness, glamour, grace and elegance and pure beauty in the land of oz. She had large, lovely bright green eyes that sparkle like emeralds and speak truth and health under her long eyelashes. Her lips are soft and tinted like the finest pink tourmaline, and her long, thick curly and richest hair is a dark ruddy blonde with hints of gold, amber and ember that shines so beautifully and so stunningly when it catches the sunlight. and her whole entire features and figure was fabulously divine and wonderfully majestic. Most of all Queen Ozma's magical beauty and charms were so gloriously flawless and enchanting she is without a doubt the most beautiful, most stunning and most fabulous thing of all Ozians, Fairies and of all oz, fairylands and planet earth itself.

   Ozma never wears anything that would be described as casual. In the Oz books, she is illustrated wearing elegant frocks and extravagant robes of fine rich fabrics of many layers, which gracefully flow around her. Her authentic and luminous clothing is of weightless sheer gauze or silk. These dresses are always of pure white or shades of green in colour. The majority of all her wardrobe is decorated with soft feathers, pearls, glass beads and expensive jewels that are all sewn into the hems of the dresses to weigh the lightness of Ozma's attire down. Ozma's feet are dressed in silk pantyhose and she wears satin slippers with bejeweled buckles.
To complete her unique look, Ozma always wears either a solid gold crown that rises a foot above her head or a head accessory of two solid gold bands encrusted with emeralds that reads "

Her movements are dignified, smooth, elegant and graceful, her manners imply proper etiquette. She is also portrayed as an extremely compassionate, excelled, resourceful and benevolent and perfect little ruler, who never loses her temper or resorts to acts of violence. She does not believe in destroying even her worst enemies no matter how wicked or atrocious they may be.

   Lurline
   , the Fairy Queen who processed great magical powers only for good and is credited for making Oz a fairy country by enchanting it and cutting it off from the rest of the world centuries ago. When she first chose the land where she wanted to make Oz. Lurline used her magic to create it's breathtaking landscapes, making sparkling rivers and rocky mountains with high waterfalls, pine filled forests and thick jungles, rainforests, vast hills and colorful flowery meadows. And after it was finished, Lurline cut the land off from the rest of the world and named it Oz. She and Pastoria, along with the people of the fairy Kingdom lived amongst all of these lovely sights for a long time in harmony and bliss.

  <p key="baf5f713-aca6-4d3a-8f85-4d94f514e3c7">
   Lurline and Pastoria eventually came together as one and had a beautiful baby girl whom Lurline named 'Ozma', the first fairy child of Oz. The daughter of the two was half human and half fairy, making her immortal like Lurline even though Pastoria was not. After that Lurline left the land of Oz to continue enchanting other lands and created other realms similar to Oz. She put Pastoria on the Throne and left Ozma in his care before parting ways and disappearing forever with her band of fairy-children to began new duties. Lurline can be viewed as a mother-nature like figure as she has many invisible fairy children, who are the guardian angels to the lands Lurline has enchanted. They watch over all the living things, such as the trees, rivers, and soil. They keep the lands, such as Oz beautiful and fresh, bringing in the light cool breezes of spring and shade to hot sunny places, and carry the rich pollen which can be found within the spring flowers and little buttercups.

   The King Pastoria lived a long and wise life and he became very, very old with wrinkled skin and a long white beard. Now, widowed and left on his own with a baby infant and without the guidance of Lurline, Pastoria was not a very powerful King and was only getting older. He lived in a rather small Kingdom, in the middle of the land. His people were happy and content as his subjects, but the land of Oz was still inhabited by two Wicked Witches of the East and West quadrants and who also had many people from Oz enslaved. The

   The Witches were very powerful indeed, and could do as ever they pleased to anyone or thing that was unlucky to cross the Witches paths. These Witches cast many spells upon innocent people, turning them into random house or kitchen objects such as flower pots or candle sticks. The Wicked Witches tried many, many times to overthrow Pastoria and take over all of Oz as a whole. Unfortunately Pastoria himself did not know anything about practicing the magic arts, for he depended on Queen Lurline's magic. So he could not defend himself or his people. The Witches in Oz could have easily taken over and stole the King's Throne and enslaved his subjects to their own pleasing. The only thing that stopped them from truly doing so, was the other two Good Witches Locasta Tattypoo aka the

   The two Good Witches used all the power and sorcery they knew to protect poor Pastoria and his people from harms way. But they were not strong enough to banish the Wicked Witches out of Oz or put an end to them and the Wickedness that dwelled within the land of Oz all together.

   finally came, out of the clear blue sky. He was aloft in a large air-craft of sorts which came slowly descending down from the clouds up above. When it finally came to the ground, Pastoria's subjects and even the Witches of Oz themselves were astonished by his unexpected arrival. The Ozians had never seen such a peculiar invention. Inside the basket that was attached to the giant ballon was a man, he called himself "Oscar Diggs", and enthusiastically introduced himself as a great Wizard and gifted Magician. And the people of oz believed him as they saw him preform magic tricks right before they're very eyes. The people of Oz asked if the Wizard would be the ruler of the land and he agreed that he would look after Oz and someday rid the land of it's Wicked Witches if they promised to obey his every wish and demand. The people of Oz were gullible people and believed him and his promises. Thus, building the famous

   Shortly after the Wizard overthrew King Pastoria, he simply disappeared from Oz for a long, long time. The only thing he left behind was his baby daughter, the fairy child, Princess Ozma who one day would get old enough to use the magic she had, that ran in her blood, to claim her place as the rightful Heir to her father's Throne. This worried the greedy Wizard as he wanted the Throne all to himself. So one late night, the Wizard snuck into the Palace of Pastoria, and snatched the baby Princess up and disappeared into the dark night. He gave the baby Ozma to a Witch near by named

Mombi agreed to the Wizard's offer and favor to keep the baby hidden away from the Palace and to never let anyone know where Ozma was.

When the Scarecrow suggested a non-violent way to turn back the invaders, Ozma agreed and was able to protect her kingdom.

At some point Glinda turned evil and had to be magically sent away. When Dorothy returns to Oz via Glinda's red slippers, the Scarecrow tells Dorothy not to trust Ozma. Ozma tries to befriend Dorothy, but eventually the magic of the shoes corrupts Dorothy's mind, making her greedy, entitled and power-hungry. When Ozma sees that the shoes are turning Dorothy evil, she tries to make Dorothy remove them, but out of anger Dorothy does a magical attack on Ozma's brain, leaving her with brain damage, as she is in the first book when Amy Gumm meets her after a tornado brings her from Kansas.Ozma's Tip personality, a separate soul that resided in Ozma's subconscious, survives and changes his name to Pete, befriending Amy when he is able to take control of Ozma's body.

   In Disney's 1985 fantasy film

   , Ozma is the rightful ruler of Oz who has been hidden away in a palace mirror. It is revealed in the end of the film that her father was the king of Oz before the Wizard came, yet the witch Mombi somehow made Ozma her slave. When the Nome King took over Oz and promised Mombi the heads of 30 beautiful women (to switch heads with) if she kept the princess a secret, Mombi imprisoned her in mirror within the palace throne room of the

   cellar
   . She rescued Dorothy from the clinic, but Nurse Wilson discovered them trying to escape the property and chased after them, resulting in both of the two girls falling into the nearby river during a thunderstorm. Ozma vanished underwater, and seemingly drowned; presumably she returned to her position in Oz, which was back inside the mirror.

   Later she showed a lost Dorothy the way out of Mombi's mirrored labyrinth after Dorothy was caught stealing the
   Powder of Life
   from Mombi's head cabinet containing her original head. After the Nome King was destroyed and Oz was fully restored to its original state, the curse on Ozma was broken and Dorothy helped her step out of the glass mirror. Afterwards, Ozma finally took her position as the true ruler of Oz.

   Ozma then used the Ruby Slippers to send Dorothy back to Kansas, saying she would look in on her from time to time and take her back to Oz if she ever wished to return. Sometime later Dorothy saw Ozma in the bedroom vanity mirror of the new farmhouse Uncle Henry had built to replace the one the
