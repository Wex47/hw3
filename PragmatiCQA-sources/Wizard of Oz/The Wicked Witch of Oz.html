   Reilly &amp; Lee

   In the eleventh chapter of her book, Cosgrove Payes has her character Leon the Neon tell how he came to be. He was once, he states, an ordinary Quadling man, who showed his "special red hens" at a fair and won first prize — which turned out to be a home electrical kit. While trying to wire his home, the Quadling farmer got into a terrible tangle of wires; there was shock and he was transformed into neon.

   Robert Stanton Baum
   was, as a boy, an enthusiast about electricity, and wired the family home with his circuits and devices. (See:
