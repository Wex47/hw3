   Lurline the Fairy Queen, is a fictional character created by L. Frank Baum, author and creator of the Oz legacy. She is a figure of mystery, the one mostly responsible for the invention of fairy lands and the sole creator of Oz. Yet despite her glory and power, Lurline has very little to do with the land of oz as she looms in the shadows of the Oz stories, only being mentioned rarely, if ever.
  </p>
  <p key="1e8493a1-a33b-4b3b-98fa-669af8b10efb">
   Lurline is rarely ever seen, and for the few who are lucky enough to have laid eyes upon her, Lurline is described as being extremely beautiful, divine and luminous and the size of a giant. the most beautiful, most breathtaking and most divine being in her own parallel universe. Being brighter than the burning sun and bigger than the glowing moon with eyes that twinkle like "falling stars shooting past Jupiter and Mercury and the many Heavens above."
  </p>
  <p key="e74f5b62-9687-44bb-9107-4af5774dd48f">
   She is seen as a "Goldly" figure. And the creator of many other fantasy realms besides Oz which are also cut off from the real world after she enchants them with her fairy magic. Lurline does not interfere with what happens in Oz, good or bad and though she is a good Fairy Queen, she is rather indifferent about Oz's fate because she is said to be much too busy creating other lands and attending to more important duties in other realms and universes of the unknown. Lurline has many fairy children, who are the guardian angels to the lands Lurline has enchanted. They keep the lands, such as Oz beautiful and fresh, bringing the light cool breezes to hot sunny places, and carry the pollen which can be found within the spring flowers and little buttercups. They tend to the dying plants in the lands and nurse them back to health and create the moist morning due to feed the green grass that grows.

   Baum's works set in
   Burzee
   introduced a different fairy queen by the name of
   Lulea
   who shared many similarities with Lurline, with later authors even replacing her with Lurline, making many suspect that they were one and the same, but this was never made clear.

   Lurline and her band of fairies came upon the Land of Oz, and seeing that the rectangular country was cut off from the rest of the world by desert on all sides, she put an enchantment on the country. The enchantment made Oz into a fairyland, and prevented all within it from dying. It also allowed animals to speak and be as sensible as humans. (

   During her time in Oz, she came upon a race called the
   Flatheads
   , and as she felt sorry for them for having only half a brain, she gave each of them a can filled with the remaining half brain, so that the Flatheads could be as intelligent as everyone else. This lead to some infighting over cans of brains over the centuries, however. (

   She also bestowed the Crown Magic upon the people of the little kingdom of
   Halidom
   . This consisted of three golden circlets. Circlet One gave great wisdom to the Halidonians, while Circlet Two gave them great physical strength, and Circlet Three made them skillful in handicrafts. All the circlets were to be worn by the king. She also left a fairy unicorn in the care of that kingdom. (

   In a few versions and takes on the backstory of Oz, Lurline's character is romanticized. Many versions of her history have been altered or changed like much of the character's history in Oz has over time. Mostly due to the movie adaptations of Oz that glanced over Oz's past Royal-Reign and ancestry completely. But the most popular history that has been believed and put together in the fourteen original Oz stories by

Now it is rumored that Pastoria was also once in love with an exceedingly beautiful enchantress named Lurline, the Fairy Queen who processed great magical powers only for good and is credited for making Oz a fairy country by enchanting it and cutting it from the rest of the world centuries ago.

   When she first descended down from the heavens above, she carefully chose the land where she wanted to make Oz, Lurline used her magic to create it's breathtaking landscapes, making sparkling rivers and rocky mountains with high waterfalls, pine-filled forests and thick jungles, rainforests, vast hills, and colorful flowery meadows. And after it was finished, Lurline, Pastoria and the people of the Fairy Kingdom lived amongst all of these lovely sights for a long time in harmony and bliss. Lurline would later close off the land of Oz from the entire world, making it invisible.

After that Lurline left the land of Oz to continue enchanting other lands and created other realms similar to Oz. She put Pastoria in charge which entitled him to Oz's Throne and left Ozma in his care before parting ways for good and ultimately disappearing forever and into the unknown to carry on with new duties accompanied by her band of fairy children.

Now, widowed and left on his own with a baby infant and without the guidance of Lurline, Pastoria was not a very powerful King and was only getting older. He lived in a rather small Kingdom in the middle of the land. His people were happy and content as his subjects, but the land of Oz was still inhabited by two

   The Witches were very powerful indeed and could do as ever they pleased to anyone or thing that was unlucky to cross the Witches' paths. These Witches cast many spells upon innocent people, turning them into random houses or kitchen objects such as flower pots or candlesticks. The Wicked Witches tried many, many times to overthrow Pastoria and take over all of Oz as a whole. Unfortunately, Pastoria himself did not know anything about practicing the magic arts, for he depended on his Queen Lurline's magic. So he could not defend himself or his people, the Witches in Oz could have easily taken over and stole the King's Throne and enslaved his subjects to their own pleasing. The only thing that stopped them from truly doing so, was the other two Good Witches of the North and South who lived with the

   One random day, out of the clear blue sky, suddenly a large air-craft of sorts came descending down from the clouds up above, it slowly came to the ground and landed in the exact center of Oz. The people of Oz, Pastoria's subjects and even the Witches of Oz themselves had never seen such a peculiar invention. Inside the basket that was attached to the giant balloon was a man, he called himself Oscar Diggs and enthusiastically introduced himself as a great Wizard and Magician. And the people of oz believed him as they saw him perform magic tricks right before they're very eyes. The people of Oz asked if the Wizard would be the ruler of the land and he agreed that he would look after Oz and someday rid the land of its Wicked Witches if they promised to obey his every wish and demand. The people of Oz were gullible people and believed him and his promises. Thus, building the famous Emerald City in his honor and constructing the yellow brick road that leads to the main entrance.

   Long before humans and trees and trolls existed, a male and female troll traveled back through time from the magic of a sorcerer, to see who had come first - man or woman. Lurline, seeing them squabbling, their conflict not resolved, she offered them a contest. She would teach them how to create a world, and then they would both create something. Whichever's creation is longer lasting would be the winner. The male created a skeleton, which was dead and so could not die; and the woman created an evergreen weave, which was eternally alive. Lurline declared both a failure, and sent them back to their own time. But Lurline was soon killed by the ghosts of her own creations, and lay dead in Oz.

   Magical Mimics

However, he failed to notice that people were already present in that land, since they were much shorter than in other places, and he was as tall as any tree, as well as rather shortsighted due to old age. Upon discovering that, he built himself a palace and ordered people to stay away from it. However, he still maintained limited contact; it was stated that he taught the people of the Magic Land the art of writing, and a millenium or two after his arrival, he helped them defeat a witch named Arachna (which occured five thousand years before the main events of the books). By the time the books begin, he is dead for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and only a few people know of him.
