   Baum had never worked as a window trimmer; he drew upon his early experiences in the theater, as well as his five years' experience in the chinaware trade, for inspiration in window trimming. He advocated rich imagination and fantasy, and spaciousness as opposed to clutter. He was enthusiastic about mechanical displays that endowed window displays with motion, which forced passing crowds to stop and watch. Yet Baum also stipulated that the purpose of good-quality window dressing was to promote commercial success, to move merchandise and sell goods, rather than any aesthetic or other goal.

   Baum wrote much of the periodical's text himself, but also sought contributions from fellow members of the Chicago Press Club. The magazine was illustrated with photographs of window displays (many of his own taking), plus artwork by the city's newspaper artists, including

   Along with the journal, Baum also founded the National Association of Window Trimmers of America, and was chosen the secretary of the group's first convention in August 1898. The journal also produced an offshoot book,
