Sometime before this occurred, monopolizing the castle abandoned by Snow White and Regina, Zelena threatened to harm Aurora, Prince Phillip, and their baby. Zelena agrees to not hurt them as long as they give her valuable information. When they tell her of the return of Storybrooke's residents, she sends flying monkeys to get blood from Regina, who are successful in procuring the blood. When a flying monkey attacks Regina and Roland (the son of Robin Hood), Regina transforms the monster in plush. Belle who had read

Unknown to the pair, whoever resurrects the Dark One will lose their life. Shortly after Neal opens the vault, he begins dying while Rumplestiltskin is resurrected.

Then she approaches to touch Snow White's belly and promises the child will soon be hers. Snow White learns from Glinda the good witch to defeat Zelena they need a wielder of light magic(which is Emma) but the only way to get to Emma is to cast the Dark Curse.  Zelena interferes with the curse being cast by Snow White and Regina by dropping a forgetting potion into the mixture, which will erase their memories of the past year in the Enchanted Forest. Victorious, she flies off back to the castle to ingest a substance to retain her memories. Zelena then hands the same vial to Rumplestiltskin; daring him to keep his memories or be foolish enough to want to forget.Before she is sent to Storybrooke with the others she sent Walsh, whom she had turned into a winged monkey many years earlier after uncovering his charade as the Great and Powerful Wizard, to live in New York City in his human form. There, he is to seduce and occupy the Savior (Emma who Zelena believes is the only person who can defeat her), who is also living in New York amnesic after the battle against Peter Pan.

   As part of a plot twist, it is revealed she time traveled to the past and killed Robin Hood's wife Marian in order to take her place using a magical six-leaf clover necklace. Not knowing of the switch, Emma and Hook brought her into the present time to be with Robin. As this false Marian, she either knowingly or unknowingly ate ice cream cursed by the Snow Queen named Ingrid which almost made her freeze to death. With knowing this is a magical curse, Robin decided to take her and his son to the world without magic outside of Storybrooke where it cannot affect her. As Mr. Gold is in the outside world (after being banished by Belle for his misdeeds), he suffers a heart attack as he instructs Robin to steal a healing elixir from a store called "Wizard of Oak". Robin gives Gold what he thinks is the right bottle, but Zelena reveals her true self to explain that she switched it with a cold remedy. She agrees to give him the real one if only he stops trying to kill her and he helps her get a happy ending through the author of the fairy tales. Weeks later in Storybrooke, Regina calls Robin's phone to have the false Marian answer as she changes to Zelena and reveals the truth to her. As parting words, Zelena vows they will see each other again soon.

    Personality
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="d578597e-7b03-4059-8d0f-eeed4790106d">
   Zelena is mainly characterized by her unhealthy envy towards Regina (who combined with her unstable magic drastically changed the color of her skin making it green), to which she releases her anger and her hatred for being abandoned to her birth by Cora and having been put aside by Rumplestiltskin when the latter decided to choose her younger half sister to cast the Dark Curse, despite Zelena herself being much more gifted and adept at the gift of magic.
  </p>
  <p key="4f746848-1ebe-4796-b187-8ea795539955">
   Removed this feature, however, it is clear that Zelena actually feels very lonely and in the depths of her heart is always looking for someone who accepts and loves her unconditionally because she has always been abused both verbally and physically by her adoptive alcoholic father. Because of this when she met Glinda and entered the coven of the 4 witches protecting Oz, she even gave up looking for revenge against Regina and Rumple (to the point that her skin had returned to normal). However, the unexpected arrival of Dorothy Gale and her inclusion in the coven, together with the discovery of what is written in Glinda's book of prophecies and her paranoia that the child herself would have defeated her, report Zelena on the her dark path once again.

     Witchcraft
    </b>
    : The magical ability to cast spells and/or curses. In particular Zelena is described as an extremely gifted witch because she is the only one to be born already equipped with the ability to use magic, while both Cora and Regina have spent many years learning and mastering all their skills and that's why Zelena is much more powerful than both (as well as one of the most powerful sorcerers of all realms).  Among the powers she used more are listed:

     Laws of Magic
    </b>
    : Like any magician or sorcerer, Zelena is subject to the laws of magic, as a result she is unable to raise the dead, create love and time travel. However, she managed to find a loophole for the latter law by creating a spell that allowed her to travel back in time.

     Oz Pendant
    </b>
    : Initially, the life and powers of Zelena were inextricably linked to the pendant given to her by Glinda as a member of the sorceress of the witches of Oz, so much so that if someone had removed it, she would have completely lost her powers and would have left her completely helpless (making her essentially a

    Zelena is the second most recurring villain of the series (after Rumplestiltskin), having appeared as the main antagonist in the second narrative arc of season 3 and having played the role of secondary antagonist in seasons 4, 5 and 6.

    There is a bicycle with a basket in Zelena's porch, which references Miss Gulch, the Wicked Witch of the West's Kansas counterpart, from the 1939

    Alchemical signs for the four elements are carved into the table and the stone pillars where Zelena and her fellow sister witches are gathered. Fittingly enough, the element of Wicked Witch of the West (downward-pointing triangle) is water, which is also associated with the west.

    Although she has been cast aside for Regina's favor as she not have a noble heritage, Zelena is most prone to behave, in a disturbingly similar way, as her mother Cora, despite she has not been raised by her.

    The design on Zelena's compass is the same as the witches' table in Oz except that the colors are different. The back on the chairs around the table and the illustration on the cover of the Book of Records have the same design.

    Despite that her adoptive mother seemed to love her, Zelena had no qualms against changing her past so that they never met, still seeing again Cora as her mother despite her resentment against her.

    It is unknown whether or not she knows (or cares) who her biological father is as she is mostly focused on her mother. Though, despite their mutual hatred for each other, she still see's the woodcutter as her father (even if is unknown what happened to the latter after Zelena completely embraces her wicked nature and use the magic to subdue and terrify the whole realm of Oz).

    The character of Zelena and the Oz arc during the second-half of third season (2014) are allusions to the film
    Oz: The Great and Powerful
    released just in the 2013 year.
    Zelena herself, despite being an alternative version of
