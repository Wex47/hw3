One day while doing her daily farm chores, she finds a key thanks to Billina the hen in the barn that has "Oz" engraved in it after seeing a magic shooting star the night before. Dorothy is strongly convinced it is from Oz and that her old friends may all be sending her a sign saying that they're in trouble. Concerned for Dorothy's mental state, a worried Aunt Em takes her to a psychiatric clinic and seeks the help of a professional therapist at an asylum so she can sleep again.

   Dr. Worley
   , (Nicol Williamson) listens to her story about Oz and after questioning Dorothy a few times, he forcefully uses electroshock therapy her to cure her of all her Oz "delusions". Aunt Em must return to the farm before nightfall. She sadly kisses her niece goodbye and tells Dorothy that she will back for her the next day when Dr. Worley is done treating her as his patient, and she even promises to bring Toto. Dorothy objects and after her aunt leaves is taken to a dark and empty waiting room by the head nurse, Nurse Wilson, (Jean Marsh) a stern faced woman dressed all in black. There she meets a mysterious and pretty young girl (Emma Ridley) around her age, who appeared to come out of nowhere. She is barefoot, dressed in an old fashioned hospital gown of all white with blonde hair. She asks Dorothy why she was brought to the hospital, the two discuss their well-earned misgivings, and the girl gives her a gift of a little pumpkin with a carved face as Halloween is right around the corner. Suddenly, screaming and yelling can be faintly heard in the background somewhere in the hospital. When Dorothy turns her back for a second, the strange girl disappears and when Dorothy turns around to look again, she sees that the girl is gone and she is once again left all alone in solitude.

   Hours later Nurse Wilson finally fetches Dorothy accompanied by Hospital staff. They restrain her against her will and she is rolled away down the halls of the hospital on a to a little room where the electroshock machine is held. Just as Dr. Worley is about to use it on her, a thunderstorm hits which causes the power to go out, rendering the terrifying machine useless. Dr. Worley and Nurse Wilson leave to check the generator. Dorothy is left all alone in the dark again, and the screams and cries in the distance can be heard more clearly now. Shortly after the girl Dorothy met earlier mysteriously arrives to help her quickly escape, revealing that the screaming she heard wasn't just her imagination but real. Dr. Worley's machines have mentally damaged and driven most of his patients mad and insane. The girl also says that he, along with the help of Nurse Wilson, has locked them all away in the

   The two girls run in fear for their lives and flee the hospital grounds, out into the night storm as lightning strikes and thunder fills the sky. They accidentally slip down a muddy landslide and fall into a raging river nearby. They try to hold on to a large branch but it breaks off and they are pulled into the current further and further away downstream. Nurse Wilson jumps into the water to try and grab one of them but is unsuccessful.
The mystery girl seemingly drowns as she is pulled underwater while Dorothy luckily finds an old wooden chicken coop, large enough to fit inside, which was floating nearby. She grabs ahold of it, climbs safely inside like a baby in a cradle and falls fast asleep as it floats off into the abyss carried by the strong current and into the unknown.

   The next day, the storm is over and the sun shines bright. A sleeping Dorothy wakes up nice and dry to find herself still in the coop that is floating upon a small muddy pond. She suddenly hears the cluck of a chicken and sees Billina at her side in the coop. Strange enough, she can magically talk, and Dorothy realizes that she must be in a fairy land, possibly even Oz.

   They notice that they are not in Kansas anymore, and once the small pond dried up they both see they are surrounded by nothing but sand and large rocks that stretches out on every side of them. Dorothy also takes caution and remembers that if she is back in Oz, it's four corners are surrounded by a great and vast deadly desert that separates it from the real world. Anything living that touches it dies and instantly turns to grains of sand. Dorothy carefully climbs out of the coop, balances on rocky stones so she doesn't touch the sand, and hops to the land nearby. It is awaiting them is a grassy green meadow filled with rich trees and little flowers. They finally make it safely on the shore, go exploring, and see if Dorothy can find any of her old friends to reunite with, specifically the

   Mombi takes Dorothy by the hand and tells Tik-Tok and Billina to stay and wait outside of her dressing rooms. Dorothy is taken down a long, immense hallway of locked cabinets, each constructed of solid gold and glass with a head of an attractive girl inside who stares emotionless at Dorothy. Mombi switches her head and picks head #4, which has dark wavy hair in an updo with porcelain skin and a mature expression. She then explains to Dorothy that the Nome King conquered the Emerald City. Then he collected all of his emeralds back, kidnapped the Scarecrow, and took him to his Nome mountain before turning every living thing in Oz to stone. She, looking at Dorothy strangely, then pursues her and says that she isn't beautiful but has a unique look, different from her other heads and has a "certain prettiness". She tells her that she will proceed to lock her away for a few years until her head is fully grown and ready. Then she'll take it to add to her collection. Dorothy objects and cries out for Billina and Tik-Tok to help. They try to stop Mombi, but Tik Tok freezes as his action winds down at the last second stopping him dead in his tracks. Mombi laughs at them cruelly and she takes Dorothy and Billina up a long staircase in a passageway, opened by a secret trapdoor. She locks them in the room in the top of the highest tower filled with old antique dÃ©cor and dusty furniture covered in cobwebs. Now virtual prisoners, they meet the sweet and gentle

And Dorothy walks across the room and unlocks Cabinet 31 in Mombi's hall of head. Her original head and Powder of Life are in there, surrounded by other magic potions and Voodoo dolls. While reaching for the powder, Dorothy accidentally knocks something over, waking up Mombi who begans screaming, "DOROTHY GALE" This wakes up all of the other heads in her collection and they began screaming too. The head lurches forward and tries to bite Dorothy's hand when she grabs the container that holds the Powder of Life.

She quickly dodges it, runs off, and returns to the top of the tower. Tik-Tok's thinking has run down, causing him to go bonkers and rant complete nonsense as he speaks gibberish while bouncing around the room, slowing down the process. After Dorothy winds him up again, she says the magic words and uses the powder to bring the Gump to life. They all escape moments after Mombi, with her original head, enters the room. they fly over the ruins of the Emerald city and towards the direction of the Nome King's mountain which is straight ahead.

They do as they are told, but when the Gump flies over the shores of the land and above the

The seven remaining ones return to Mombi's castle within the city empty handed. Furious, Mombi has the Wheelers pull her to the Nome King's mountain using a tunnel underneath the Deadly Desert.Â The next day, the Gump begins to fall apart, as the rope holding the sofas together snaps, resulting in him, Dorothy, Tik-Tok, Jack, and Billina crashing down, falling from the sky onto the Nome King's mountain. Jack's head falls off in the process, and Billina hides in it before it is reattached. The Gump's head is tied back to the sofa so he can walk.

   The Nome King (Nicol Williamson) suddenly appears right before them on the high cliff above, having his face imprinted and visible to the eye as he is also a part of the mountains' rock wall. Dorothy politely tells him that she and her companions are there to conquer him, he causes an earthquake and makes the ground split apart and break, causing them to fall into his underground throne room of rocks and treasures.

  <p key="c69b1a8c-6922-4993-9a52-0ad20c4122cb">
   The Nome King loudly explains the situation from his point of view as Dorothy falls deeper and deeper, like Alice down the Rabbit Hole, into the Earth, passing dazzling jewels and other rare gems made for him by his Nomes. Once she finally reaches the bottom she is briefly reunited with the Scarecrow, (Justin Case) but for only less than a mere second before he is transformed within the blink of an eye into an ornament and teleported away by the Nome King to add to his decorated collection room. The Nome King tells Dorothy that the Scarecrow stole his emeralds from him first, and that all the ones in the city really belonged to him first as they were all from his mountain to begin with. And he was just rightfully taking them all back. Dorothy argues that they were already there long before the Scarecrow got his brains and became the King of the city. The Nome King decides to let the group each have three guesses as to which ornament the Scarecrow is, and if they guess right, he will be restoredÂ and they all will be allowed to leave his mountain. He tells them to enter his ornament room and try to find the Scarecrow, and when they think they've found the ornament he's turned into to touch it and call out 'Oz'.

   The Gump goes first, mumbles to himself, and complains the whole way down the entrance. Meanwhile the Nome King sits on his rock throne as he smokes his pipe and shows hospitality to his guests and caters a yummy refreshment for them all, limestone pie and hot melted silver. When the Gump ends up guessing wrong three times, he is turned into an ornament. Dorothy tries to argue with this, but the Nome King makes it clear he expects them all to play or he'll send them to his 'fiery furnace'.Â On Jack Pumpkinhead's turn, he is also unsuccessful. Each time someone becomes an ornament, the Nome King becomes more and more human like in appearance.

And he also confesses to her that their magical powers gave him the ability to conquer the Emerald City, destroy Oz, and do as he pleased to its people. When she was sent back into the real world, she was so anxious and excited to get back to Kansas, they slipped off her feet and landed on the top of the Nome King's mountain and into the wrong hands. Dorothy sadly realizes that what has happened to Oz is part of her fault.

   Seconds later the Nome messenger appears to tell the Nome King that Tik-Tok has seemingly wound down before he can make his last guess, and therefore is standing perfectly still in the middle of the room. So he sends Dorothy in to wind him back up, and while she is there, among the ornaments, she can guess for herself. The Nome King sends Dorothy in, but as she enters he offers to use the ruby slippers and send her home instead. He tells her that no-one can help her friends and promises that if she returns to Kansas now she will never think of Oz again, reminding her that "There's no place like home".

   Dorothy declines the Nome King's offer and bravely walks into the room with determination to find Tik-Tok and guess correctly. Tik-Tok reveals to her that he never really wound down and wanted to get her in so she could see which ornament he turns into because they might receive a clue from it to guess correctly and win the game. After saying their goodbyes, Tik-Tok makes his final guess and disappears, however his plan doesn't work as he is transported to a different part of the room with Dorothy not seeing what he was turned into. Meanwhile, Mombi arrives at the Nome King's mountain and is made to kneel in front of him. Mombi triesÂ to warn him about Dorothy only for him to taunt her that he already knows about Dorothy and that she'll soon be taken care of. As Dorothy fails on her first two guesses, Mombi asks what will happen if Dorothy guesses right and learns about

Dorothy closes her eyes and chooses a random ornament, but just before she can take her guess she sees a big green emerald laying on a table and is drawn to that instead. She makes her third guess and is successful, restoring the Scarecrow.

   She realizes that it is green ornaments she is looking for, as green is the mascot color of Oz. Meanwhile the Nome King realizes what's happened and becomes consumed with fury. After trapping Mombi in a cage as punishment for letting Dorothy escape, he leaves to deal with her directly. With the Scarecrow's help they restore the Gump to normal. The Nome King appears to stop the game in a giant form as Scarecrow only just manages to stop a green vase from smashing, which Dorothy restores back into Jack. The Nome King ends the game unfairly and tries to eat the Gump but Jack, the Scarecrow, and Dorothy grab hold to his antlers and save his head so the Nome King only eats the sofa he was attached to. He then tries to eat Jack, as the group runs away while Nome monsters who all look like demons come out of the walls trying to claw at and catch hold of them.

   The Nome King finally gets hold of Jack, but as he is about to eat him he freezes in terror at the sound of Billina clucking. From out of Jack's head an egg Billina laid (her first ever) rolls out and down the Nome King's throat. As he starts to crumble, he expresses his surprises that all this time Dorothy didn't know that eggs are poison to Nomes. He then disintegrates in flames of red smoke and fire, leaving a pile of rocks and boulders. Nothing is left but the ruby slippers, Dorothy sees them sparkle under the rubble and takes them back. Suddenly the Nome King's mountain begins to collapse and cave in causing havoc all around with things crashing and tumbling around. Quickly Dorothy takes her shoes off and puts the slippers on then, holding the hands of her friends, wishes out loud everyone in the mountain from Oz to be sent back, and to restore the Emerald City and its inhabitants to normal. She closes her eyes and clicks her heels together three times.

   Everyone reappears in aÂ grassy meadow, including Mombi still in her cage,Â and watch asÂ the Emerald City restores to its former green beauty. Dorothy realizes that Tik-Tok was never found but Billina notices a green medal on the Gump's antlers, which turns out to be his disguise as an ornament. After Dorothy returns him to his original form, they all go to the Emerald City to meet its citizens who eagerly await them.

   The Wheelers apparently turn nice and behave good, as they are no longer Mombi's slaves and are free. They are happy and among those in the huge coronation while celebrating and cheering in a parade inside the city. Dorothy rides on the Cowardly Lion, smiles, and waves to the citizens she saved. The Tin Woodman and Scarecrow walk on each side. All of the characters of Oz can be seen marching in the parade, such as the

The Scarecrow gives her his dented up silver crown that he wears on his head for she may accept the offer. But she decides to not be selfish and do the right thing which is to return to her home in Kansas, Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and of course, Toto.

   Dorothy wishes she could be in both places at the same time when suddenly the same mysterious girl that she met in the hospital and was lost in the river appears in a giant mirror dressed elegantly in a emerald green gauzy ball gown and adorned in precious jewels and crystals. Recognizing her, she walks towards Dorothy gracefully with a friendly smile. Dorothy helps her carefully step out of the mirror and to her side. The curse is then broken. Dorothy tells her how beautiful she is and is glad she did not drown after all. She is revealed to be the long lost

   The dancing slave girls, now with their heads rightfully back on, explain her history. Her father was the King of Oz before the Wizard arrived. She was enslaved by Mombi, enchanted, and trapped in the mirror when the Nome King promised her 30 beautiful young heads as a gift if she agreed to his deal. Jack Pumpkinhead suddenly then remembers that it was her who created him, which would make her his real mother. He is so relieved to find his true mother that he passes out and faints as the people around him catch him before he hits the ground. Mombi is still trapped in the iron cage, completely powerless for all eternity.

   Ozma declares that a witch with no magic is a miserable creature indeed and forgives Mombi. Dorothy gives Ozma the ruby slippers as she places them on her feet while she takes back her kingdom and sits on her royal green and gold velvet throne as the Scarecrow glady resigns as King. Ozma prepares to uses the slippers and Dorothy back to Kansas, telling her she will always look in on her from time to time and bring her back to Oz if she ever wishes to return again to visit in the future.

   Billina decides not to return to Kansas after all, seeing how nice Oz truly is now that things are good again and knowing that there is nothing for her in Kansas. Ozma clicks her heels, andÂ Dorothy quickly says heartfelt goodbye to all of her new and old friends and promises to never forget any of them as she is enveloped in a bright light.

   Once Dorothy returns home to Kansas, she wakes up and is found by Toto by the muddy riverbank. He is followed by none other than Aunt Em, Uncle Henry and a Kansas search party. Aunt Em tells her that the hospital was tragically struck by lightning and burned to the ground. Everybody was rescued except Dr. Worley who ran back in to save his machines. Just then a black jail cart driven by a policeman passes them. To Dorothy's surprise, an angry looking Nurse Wilson is imprisoned in it, similar to Mombi's fate in Oz.

   Later, the new farmhouse is finally finished. And Dorothy finally has a room of her own again. Ozma magically comes to visit her in her bedroom. She and Billina appear in Dorothy's vanity mirror smiling. This indicates that her adventures in Oz were not just a delusion or a dream, though Ozma does not want Aunt Em to know, keeping everything between Dorothy and her a secret.

   The story ends with Dorothy being much happier again as things seem much more hopeful and brighter. She is seen running out onto the yard, playing and giggling with Toto.

   The film was shot in England, on London sound stages plus some exteriors on Salisbury Plain. Freddy Francis, the project's original cinematographer, left after four weeks, unable to agree with director Murch; Francis was replaced by David Watkin. The result was the Francis shot the Kansas material, while Watkin shot Oz. The shoot fell behind schedule, and rumors held that Disney executive Richard Berger wanted to fire Murch. Murch's friends in the business, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg, visited the set to provide encouragement.

  <p key="46178f0a-a857-4f2e-9335-f37edd408270">
   Kurtz worried that the script was too dark, and solicited Murch for revisions. Murch was unenthusiastic, but allowed new writers to be brought in to inject humor and a lighter tone. Little of their work survived into the finished product, however.

   The Disney studio regime changed twice during the making of the film. By the time it was ready for audiences, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg were in charge of the company. Kurtz later complained that their new regime abandoned the film, neglecting to promote it effectively, since it was not one of their projects. (Still, Kurtz recognized that the main problem with it was its grim and "morose" tone.) It cost $24,000,000 to make, but earned only half that sum at the box office.
