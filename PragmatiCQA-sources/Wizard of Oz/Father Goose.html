   : Denslow drew pictures for Baum's verses, but Baum also wrote or revised his verse in response to Denslow's pictures. The two men also financed the work, largely if not totally. Publisher Hill was not originally willing to risk his own money on an odd project by two relative unknowns — though as the book developed Hill seems to have become more convinced of its value, and injected some of his own funds into the project. In the end Baum and Denslow paid for the artistic aspects of the work, the color plates, the book's cover, even the advertising. Hill paid for the paper, binding, and distribution costs. As a result, Denslow and Baum retained ownership of the color plates.

   To save money, Baum and Denslow had the book hand-lettered rather than printed.
   Ralph Fletcher Seymour
   was primarily responsible for the lettering; he was assisted by

   The book was published on 25 September 1899, in time for the Christmas season. The quality of the illustrations was far beyond anything that had been done in children's books up to that time. The book met with critical as well as popular success; Mark Twain and William Dean Howells were among the literary figures who praised it. The initial printing of 5700 copies sold out quickly; a second printing of 10,000 came in October 1899, and subsequent printings followed.

   Alberta Neiswanger Hall
   for 26 of the poems. It sold well. Other knock-offs, including a Father Goose calendar and a musical stage version with composer
   Paul Tietjens
   , failed to materialize — though Baum did bring out

   Baum's poetry exploits the ethnic stereotypes that were considered acceptable humor in his day, but which have passed very far out of favor now.  Baum used some of his royalties to buy a summer house at Matacawa, Michigan; he named the house the Sign of the Goose, and decorated it with goose motifs.

   After a few short years, though, the vogue for the book has passed. The George M. Hill company went out of business in 1902, and Baum and Denslow found it difficult to interest any other publisher in

   , which took over other early Baum books from Hill, finally issued a seventh edition, of 5250 copies, in 1905. (500 of those were for the English market.) This edition did not sell out for some years, and the company, then Bobbs-Merrill, did not reprint it. Instead the firm sold the rights to the Chicago reprint house M. A. Donahue Co., which kept the book in print into the 1920s.
