   The palace in the Emerald City is the most noble and luxurious establishment in all of Oz. Queen Ozma's palace is said to be four stories high with three flights of stairs and has seven passages which lead to the court room and it's Royal chambers. Before entering one must always wipe their feet on a plush green rug before being allowed to pass.
  </p>
  <p key="962c4025-82a3-4875-8f07-cd3112fdcfed">
   Some sections of the palace are entirely constructed out of all mirrored glass, reaching from the ground and stretching up to the ceilings. The floors and walls are all mirror, so one will find themselves completely surrounded by their own reflection at every angle wherever direction they look. In every room and hallway, giant chandeliers hang beautifully from the emerald studded ceilings.
  </p>
  <p key="fcbe104d-b977-4ba0-8498-87e16eaf9f31">
   All of the chambers in the palace have lots of décor all chosen in good taste that is decorated with glittering gems, solid gold clocks and thousands of emeralds. The rooms are private suites, filled with rich green carpet, green satin draperies with gold and silver tassels thst hang from them and dangling to the carpeted ground. Solid gold antique furniture encrusted with jewels and fancy fireplaces with mantles gorgeously cluttered with objects such as jeweled eggs and porcelain figurines. There are comfortable canopy beds filled with silk and satin bedding in every room, as well as a bathroom with a green marble tub and even a private sitting room. These rooms are all connected, making an apartment for each resident.
  </p>
  <p key="59ef999b-6786-4faf-89f1-fa4869ccadf8">
   Each bedroom and sitting room holds an elegant credenza and a wardrobe of gorgeous and handsome clothing that fits it's guest perfectly. The rooms are also filled with cozy velvet chairs, glass tables with sterling silver platters laid out which are filled with scrumptious treats to eat and bookshelves with many green books to read filled with funny illustrations. Many oil paintings of Oz's history hang upon the walls and attractive statues stand at every corner. Next to the draperies, delicate green marble vases are placed by the green tinted glass windows that are said to be filled with fresh blooming flowers. To complete the suites, electric green marble water fountains are placed in the center as the focal point of the rooms. Theses fountains spray green perfumed water high up into the air, so high in fact that the green water is said to almost reach the sparkling ceiling, all while filling the rooms with refreshing fragrances.

Bird baths are placed about for the birds who fly into the royal gardens and green marble benches are around to sit at to admire the scenery. Ozma is very found of her private garden, for it is where she goes to meditate and seek peace or simply just spend time with Dorothy, who is also her best friend.
