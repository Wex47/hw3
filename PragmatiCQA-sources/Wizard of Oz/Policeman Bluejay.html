   , have gone out to enjoy a picnic, but have gotten themselves lost in a "great forest." They encounter a malevolent magical being called a
   tuxix
   . Like the witch in a traditional fairy tale, the tuxix at first tries to entice the children; but the kids are wary, and are warned by a friendly bird overhead. The enraged tuxix then casts a spell on the children, transforming them into little bird-like beings, with their own heads but the bodies and limbs of skylarks. Policeman Bluejay, the force for order in the avian world of the forest, leads the two child-larks on a flight through the sky, and finds them shelter in an abandoned thrush's nest in a maple tree. With the help of a friendly eagle he retrieves their picnic basket (so that they don't have to eat bugs, worms, and grubs).

   Twinkle and Chubbins learn of their new maple-tree neighbors, a squirrel, an owl, and an o'possum; and Policeman Bluejay introduces them to the community of birds. The children see that the world of living beings in the forest has structure, relationships, and conflict. They hear stories of human cruelty to animals — and soon they witness it firsthand, when hunters enter the woods. The hunters kill Mrs. Possum and Mrs. Hootaway and Whisk the squirrel; Twinkle tries to protest, but she can only emit a skylark's chirp. The hunter's dog almost catches Twinkle — but she and Chubbins are rescued by their friend the eagle, who swoops down, kills the dog, and leads them to safety.

   for breakfast. (Baum acknowledges that animals have to prey upon each other to survive. Yet he maintains that "love" is the grand law of the forest.) Policeman Bluejay escorts the children to a safer location. Soon he takes them to the Paradise of Birds, where the contentions and violence of the forest never penetrate. The children are given a tour of its splendors, and meet the
   King Bird of Paradise
   . In the "suburbs" of the Paradise, the child-larks are introduced to the community of bees, and meet the Queen Bee; and they witness a spectacular flight of butterflies.

  <p key="75ba33be-e668-458c-b5e8-618db9147e57">
   Beyond the Paradise, in "the coarse, outer world," there is trouble in birdland: Policeman Bluejay must cope with a rebellion among the rooks, who want to make the other birds their slaves. By uniting, the smaller birds beat the rooks in a battle.

   The King Bird of Paradise and his Royal Necromancer have told the children that they can restore themselves to human form by eating a fruit called "tingle-berries." They do so, and return to their normal bodies — though Chubbins almost gets stuck halfway. Their adventure done, the children make their way home in the waning light of evening.

   Baum wrote a preface to his story, in which he makes his moral clear and unambiguous. He notes that along with the "amusement" the novel provides, he hoped it would inspire "a little tenderness for the helpless birds and animals" his young readers encountered in their lives. Baum recalled from his own childhood, and observed in his own sons, how harsh children can be to vulnerable animals.
