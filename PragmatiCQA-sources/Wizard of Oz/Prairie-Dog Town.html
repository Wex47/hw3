   The people of Edgeley, North Dakota hold a picnic in the bed of a little river, under a bridge (the only shade available in the treeless landscape).
   Twinkle
   and
   Chubbins
   wander off on their own, and come upon a prairie-dog community among the low hills. They are surprised to hear the creatures talk to them; the prairie dogs realize that as children, the two visitors are not a danger. The mayor and high priest of the town, Bowko, invites Twinkle and Chubbins for a visit and tour. He has the prairie-dog magician, Mr. Presto Digi, shrink the children down to prairie-dog size.

   Twinkle and Chubbins enjoy seeing the surprisingly sophisticated lifestyle of the underground community. Mrs. Puff-Pudgy welcomes them into her pleasantly-appointed home, with furniture, candles, and pictures on the walls. Later they attend a banquet at the mayor's burrow; they sample the vegetarian dishes of the prairie-dog's table. Their visit done, Presto Digi restores them to their normal size.
