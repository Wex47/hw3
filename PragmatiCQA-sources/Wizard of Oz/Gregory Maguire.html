   Maguire has published a score of works in children's literature, from
   <i key="ac1d6579-1297-4889-b4d2-3c2c49b263da">
    The Lightning Time
   </i>
   (1978) to
   <i key="56fd90cb-3f30-4f0b-9abe-1e75bb713065">
    What-the-Dickens: The Story of a Rogue Tooth Fairy
   </i>
   (2007). He has also written fantasy works for adults, which tend to take ironic, satiric, deconstructive approaches to the traditional fantasy literature. The title of his 1999 book
   <i key="1d8dfb74-4342-4d32-a012-30a14237c30e">
    Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister
   </i>
   shows this orientation. Maguire's reversal of the traditional Oz literature, in which the villainess becomes the heroine, takes a comparable approach.
