   The partnership was founded by
   W. Irving Way
   and
   Chauncey L. Williams
   in the spring of 1895. Both men were prominent Chicagoans, and intended to established a prestigious publishing house; Way visited William Morris at the Kelmscott Press in England in April 1895, to arrange for the American release of a Kelmscott Press book, Dante Gabriel Rossetti's

   Baum's book was attractively published (it was the first book ever illustrated by the young Parrish), though its relatively expensive price meant that its sales were limited. In general the firm was better at publishing fine books than it was at making a profit; Way &amp; Williams went out of business in 1898.
