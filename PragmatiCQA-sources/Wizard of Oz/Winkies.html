After that no one ever dared to try and overthrow the Wicked Witch who officially ruled the west for a very long time enslaving anyone who crossed her path. However, she met her fate when a little girl named

   she'd been wearing since her arrival in Oz, in hopes to enhance her own evil powers. Once she was gone, there was great rejoicing, and the day was set aside as an annual Holiday within the western quadrant. To thank Dorothy for being their Hero, the Winkies gladly restored the Scarecrow and gave him a golden cane to walk with and they polished and mended the tin body of the Tin Woodman until he was good as new. They also gave Dorothy a golden bracelet encrusted with diamonds and gave Toto a golden collar also decorated with diamonds.

Afterwards, the Tin Woodman finally returned to the west and has happily ruled over them ever since. He now lives in a "Tin Castle" that was built by the Winkies as a gift in his honor.

   , the Winkies did not strictly wear the color yellow as described in Baum's book. Instead they wore gray outfits with orange designs and black boots. They wore dark furred armor with tall furry hats. They also had green skin with unattractive facial features just like the Wicked Witch had, making it likely that they are of the same species.  This was possibly done due to the rise of dictators like Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini at the time, meaning that audiences would more likely recognize a tyrant whom enslaves their own people rather than an outside conqueror.

   , the Winkies were funny looking people who had very small eyes and mis-shaped faces, distorted in stitched leather and ugly cloth. They were clumsy at times (slipping or dropping things) and were so terrified of Evillene that even her walking passed had them trembling in fear. They were forced to work in Evillene's sweatshop with no breaks, until Dorothy finally destroyed Evillene. Once Evillene was gone, they shredded their current forms and break out into a joyous dance. (Many debate on whether they were normal looking people enslaved in costumes the whole time or they were shedding their old skins.)

   the Winkies appeared to be a merger of both the Broadway and Film versions. While having a slight resemblance to the 1975 versions, they had similar mannerisms to the movie Winkies. After Evillene is destroyed, they remove their old uniforms to reveal bright and colorful clothing a the celebrate the Witches death.
