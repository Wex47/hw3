   Born in South Africa, Langley was a novelist and playwright. His Hollywood screenwriting career began in 1936. He was chosen for the Oz project on the basis of his children's novel

   Florence Ryerson
   and
   Edgar Allan Woolf

   Samuel Goldwyn
   in February 1938.

   When Langley completed his draft on June 4th 1938, he believed that he had written the final version of the movie. He was incensed when he learned that Ryerson and Woolf were doing another re-write.

   considered the Ryerson/Woolf script too wordy, and brought Langley back to the project in August. Langley disliked the Ryerson/Woolf version; he found it "so cutesy and oozy that I could have vomited." Lyricist
   E.Y. Harburg
   backed and championed Langley with the producers. Langley cut Ryerson/Woolf materials from the script and restored as much of his own work as he could.

   He envisioned multiple characters that were removed by later screenwriters including
   Bulbo
   and his Kansas counterpart
   Walter Gulch
   , another girl from Kansas named Lizzie Smithers who accompanies Dorothy, Lion being a human named Florizel or Kenelm transformed into an animal by the Wicked Witch,  the lover of Lion named Princess Sylvia who is captured by the Wicked Witch so she may marry Bulbo instead with a Kansa counterpart being the niece of Miss Gulch, and a prototype of Professor Marvel called Dr. Pink who would've been called to check on Dorothy in Kansas after she returns.

   He had the Wicked Witch trying to invade the Emerald City with an army of "ten thousand men, four thousand wolves, and two hundred winged monkeys" with the men dressed in Japanese ceremonial armor. This was to make her son Bulbo King of the Emerald City with the intention of killing the Wizard.

   The Wizard would have been found out to be humbug before characters leave for the Witch's castle. The Witch could have either been killed in a swordfight with Lion changed back to human who also fights a
   dragon
   and a gorilla or by Dorothy melting her after she strikes Toto with her broom. The winged monkeys were to be controlled by the

   Among the fourteen or so writers who labored on the movie's script, Langley was one of the most important. It has been argued that the screenplay for
   <i key="29777a48-64ba-40b5-b002-127b0fd5fac2">

   was in the main the work of Langley, Ryerson, Woolf, and Harburg. Langley contributed the idea of Oz as a dream; Glinda arriving in a bubble; and characters from Kansas (except Professor Marvel) reappearing in Oz in different guises. Langley was responsible for the film's dedication, for

   Langley's first response to the completed film was negative. "I saw it in a cinema on Hollywood Boulevard at noon. And I sat and cried like a bloody child. I thought, 'This is a year of my life.' I loathed the picture. I thought it was dead. I thought it missed the boat all the way around. I had to wait for my tears to clear before I went out of the theater."
  </p>
  <p key="c34cbee7-dec6-46a8-baba-ba074cf8f9e5">
   Ten years later, though, Langley's opinion changed. He saw the film for a second time in England during its 1949 re-release. And then, "suddenly, I could see it objectively for the first time. And I thought, 'It's not a bad picture. Not a bad picture, you know.'"

   Langley continued to write for films, and later for television, after 1939. His career peaked in the early and middle 1950s, when he wrote the screenplay for
