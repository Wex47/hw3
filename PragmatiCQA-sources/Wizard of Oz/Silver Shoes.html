    In the book, even though the shoes are described as if constructed of real solid silver, due to being magic shoes in a magic realm, they are flexible, comfortable and easy to move in. They can never wear out and are accustomed to alter their size by shrinking or stretching to perfectly fit the current owner at the time they wear them.

   the Good Witch of the South tells Dorothy how the magic charm of the Silver Shoes work. She also reveals to Dorothy that they hold several mysterious powers inside them, this indicates that the shoes are able to do much more than carry people places. But what these other specific powers can do is left a mystery. The only charm that Baum does choose to elaborate upon about the pair, is that they can automatically take it's wearer wherever they wish to go in the entire world when the heels are knocked against each other three solid times and then given directions on call; the shoes will then take three fast steps so sudden that the wearer will travel in the wink of an eye with each step made. And to the desired destination in exactly three seconds no matter the distance.

   The shoes are the one thing the Witch wants above all else, both in the musical and Baum's book strictly for the pairs mysterious powers. But Elphaba wants the shoes for slightly different reasons than her movie counterpart. While in the MGM movie and Baum's book, the shoes were symbols of power and protection. In Maguire's reinvisonment the shoes are symbols of what Elphaba has secretly craved all her life; love, respect, acceptance, and family. Above all else, Nessa's shoes represent Elphaba's need to be accepted and considered important, particularly to her father. The shoes aren't just related to themes of family and acceptance, though. They also, as in the movie, represent beauty and authority. Interestingly, though, that becomes more of an excuse for Elphaba to justify her obsession with getting the shoes from Dorothy:

    Should she pursue Dorothy, should she snatch those shoes away – and what were her real motives? Was it to keep them out of the hands of the Wizard ... Or was it to snatch back some small shred of Frex's attention?" (5.10.1)

  </p>
  <p key="f28a3c11-95c2-43a4-ad19-98b50da5fdf0">
   Ultimately, Elphaba is the one who turns the shoes into something more than they really are. And other than considered dazzling to look at, the shoes really don't have much power at all.

   When Donald Gardner's parents tell him they'll be taking an exciting road trip through Kansas, he openly cringes. He is sure it will be a boring summer vacation. But at one of their final roadside stops on the way home, they are approached by a poor woman offering to sell a curious item—an antique shoe made out of solid silver. While Donald's mother is initially reluctant, she is ultimately smitten with the shoe and buys it.

   , and his teacher agrees the idea is not far-fetched considering author L. Frank Baum wrote about “silver shoes,” not ruby slippers, which were strictly in the movie. Yet when he accepts a dare from his two best buddies to try it on, frightening and incredible things begin to happen. Strange animals cry out in the night. Dark, shadowy shapes lurk in distant corners. Scratching sounds are heard just outside his bedroom window. And when he meets George Clarke, a reclusive man who has been in hiding and on the run for many years, Donald finds out there is a lot more to Baum's story than he thinks, and comes to discover that the Silver Shoe's are the same pair that a little farm girl named Dorothy wore during a fateful trip to another dimension known as Oz over one hundred years ago.

   would have been a coward forever. She is glad she never knew how to use them because she did meet her friends, their dreams came true, they had enough adventures together to last a lifetime, and they were to become kings. Dorothy mentioned how they had often wondered what the shoes could do. Glinda said that they can do many great and wonderful things, but the shoes' greatest power was to fulfill the wearer's deepest desire, and she asked Dorothy what she longed for most. Dorothy simply said her desire was to go home.

   Glinda instructed Dorothy that using the shoes was easy. She just needs to strike her heels together three times, make her wish, and home she will go. Dorothy practices clicking the heels twice, and is glad she is finally going home, but is sad to leave her friends. She says her goodbyes, picks up

No reason is given for this unconventional method of tapping the heals together. Perhaps it was easier to animate that action, or perhaps since Glinda's instructions were to "strike" the heels together, that may be because it had to be strike the heels together with some force to prevent accidental activation. (When she practiced clicking the heels together before, though, she did it the conventional way.) She commands the magic shoes to take her back home, and she screams with fright, and her friends appear frightened as well, as she is propelled into the air.

Aunt Em sees the shoe she currently has, and almost throws it out, thinking they're not really magic and Oz is just a story, but she decides she'd better not. She doesn't say why she changes her mind, but perhaps she thinks Dorothy would be upset because she still wants it as a keepsake, even if it is not magic, and may want to wear the shoes for the style if she finds the other one. Dorothy tries to look for the missing shoe, but is unable to find it in the field.

Uncle Henry and Aunt Em hear Toto bark like crazy and wonder if Dorothy is teasing him. But when they go to her room to see what's the matter, the window curtain is torn and Dorothy is gone, and her magic shoes were on the floor.
