   The game begins as Petra tries to break into a warehouse for possible evidence that would connect Lion to crimes. She sets off a poppy gas alarm and is knocked out only to wake up with her hand tied to a bridge as she is dangling from it. The Lion taunts her and  reveals that he covered up the warehouse evidence against him. He leaves as she looses the rope and happens to fall onto one of the Gumps (working as a taxi). She goes to her office and is visited by Dee Gale (
   Dorothy
   ) who needs help finding her fiancé Anzel who was last traced as being in

   . Petra talks to Tik Tok who is stationed at the North Gate towards Gillikin and learn that Anzel came into the Emerald City using a false name. Since he went to Betsy Bobbin's house, but however when Petra goes there,
   Hank
   the mule tells her that he only lets Betsy's boyfriends and those bringing deliveries in. She goes to the store called Scraps which is owned by the
   Patchwork Girl
   to buy some flowers for Betsy but encounters Lion as he settles a mafia-style agreement before he leaves. Petra buys specfic flowers (red and blue) and goes into Betsy's house to talk to her. Betsy says that Anzel did come briefly to hide out from authorites, but she called the guard
   Jinjur
   as that made him run away.

   Petra heads for the Royal University as Betsy tells her that Anzel works there. She speaks to the
   Wogglebug
   who tells her that Anzel works with his assistant named Cutter who plans field trips. She then talks to Tik Tok who tells her that Jinjur is investigating a case at the dock. When Petra arrives there, she finds Jinjur interrogating
   Captain Bill
   and

   as their boat exploded possibly due to magic. Petra finds a ruby cufflink near the scene that can't possibly belong to Bill or Trot so Jinjur lets them go. When asked about Anzel, Jinjur notes that he is a smuggler so that leads Petra to go to
   Jack Pumpkinhead
   who has never been busted for such. He claims to know nothing about Anzel so Petra heads back to her office to find Trot who wants to hire her to investigate the boat explosion so that Captain Bill is not arrested. Petra goes to

   's bar to ask Captain Bill about the explosion but he can't tell her much. She speaks to Ruggedo who the alibi that Bill and Trot were both there during the explosion. Petra heads back to the Dock and uses an umbrella she found left at the bar to pick up a piece of a pumpkin floating in the water. She asks Trot about this and reveals that they ship pumpkins to Gillikin Country for Jack Pumpkinhead. Since the area is known for illegal magic, she gives the sample to Toto who sniffs it finding traces of magic only after Petra sneaks out a knowledge pill by tricking the Woggle-bug with candy. He gives her a dog whistle to call him later and she goes back to the bar to confront Bill. He reveals that he only ships pumpkins for Jack because he gave him an illegal magic amulet to cure Trot from sickness and when the contraband was found, Jack testified at his trial which resulted in Bill being found not guilty. Bill also states that he helped hide Anzel for Jack, and when Jack is asked about his whereabouts, he refers her to the Scarecrow. It turns out the Scarecrow has been standing in front of her office and telling riddles about his identity and he sent Anzel to Ruggedo. He admits to transforming Anzel into a crystal decanter, it being the only spell he knows. In order for her to speak to Anzel, Ruggedo turns Petra into a coat hanger but Jinjur witnesses the magic leak out and arrests Ruggedo. She briefly talks to Anzel who admits that he isn't really engaged to Dee. Since the mirror happens to also be a transformed person, she tilts to help Petra read the spell called Ornamentov and change back to human. As she leaves the bar, a Gump waits as Dee requests to see her at the royal palace. Petra tells her everything but Dee mostly knows all except for the explosion and that Anzel was turned into a decanter. She reveals that she sold the spell to Ruggedo as she tells Petra to transform Anzel back and retreive a magic amulet. Since the spell only works if the person is willing to be human again, Petra needs to use a special potion that she gets from Scraps after getting a tip from Jack. She gets the potion and turns Anzel back to human, but he tries to run away from her. Suddenly, Cutter appears and snatches him on a Gump Taxi, so Petra gets another Gump to chase them. Cutter reveals that he is actually a covert Phanfasm spy who was born with a human head as he explains that humans are a type of animal. Petra uses candy to make her Gump go faster to catch up with them and Anzel throws her the Spirit Rod but she falls out of the Gump towards the street down below. Thankfully, General Jinjur and Tik-Tok happen to be disccussing military matters as Jinjur uses magic to stop Petra's fall and arrests her for using magic. When brought to court before Ozma, Petra is deemed guility even through she requested a lawyer to defend her, but this turned out to be the Lion. Tik-Tok puts her into a cell and explains that she sentanced to about ten years for committing two felonies of using illegal magic that amount to five years imprisonment each.

  <p key="9f0c9e1a-1ab4-40da-879d-506a3efb7152">
   Meanwhile, Cutter takes Anzel as a prisoner to the Phanfasm castle. In Petra's cell, she is visitied by the Scarecrow who uses psychology to understand Petra's behavior. He asserts that ever since her brother William went missing, she has been driven to help other people and simply collects that infomation as he discretely leaves an escape spell called Escapum. Using it, she falls into a portal hole that leads to outside of the cell, but Tik-Tok is guarding the enterance. After requesting slop called "one bowl of nournishment" from Tik-Tok, she throws it at the wall. In being able to retrieve her things from the evidence box and understanding prision guidelines about hazard conditions, she uses green potion that she got from Scraps to turn the slop green to trick Tik-Tok as she escapes. Upstairs finds that she can't walk out of the enterance because she might wake up a sleeping Jinjur, so she takes the risk of going to the throne room that she finds empty. She calls Toto who takes her to Dee in order to escape the palace. Since Petra got herself in trouble, Dee is upset with her and unwilling to help even with the suggestion that she could use the magic belt to get out. In a fit of anger, Dee wishes for Petra to be quiet and this makes her mute. This ironically also makes it so she doesn't make a sound at all, so she easily walks past the sleeping Jinjur. As she gets to the Hall, suddenly Ozma and Scarecrow appear, so she hides behind a curtain. They are discussing the covert spying operation by Cutter and Ozma confirms that the Spirit Rod was the same item used in the war. Therefore, the souls of the witches are trapped inside. Scarecrow mentions Petra as the woman who found it and Ozma decides to use the Magic Picture to check on her as he would appear to betray her. Ozma restores her voice and brings her into the throne room to explain how balance works in Oz. During the war, she tells that because Dorothy killed the Wicked Witches of the East and West, the Phanfasms were able to attack an unbalanced Oz. They were only able to win after the Good Witches Glinda and Locasta died in the war as balanced was restored. Ozma explains that she only banned magic so no other witch could come to power and threaten the balace that requires a Wicked Witch for every Good Witch. Scarecrow that Cutter has looking for ancient Keystones created by Lurline to protect Oz and thus is the source of all magic but instead he found the Spirit Rod. It is revealed that all four spirits of the dead witches are trapped inside and by using the Keystones, they can be released and thus rescurrected to protect Oz once again. Ozma tells her that they already have found two of these but they need Petra's help to find the other two.

She asks Woot about the Tower and he reveals that he gave Mombi the key to it but she will only give it to her if defeated in the ring. Woot says he will only allow Petra to fight if she gets a coach, so she enlists the Wizard to train her. He has her practice fighting Ugu and his first spell locks her into a box but she uses the escape spell. That alone proves herself to the Wizard so he teaches her the spell of Sap that can absorb magical energy. After this, Petra has Woot set up the fight between her and Mombi. The battle begins with Mombi using a shield, so Petra uses Sap, Mombi then casts a wind spell but Petra easily regains her footing by eating the heavy cake and weakens the shield again with Sap.
