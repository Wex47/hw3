   It is clear that Baum favored book publication of the collection. When his health declined in 1918, Baum worked ahead to prepare books for future publication in the event of his death. He readied three manuscripts, so that his publisher

   The brief Prologue sets up the stories that follow. A narrator tells fairy tales to a friendly gray squirrel, who chatters back amiably; it feels like a conversation, though the human cannot understand the animal. What ensues is the narrator's ideas of the animal fairy tales that the squirrel told him.

   and as episodes in his novels. Baum's animal tales are composed in his own highly imaginative vein, colored with his interest in Theosophy, and different from the more naturalistic stories of Baum contemporaries like Albert Bigelow Paine. Baum's stories are distinguished by the presence of tiger fairies, dog fairies, and similar creatures.

   Baum never gives a detailed or specific description of any of the animal
   fairies
   in his stories. It seems natural to assume that animal fairies share the forms their particular animals; gopher fairies have the forms of gophers, etc. This is the way Dick Martin pictures them in his cover illustration for the book, as winged and flying quadrupeds. In the final story of the sequence, Baum describes the porcupine fairy
   Athlos
   as so "radiant and beautiful" that the sight of her fills Bayal with awe and wonder. Apparently, she is a beautiful and radiant porcupine.
