   , dating from 1912. Baum was enthusiastic about this book for the adult audience, and wanted to published it under his own name, rather than pseudonymously or anonymously like his prior adult novels. Publishers
   Reilly &amp; Britton
   , however, were less positive about the project, as the surviving correspondence reveals. In a letter dated 19 September 1912, the publisher
   Sumner Britton
   informed the author that
   <i key="ab43803b-5101-4f39-a6fc-dd8c30097722">
    Cosmopolitan
   </i>
   magazine had rejected syndication of the book. Baum asked about the book again on 15 October, but

   then drops from the extant correspondence.

   In retrospect, Reilly &amp; Britton sometimes seem to have been amazingly casual about Baum's work. Several Baum novels from this period have not survived —
