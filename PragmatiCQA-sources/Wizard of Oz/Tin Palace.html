   The Tin Woodman's palace is an enormous establishment entirely made of all polished tin that glistens in the rays of the sun like silver. Even the towers, domes and gables are constructed out of tin. Around the grounds of the tin castle runs a high tin wall with tin gates which are always open.

  <p key="83e5208c-8345-4260-a6de-6da1d143db7b">
   The grounds contain pretty tin flower beds, tin fountains and life-size tin statues of all the Emperor's personal and dearest friends such as

   and many more. The paths are paved with sheets of tin and, though most of the flowers are real, there is a singular bed where tin camelias, tin marigolds, tin carnations, tin poppies, and tin hollyhocks are placed in the flower beds as well.

   Inside, all the furniture and decorations are made of brightly polished tin right down to the tables, chairs, beds and even all the ceilings, floors and walls. There are tin pictures hung up on the walls and from the tin ceilings hang handsome tin chandeliers. Many servants spend hours each and every day polishing the grounds to prevent the palace from rusting.

   , the Winkies then asked the Tin Woodman to take her place, and which he happily accepted. Since the home of the Wicked Witch was too old and damp, the Winkies built him a new castle to live in that they proudly built entirely of shiny tin.
