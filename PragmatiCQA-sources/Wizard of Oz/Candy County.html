When Dorothy and Toto arrived at Candy County, they viewed the wonders of Candy County until Toto overlooked the sign that says "Do Not Pick the Lollipos." Dorothy and Toto ended up busted by a candy apple that works as the Royal Sheriff and were brought before the Great Royal Marshmallow. The Great Royal Marshmallow wasn't pleased with what the Royal Sheriff told him. Dorothy learned that the Great Royal Marshmallow had a stomachache and Dorothy convinced the Royal Sheriff to let her help get rid of the Great Royal Marshmallow's stomachache. Dorothy told the Great Royal Marshmallow to stick to eating marshmallows for a while until his stomach felt better. When the Great Royal Marshmallow pardoned Dorothy and Toto of their crime, Dorothy told him that she came to the Land of Oz when
