   Even during his boyhood, Quelala was handsome, masculine, and wise beyond his years. Hence, he attracted the attention of Princess Gayelette, who had been longing to find a truly worthy husband. She took him to her ruby palace and, using all her magic powers (for she was also a powerful sorceress), made him
   <i key="d3e9d65d-0a21-4ea2-92ac-ae59c258737a">
    "as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish"
   </i>
   . When he grew to manhood, he became
   <i key="38501832-f25e-444b-bc0c-82a6882a57af">
    "the best and wisest man in all the land"
   </i>
   , and he was so handsome that Gayelette loved him dearly, and quickly began preparations for their wedding.
  </p>
  <p key="71c93a24-ca64-4757-952c-f8dcb76f07ec">
   One day, just before the wedding, the mischievous

   </a>
   (who lived in the forest near Gayelette's palace) played a prank on Quelala - they tossed him into a river, and while he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune, and actually laughed at the prank played on him, his rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet was still ruined. Gayelette was furious, and wanted to drown all the Monkeys as punishment, but upon the King of the Monkeys' desperate pleas and Quelala's speaking for them, she spared them conditionally: thereafter, the Monkeys had to be the slaves to the

   </a>
   she had prepared as a wedding present for Quelala, and whoever that owner may be, and whatever said owner's bidding may be, they - the Monkeys - were bound to obey them three times unless that particular bidding was well and truly beyond their capabilities.
  </p>
  <p key="ae3fe333-fd81-4411-977d-7b537b36f761">
   Aware of how Gayelette still could not bear the sight of the Monkeys, as well as how the Monkeys were also deathly afraid of her, Quelala - as the first original owner of the cap - summoned them to meet him in the forest after the wedding, and ordered them all to always keep out of her sight, which they were happy to do. After that, nothing more was known of him, but it can be assumed that he and his wife lived happily ever after.

Though it was never specifically stated or confirmed, given Gayelette's nature and the potency of her magic, it was still highly likely that Quelala's manly beauty was also constant, eternal, and never faded with time, just like hers.
