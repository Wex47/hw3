   Princess Langwidere sleeps in a huge bed constructed out of the purest crystal and that is surrounded by her hearts desires. The only company Langwidere allows herself to have is usually just from her maids and ladies in waiting. Langwidere does not like to socialize with commoners or even other royalty or people of noble blood. She rarely interacts with others too much, and prefers to simply seclude herself to keep from being interrupted or distracted from her daily rituals of pampering or catching her beauty sleep when having one of her many daily naps. Langwidere lives a life of luxury and privilege, she wants little to do with the outside world and isn't bothered by her reclusive, bizarre reputation.
  </p>
  <p key="13800ce9-6fc6-4e11-84e5-e624fcf18e06">
   In her life of nearly complete isolation, Langwidere entertains herself, as she has thirty young heads that are interchangeable on her neck. All are described to be very striking and all are very beautiful, having attractive features, nice eyes, rich hair and flawless skin.
  </p>
  <p key="aabc9942-8b43-470a-85ad-a88f91ad29b7">
   Instead of changing her outfits or jewelry every day like most ladies of privilege enjoy doing, such as wearing different crowns and gowns, she simply changes her head to accessorize or match her current state of mood, rather it be a good mood she is in or a bad one. The heads are said to all be safely kept in a vast and delicate bejeweled boudoir known as her "cabinet" in her sleeping chambers. These precious heads vary through all combinations of hair texture, eye colors (except for gray hair and red, tired eyes), skin tones, and even noses and lips of different ethnicities. And the heads of this collection can never age or become worn out as they are all preserved to keep young forever.
  </p>
  <p key="e03e3c7e-f12d-4ff1-b14f-53055be924f9">
   Langwidere herself, is very vain, conceited, selfish and ultimately lazy as she generally spends every waking moment of her life indoors admiring whichever head she's currently wearing in her large mirrored chambers and napping in the day for hours at a time. She highly enjoys constantly changing heads whenever she pleases and adopts a new look when she is tiresome of sitting on her vanity-chair admiring her reflections or simply bored with playing music on her Mandolin.
  </p>
  <p key="ea2daf2c-3273-42b5-9db4-6f9fe83e852e">
   Since she can change her face at will, she has no interest in fashion or beautiful clothing. She always wears a simple white silk gown that falls gracefully to the floor like a wedding dress. Langwidere is said to wear only white because the color white suits any of her heads and goes with anything. Because her appearance changes so frequently, even Langwidere's loyal maid
   Nanda
   can only recognize her by a ruby-red key, which she wears on a chain attached to her left wrist, and which opens up all of her bejeweled cabinets.

   . She spent a lot of money from the Royal-Treasury and the family fortune, vainly on herself. She also only spent ten minutes of every day actually governing and tending to matters of state which was not enough. But much so as she did not care about the people of her land. Furthermore, she admitted that she would rather spend those ten minutes admiring her beauty in a mirror.

Langwidere curtly told Dorothy that she was boring and stupid, and dismissed her. Then, after closely inspecting Dorothy's face, she changed her mind and said that Dorothy should stay so that Langwidere could take her head and add it to her collection, offering Dorothy one of her less attractive heads, No. 26, in exchange. Dorothy was indignant at this and refused; she was then imprisoned by the Princess's guards until she would consent to Langwidere's demands.

At first, Langwidere was furious that Ozma and her assembly had stormed her palace, but when the Oz party explained the nature of their mission, Langwidere completely calmed down and said she supported them because if the Royal Family was restored to rule the kingdom, she could finally devote all her time toward admiring herself in the mirror. Langwidere then freed Dorothy, provided room and board for Ozma's group, and told them where to find the
