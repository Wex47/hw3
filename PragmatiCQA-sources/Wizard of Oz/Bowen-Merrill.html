   George M. Hill Co.

   Bowen-Merrill, which had been in business since 1850 under various names, changed its name to Bobbs-Merrill in 1903 when new partner W. C. Bobbs joined the firm.

   Baum, however, was not happy with his treatment by the company or the royalties they paid. When
   Frank Reilly
   and
   Sumner Britton
   formed
   Reilly &amp; Britton
   in 1904, Baum signed a contract with the new firm and stayed with them for the remainder of his career.

   Baum lost the royalties from his Bobbs-Merrill books in his
   bankruptcy
   in 1911; the rights were transferred to the control of the trustee of his estate,
   Harrison Rountree
   , in order to satisfy creditors. Baum's widow
   Maud Gage Baum
   did not retrieve the rights to
