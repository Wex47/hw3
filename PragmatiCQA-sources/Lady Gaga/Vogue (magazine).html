     Go Gaga
     A self-styled "good Catholic girl" and "New York avant-garde fashion monster", Lady Gaga has stormed the charts and thrilled the tabloids. Hadley Freeman hangs out with pop's newest disco sensation, and talks fame, style - and Babybel cheese. Photographed by Josh Olins.
     It is a summery Sunday night, and Lady Gaga, Dada (her ex-boyfriend and now her creative director, aka Matthew Williams), assorted entourage members and I are speeding across London to meet Madonna and see her perform. Gaga has just come off stage after supporting Take That at Wembley, and, after her fantastic, if also fantastically OTT, set at Glastonbury the week before ‚Äî during which she appeared to shoot fire out of her breasts ‚Äî it is hard to imagine anyone less likely to appeal to the mainstream Take That crowd than Gaga. ‚ÄúIt was, like, all 35- to 40-year-old women, and I‚Äôm there, like, grabbing my vagina and they‚Äôre all, like, what?‚Äù she says. This is the sixth time she has said ‚Äúvagina‚Äù, or a word for it, in 12 hours, which is fewer than I‚Äôd expected, but more perhaps than her PR would have liked.
     But the future is looking good. Aside from the upcoming meeting with Madonna, and aside from Gaga‚Äôs recent successes (including ‚ÄúPoker Face‚Äù, which spent three weeks at number one in the UK single charts), Dada has just told Gaga that Karl Lagerfeld has asked to meet her. ‚ÄúOh my God, Karl Lagerfeld! You‚Äôre serious?‚Äù she squeals, her husky New York monotone rising by several octaves. As chance would have it, Gaga is sporting a Chanel jacket, paired with fishnet tights, a leotard and Chanel ankle boots. (‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very lady look,‚Äù she claims.) She leans back in her seat. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I have three hours free now,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúWell, there are a lot of phone interviews I could ask you to do,‚Äù her PR interjects, only semi-joking. She mock scowls from beneath her heavy blonde fringe. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare,‚Äù she says, then, as if remembering who she is, quickly corrects herself: ‚Äú0f course I‚Äôll do them.‚Äù She leans sleepily against Dada‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything you want,‚Äù she trails off. It has been a long day.
     Twelve hours earlier: ‚ÄúOh my Gaaahhhd, that is so sick, that is fucked up, that is high fashion,‚Äù Gaga decrees when looking at herself in the mirror wearing some lacy Mickey Mouse-style ears by Maison Michel. (This is an expression of the highest approval.) It is about 10 am and she has had three hours‚Äô sleep, ‚Äúat most‚Äù, after a late-night gig at GAY. Predictably, though, she has more fizz and vim than anyone else at the Vogue shoot. She never walks, only scurries. ‚ÄúI looooove that,‚Äù she cries, dashing to another rail and pulling out a hot-pink tulle skirt, but then pauses. ‚ÄúWait, I wore hot pink in my last [David] LaChapelle shoot, so we should probably do something different. Oh my God, that jacket is sick!‚Äù
     At this point, Gaga is wearing the outfit she rolled out of bed into ‚Äî a one-shoulder leotard, ribbed tights, Chanel boots and a pink and grey poncho-like garment, which may, or may not, be by Giles. ‚ÄúYoo-hoo, where do you come from?‚Äù she halloos to the poncho, after I ask its provenance, and she whips it right off to find out. The poncho does not have a tag‚Äî nor does it reply. She is also, of course, in full make-up, replete with blonde wig (soon to be replaced by a softer; wavier version by Sam McKnight ‚Äî a look she adopts after the shoot), and lashes so thick they act as mini visors. Gaga describes her look as ‚ÄúNew York avant-garde fashion monster‚Äù, and, when asked who her style icons are, she replies in a snap, ‚ÄúGrace Jones and Jesus ‚Äî I love loincloths.‚Äù She pauses for breath, then announces, to no one in particular, ‚ÄúI want some Babybel cheese!‚Äù
     In a music year dominated by strong female debuts, Lady Gaga‚Äôs has been the most successful, by some distance. Her debut self-penned album, The Fame, bas sold more than 2.3 million copies and it kicked Ronan Keating off the number one spot in the UK album
     charts ‚Äî which is reason enough to love her. She has already been profiled in the New Yorker magazine, which credited her with bringing disco back after the long dominance of R‚Äôn‚ÄôB. The Haus of Gaga ‚Äî a collective comprising the singer and her artistic friends
     ‚Äî has been, somewhat dubiously, compared to Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factor while Gaga bas been compared to Madonna. And the way she has used, shah we say, an eccentric fashion style to carve out an identity has put her in the aesthetic tradition of Gwen Stefani, Bj√∂rk and, yes, Grace Jones. Gaga, however, describes herself as ‚Äújust a good little Catholic girl‚Äù, and then looks down at her feet, shod in Louboutin ankle boots. ‚ÄúI could really fuck these shoes.‚Äù
     Joanne Stefani Germanotta, as she was until four years ago, was born in New York in 1986. Although she makes repeated references to her current life in Manhattan‚Äôs Lower East Side, she attended the Catholic girls‚Äô school Convent of the Sacred Heart, which was also the alma mater of the Hilton sisters. Gaga was a talented musician and a smart student. ‚ÄúI dressed in this super-sexualised way ‚Äî miniskirts, hooker boots. But because I got straight As, the teachers couldn‚Äôt do anything,‚Äù she smirks.
     After a year at Tisch School of the Arts, she dropped out to write music and work as a go-go dancer. Her parents, she admits, were not thrilled. She also changed her name to Lady Gaga, in homage to Queen‚Äôs ‚ÄúRadio Ga Ga‚Äù. It may be opportune to mention at this point that she was taking ‚Äúa lot‚Äù of drugs (‚Äúmainly cocaine, some other stuff‚Äîyeah, it was pretty bad‚Äù), before quitting for ‚Äúmy health and my father‚Äù. By now, she was signed as a songwriter to Interscope Records and writing songs for the Pussycat Dolls and Britney Spears, until her own performing potential was spotted. The Fame, her catchy disco paeon to the world of celebrity, came out last year.
     Gaga causes a bit of a fuss whenever she comes to London. Last Januar3 the tabloids were delighted when she was photographed making a late-night visit to a fish-and-chip shop wearing a green leotard. In April, she cowed Jonathan Ross with her unflappable self-confidence and willingness to explain the meaning of her lyric, ‚Äúbluffin‚Äô with my muffin‚Äù, when she appeared on bis talk show. ‚ÄúI suddenly feel really old,‚Äù bleated Ross.
     ‚ÄúGaga has been relentless in selling herself,‚Äù says music critic Alexis Petridis. ‚ÄúIf you walk around London in the middle of winter in your panties, it‚Äôs indicative of a certain insane drive, which seems to be on a different level to anyone else‚Äôs. But it‚Äôs not going to work if the songs aren‚Äôt there, and she writes really strong pop songs with big, hook-y choruses.‚Äù
     She also has a 23-year-old‚Äôs tendency towards self-contradiction. Despite her often mentioned pride in her education, whenever someone says a vaguely sophisticated word, such as, say, ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù, she and Dada collapse into giggles. ‚ÄúTrajectory!‚Äù she hoots. When asked about the comparisons between the Haus of Gaga and Warhol‚Äôs Factory, she flinches in irritation: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt around then, so I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just trying to be a real artist, and have real experiences, so I can tell real stories. ‚ÄúYet she invites such comparisons, not least via the short film she shows before her Wembley gig called Who Shot C‚Äô1andy Warhol?, in which she stars as Warhol.
     She is also an extremely good model, one who knows how to create a strong image, which comes from a real awareness of how she looks, coupled with a genuine love of fashion. Her features are of the oversized variety that photographs well, and her body is soft and small. Despite her lack of sleep, her big eyes are bright. ‚ÄúOh, hello, old friend!‚Äù she coos, stepping into an Alexander McQueen gown. On the shoot, she poses with the practised art of someone who has gazed at fashion magazines for years. Nicola Formichetti, fashion director of Vogue Hommes Japan, often works with Gaga, and says, "Gaga is not like any other celebrity I've worked with," says Nicola Formichetti of Vogue Hommes Japans. "She would die for fashion."
     "At school I dressed in this super-sexualised way - miniskirts, hooker boots," says Gaga. "But because I got straight A‚Äôs, the teachers couldn't do anything."

      ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not An Imitation, It‚Äôs A Becoming‚Äù: Lady Gaga On The ‚ÄúDelicious Madness‚Äù Of Inhabiting Lady Gucci
     </b>
     In a windowless studio in Chelsea, Manhattan, the pink marabou trim on an ankle boot is fluttering expectantly in the breeze from an electric fan. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs 10 minutes out,‚Äù says a handsome security person, popping his head around the door, as a phalanx of assistants move silently about a fabulous, temporary, shimmering grotto of couture.
     Freshly delivered from the shows in Paris and Venice, there are rails of Valentino silks in electric amethyst and fuchsia, inky black Schiaparelli velvet bracketed by gleaming gold, serious Chanel brocade, polar-white Louis Vuitton knits, headpieces fashioned from metal, leather and feathers, a hundred pairs of heels in every height, and table upon table of rainbow scarves, gloves and jewels. I even spot some Elizabethan-style ruffs. We are here for Lady Gaga‚Äôs Vogue fitting, of course. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs start her in something fabulous,‚Äù says Edward Enninful, British Vogue‚Äôs editor-in-chief, as if there were any other option.
     Naturally, 10 minutes comes and goes, but eventually, at an indeterminate point in superstar time, the door finally opens and through it emerges a 5ft 2in figure dressed in a long black summer-knit dress and impossibly high black leather platforms. It is a curious experience to encounter a pop culture legend giving you her most quintessential vibe, and Gaga has not disappointed. Already photographs taken moments ago of her short walk from her car into the building in 9in heels are pinging around the world. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make magic!‚Äù she says by way of hello.
     With countless fashion moments, 12 Grammys, an Oscar and perhaps the most explosive rise to fame of the 21st century to her name, Stefani Germanotta has ‚Äì for well over a decade now ‚Äì been among the best-known people on the planet. And boy does she know how to play up to it. Having removed her sunglasses, she throws her tanned, tattooed arms around us in a series of warm hugs, then is on to the job in hand. ‚ÄúWhatever I wear,‚Äù she says to the assembled group, in that trademark up-all-night drawl, earnestness dusted with levity, ‚ÄúI will be serving painful Italian glamour from within.‚Äù
     Of course. This month, the 35-year-old pop queen turned Oscar-nominated actor is set to appear in only her second-ever movie lead, in House of Gucci, director Ridley Scott‚Äôs 20-years-in-the-planning retelling of one of the late 20th century‚Äôs most notorious crime cases. To say expectations are high does not do things justice. Gaga ‚Äì as anyone who has been on the internet in the past six months knows ‚Äì will play Patrizia Reggiani, ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci and a socialite who, in 1998, was convicted of engaging the hitman who shot him dead as he entered his offices in Milan one morning in the spring of 1995.
     The case featured so much money and original sin that it rocked Italy and the world, and sent shock waves through the fashion industry. Safe to say, the film‚Äôs trailer, which Gaga pulls up on her laptop to show us (it‚Äôs a few days before it‚Äôs released to the world, where it will go on to be viewed in excess of 10 million times), sets the tone. ‚ÄúFather, Son and House of Gucci,‚Äù intones Gaga as Reggiani, conker-coloured hair teased to the max, cigarette in hand, as she gestures the sign of the crucifix across a dress of large pink polka dots. She watches herself on the little screen, enjoying the coos of wonder from the assembled team. ‚ÄúI look super-different,‚Äù she says, intrigued by her own image.
     A few weeks later, I video-call her at home on the West Coast. Never one to miss an opportunity to work her own myth, she pops up on my screen mid-song. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve caught me singing!‚Äù she says, after she‚Äôs completed a couple more bars of Cole Porter‚Äôs ‚ÄúNight and Day‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard not to love the commitment of a showgirl ‚Äì especially one who is seated in her pretty pink office, complete with piano and glamour station, and a floor-to-ceiling wall of stilettos behind her. ‚ÄúWell, you know, I have to put something on the walls,‚Äù she says, drily.
     She‚Äôs wearing ‚Äúa dusty rose T-shirt‚Äù she shrugs, from where precisely she cannot be sure, with black leggings. ‚ÄúThis is a necklace from my boyfriend, from a beautiful artisanal shop in San Francisco, as well as these earrings,‚Äù she says. Her mother, Cynthia, is coming for tea later, and she‚Äôs in a mellow mid-afternoon mood. She‚Äôs pulled two long strands of honey-brunette hair from her bun, and they‚Äôre hanging over her exquisitely made-up face, the whole experience adding up to a sort of heightened drama-student effect. The artist in repose, if you will.
     It makes sense. ‚ÄúIt is three years since I started working on it,‚Äù she launches in on House of Gucci, ‚Äúand I will be fully honest and transparent: I lived as her [Reggiani] for a year and a half. And I spoke with an accent for nine months of that.‚Äù Off camera, too? ‚ÄúOff camera,‚Äù she confirms, solemnly. ‚ÄúI never broke. I stayed with her.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúIt was nearly impossible for me to speak in the accent as a blonde,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúI instantly had to dye my hair, and I started to live in a way whereby anything that I looked at, anything that I touched, I started to take notice of where and when I could see money. I started to take photographs as well. I have no evidence that Patrizia was a photographer, but I thought as an exercise, and finding her interests in life, that I would become a photographer, so I took my point-and-shoot camera everywhere that I went. I noticed that Patrizia loved beautiful things. If something wasn‚Äôt beautiful, I deleted it.‚Äù
     Gaga says that had life not gone the way of meat dresses and stadium tours, she might have liked to be a reporter, and it was an artist-cum-journalist‚Äôs approach that she took to piecing together Reggiani for herself. (Reggiani, it should be noted, is still very much alive, residing in Milan and perfectly capable of talking to the press herself. She is reportedly pleased such a marquee name is to play her, although ‚Äì self-aggrandisement undimmed by having served 18 years of a 26-year prison sentence for having her ex-husband killed ‚Äì told an Italian journalist earlier this summer, ‚ÄúI am quite annoyed by the fact that Lady Gaga is playing me in the new Ridley Scott film without even having the foresight and sensitivity to come and meet me.‚Äù)
     So you haven‚Äôt even met her? I ask Gaga. ‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù she replies, ‚ÄúI only felt that I could truly do this story justice if I approached it with the eye of a curious woman who was interested in possessing a journalistic spirit so that I could read between the lines of what was happening in the film‚Äôs scenes.‚Äù She seems keen to ensure she is being crystal clear. ‚ÄúMeaning that nobody was going to tell me who Patrizia Gucci was,‚Äù she says, flatly. ‚ÄúNot even Patrizia Gucci.‚Äù
     Unusually this late in the game, the film itself remains blanketed in secrecy. When we meet, Ridley Scott has not even permitted Gaga to see a cut. She says she ‚Äútrusts‚Äù him fully and out of ‚Äúrespect‚Äù doesn‚Äôt want to give away too much of its scope. Nevertheless, after some wheedling, I manage to ascertain that Gucci will likely pick up at the dawn of the 1970s, when Patrizia (who grew up poor in Vignola, Northern Italy, but whose fortunes changed thanks to a new stepfather‚Äôs money, made in the trucking industry), first met Maurizio Gucci on the Milanese party scene. Spurred on by her mother, Silvana Barbieri, Reggiani was on the make, and Maurizio had it all: fortune, looks, name. (‚ÄúHe fell madly in love with me,‚Äù Reggiani has said. ‚ÄúI was exciting and different.‚Äù)
     No one doubts it was a wild romance. ‚ÄúShe loved him too,‚Äù says Gaga. Although Maurizio‚Äôs father, Rodolfo ‚Äì son of company founder Guccio Gucci ‚Äì had plenty of misgivings about Reggiani‚Äôs rackety upbringing, the pair wed in 1972. (The bride wore Gucci, naturally, a high-necked, long-sleeved concoction that, from squinting at paparazzi shots from the new film‚Äôs set, seems to have been updated to something a little racier for Lady Gaga.)
     During the 1970s and early ‚Äô80s, the young Guccis were it; gorgeous, charismatic newlyweds adrift on a sea of luxury. Two beautiful daughters, a famous yacht (the Creole) and a permanent spot on the guest list at Studio 54, this was life lived at the knife-edge of glamour. On top of the penthouse in New York‚Äôs Olympic Tower, the villa in Acapulco, the chalet in Saint Moritz and the farm in Connecticut, there was Patrizia‚Äôs ¬£8,000 a month orchid habit, her friendship with Jackie Kennedy, her multimillion-pound jewellery collection, parties, palazzos and private number plates for the cars, emblazoned with the legend mauizia (in portmanteau terms at least, the couple was years ahead of Brangelina).
     But, in 1983, the fantasy faltered. After the death of Rodolfo, Maurizio, his only child, took full control of his 50 per cent stake in the company (the remainder was owned by Rodolfo‚Äôs brother Aldo), and the family wars began in earnest. Reggiani, now fancying herself more Gucci than Gucci, was at loggerheads with her husband as often as she was with the cousins, and as the decade wore on the marriage fell apart ‚Äì he walked out on her in 1985. She did not take this well: when Maurizio would no longer take her calls, she would record tapes of herself furiously railing at him and courier them over to his apartment on the Corso Venezia.
     Life was no rosier at work. This was the era of Gucci‚Äôs famed, flawed licensing model, whereby everything from golf clubs to tea towels was farmed out to third-party manufacturers in a cash grab. Maurizio was determined to regain control, to reinstate the peerless quality of leather goods that the family had built its original fortune on, and sought new investment. But amid the tussles with Aldo (who ended up in prison for tax fraud) and cousins, the lustre of the once great house dimmed to a dangerous low.
     Noted ambition aside, Maurizio‚Äôs plans were his undoing. He was unable to bring in enough cash to cover his lavish spending, and in 1993 he sold his entire share to Investcorp for $120 million ‚Äì effectively ending more than 70 years of Gucci family ownership of their namesake brand. Patrizia, who had remained front and centre throughout the dramas, as well as legally his wife, lit up with what she herself has termed ‚Äúrage‚Äù. It did not help matters that, three years earlier, he had begun a relationship with one-time model and later interior designer Paola Franchi, a friend from childhood who had attended his wedding to Patrizia. As divorce finally loomed, her husband, name, wealth and status ‚Äì her very identity ‚Äì were all slipping away. The situation was a tinderbox.
     Gaga was riveted: ‚ÄúI became fascinated with the journey of this woman.‚Äù She spent more than a year poring over newspaper clippings and recordings of Reggiani, although, tellingly, she did not read Sara Gay Forden‚Äôs The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed, the 2000 book on which the film is based. ‚ÄúI did not want anything that had an opinion that would colour my thinking in any way.‚Äù Scott originally sent her the script shortly after A Star Is Born, her triumphant arrival as a Hollywood lead, was released, in 2018. Along with his wife and producing partner, Giannina Facio, he had taken a long safari with the project, been in and out as director himself, with Angelina Jolie, Pen√©lope Cruz and Margot Robbie variously attached to play Reggiani along the way. But the stars aligned for Gaga: ‚ÄúWhat if I didn‚Äôt play some edgy, sexy, chancy, risky bitch?‚Äù she recalls thinking. ‚ÄúSome punky Italian gold digger?‚Äù
     When Gucci‚Äôs producers settled on a somewhat retro-seeming plan to have the cast deliver their dialogue in English with thick Italian accents, Gaga knew nailing Reggiani‚Äôs voice would be key. She worked tirelessly at it. ‚ÄúI started with a specific dialect from Vignola, then I started to work in the higher class way of speaking that would have been more appropriate in places like Milan and Florence,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúIn the movie, you‚Äôll hear that my accent is a little different depending on who I‚Äôm speaking to.‚Äù The trailer has raised a few eyebrows in Italy, the worry being this may be another bunch of American actors talking a-like-a-this. Gaga, one of her nation‚Äôs best-known Italian-American citizens, is sensitive to the subject. ‚ÄúIt was the experience of a lifetime making this film because every minute of every day I thought of my ancestors in Italy, and what they had to do so that I could have a better life. I just wanted to make them proud, which is why I made the decision to make the performance about a real woman and not about the idea of a bad woman.‚Äù
     So she entered the mind of a murderer. The Guccis finally divorced in 1994, and as Maurizio made plans to wed Franchi, which would see Reggiani‚Äôs alimony halved to what she called ‚Äúa bowl of lentils‚Äù ($860,000 a year), her taped rants became increasingly unhinged and threatening. In one, later played in court, she railed at him, ‚ÄúThe inferno for you is yet to come.‚Äù Soon she sought the counsel of her best friend Pina Auriemma, a Neapolitan clairvoyant, who in turn hired hitman Benedetto Ceraulo, a pizzeria owner with money troubles. At 8.30 on a clear morning in late March 1995, Ceraulo carried out Reggiani‚Äôs instruction to murder the father of her children. He was 46. Reggiani was sentenced three years later and released on parole in 2016. Her daughters, Alessandra and Allegra Gucci, originally supported their mother, believing her behaviour was due to a benign brain tumour she‚Äôd had removed. But after many years, they reportedly no longer speak.
     I mean, it‚Äôs a lot to take on, isn‚Äôt it, Gaga, I say. All this glitz, all this sadness. Were you not nervous about getting involved? As ever, she had to find the mission within. A purpose. ‚ÄúI wish not to glorify somebody that would commit murder,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I do wish to pay respect to women throughout history who became experts at survival, and to the unfortunate consequences of hurt. I hope that women will watch this and remind themselves to think twice about the fact that hurt people hurt people. And it‚Äôs dangerous. What happens to somebody,‚Äù she asks, ‚Äúwhen they‚Äôre pushed over the edge?‚Äù
     It sounds like the shoot had the potential to answer that last question. Principal photography began in February this year in Rome, with the Gucci men played by a cast that includes Adam Driver as Maurizio, Jeremy Irons as Rodolfo, Al Pacino as uncle Aldo and Jared Leto as cousin Paolo. With Italy beset by lockdowns, and with paparazzi everywhere, Gaga, in thrall to the Susan Batson technique (her acting teacher, who was on set, was herself taught by Lee Strasberg), says she had gone so deep with the part she began to lose touch with reality. ‚ÄúI had some psychological difficulty at one point towards the end of filming,‚Äù she explains, taking care with her words. ‚ÄúI was either in my hotel room, living and speaking as Reggiani, or I was on set, living and speaking as her. I remember I went out into Italy one day with a hat on to take a walk. I hadn‚Äôt taken a walk in about two months and I panicked.‚Äù She could no longer compute the real world. ‚ÄúI thought I was on a movie set.‚Äù
     ‚ÄúDelicious madness,‚Äù is how Salma Hayek ‚Äì who plays Pina Auriemma ‚Äì describes Gaga‚Äôs work process to me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very glamorous,‚Äù she says of the movie, ‚Äúvery glitzy, and very few times I have seen that level of passion with an actor,‚Äù she says, impressed. ‚ÄúShe really committed.‚Äù Was it at all tricky to work with? ‚ÄúIt was not a nightmare!‚Äù she tuts, laughing. ‚ÄúIt was a fascinating thing. She was magical. A genius.‚Äù
     Gaga is more self-effacing. ‚ÄúWe were in between takes and Salma was like, ‚ÄòOh, this f**king method actor is over here. You know, she‚Äôs not talking to me right now.‚Äô Because I was doing sense memory work next to her, and she was making fun of me while I was sitting there doing it. And I didn‚Äôt even laugh. When the scene was over, I flipped at her and I said, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre ridiculous!‚Äô and I started laughing and I kissed her. It was a wonderful set, but I‚Äôm very serious when I work.‚Äù
     She‚Äôs really chuckling at the memory. Not to be a buzzkill, I say, but surely it must be hard on your family to lose you like this for so long? To watch their daughter, sister, girlfriend morph info a murderous Milanese socialite for months on end? She nods slowly. ‚ÄúThere was some silence and some disconnect for a while,‚Äù she tells me.
     She says she dropped the accent straight after filming wrapped, but other parts lingered. ‚ÄúYou end up sounding and looking like them, yes, but it‚Äôs not an imitation, it‚Äôs a becoming. I remember when we started filming, I knew I had become ‚Äì and I knew that the greater challenge was going to be unbecoming.‚Äù She feels the weight of it keenly. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my own journey as an artist that I still reckon with, Giles. And I ask myself, ‚ÄòIs this healthy, the way that you do this?‚Äô‚Äù She shrugs; resigned, self-aware, perhaps a little proud. ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt know any other way.‚Äù
     She settles into a reflective mood. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm 35 now,‚Äù she says, laughing. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre like, ‚ÄòLady Gaga is 35! I feel old!‚Äô‚Äù Never too old for a fabulous press tour. For sheer Hollywood pizzazz, her A Star Is Born appearances were probably the best red carpet run of the past few years (all that periwinkle silk faille), and she‚Äôs ready to go again. ‚ÄúI love seeing everyone,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI appreciate so much how the public has adored me for almost two decades now. Whether I‚Äôm singing, acting or walking a red carpet, I love making the public smile.‚Äù
     Certainly, she has retained her heady combination of sincerity and camp: ‚ÄúAlthough age is just a number, what I feel mostly is a lot of love for the artistic community, and the artistic collective,‚Äù she says, telling me I must deliver this message from her ‚Äúto the world‚Äù. In January, she sang at Joe Biden‚Äôs inauguration. ‚ÄúThat has to be one of the proudest days of my whole life. Like many people in America, I felt a deep fear when Trump was president, and ushering 45 out and 46 in is something I‚Äôll be able to tell my children all about.‚Äù She smiles. ‚ÄúSinging in a Schiaparelli bulletproof dress. I don‚Äôt know if people know this about me, but if I weren‚Äôt who I am today, I would have been a combat journalist. That was one of my dreams. When I was at the Capitol, the day before the inauguration, I remember walking around and looking for evidence of the insurrection.‚Äù
     Happiness, so often a stranger to her, has returned. ‚ÄúThere was a long time when I didn‚Äôt think that I could heal from becoming famous at such a young age, and what it did to my brain,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut I feel ready to declare myself whole. We will never all be fully whole,‚Äù she self-corrects, ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs certainly enough. I have a lot of gratitude for joy.‚Äù Is this new? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been pretty recent, yes. I would say over the past two years.‚Äù Gaga ‚Äì a quintessential New Yorker ‚Äì now lives mostly in Hollywood, with her boyfriend Michael Polansky, a Harvard-educated executive director of the philanthropic Parker Foundation, where his work focuses on science, public health and the arts. She dotes on her dogs and says they‚Äôre doing fine now, after they were dognapped and their walker shot (non-fatally) in a shocking series of events earlier this year. ‚ÄúYes, they are OK,‚Äù she says, understandably still rattled. ‚ÄúThank God.‚Äù
     The pop star and film star schedule remains intense. On top of Gucci, in the past year she has performed jazz classics with Tony Bennett at Radio City Music Hall, and released Love for Sale, their second album of Cole Porter duets, to terrific reviews. She oversees her Born This Way Foundation, with its mission to support the mental wellbeing of young people and empower them to build a kinder world, and is absolutely smitten with Haus Laboratories, her vegan make-up line, with its pretty palettes and its much loved liquid eyeliner, that pulls in more than ¬£100 million a year.
     Then, of course, there was Chromatica, her barnstorming electro-fabulous 2020 album. A follow-up of remixes arrived earlier this year ‚Äì Dawn of Chromatica ‚Äì and a post-pandemic tour is on the cards. Naturally, as Chromatica‚Äôs prime demographic, I begin gushing about how much it meant to me in lockdown, and she attempts a smile before saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been in more pain in my life than I was making that record. It‚Äôs very hard for me to listen to. It‚Äôs very hard for me to sing those songs, but it‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre not amazing, wonderful songs. It‚Äôs because they came from a very, very black hole in my heart.‚Äù
     What place were you in when you were recording it? ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be me anymore,‚Äù she says, simply. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have the ability to understand what I was capable of any longer as a person. I didn‚Äôt feel that I was worth just about anything. But I made it anyway. I said this to a friend the other day ‚Äì whenever I go through hard times now, I always say with a laugh, ‚ÄòYeah, this is hard. But it‚Äôs a lot harder when you want to kill yourself every day.‚Äô So I pledge to always be somebody that speaks about mental health, that speaks about kindness, about compassion and validation. I believe wholeheartedly that the universe made this a part of my story so that I could be prepared to talk about it with the world.‚Äù
     For a moment, the performance of fame drops. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not the world,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe whole world doesn‚Äôt know what I do, and that‚Äôs not the point. It‚Äôs whoever‚Äôs listening. Whoever‚Äôs listening: I love you, and if you‚Äôre in pain, I promise you it will get better.‚Äù
     Her mind, though, soon returns to Gucci-world. ‚ÄúThis was something else that I was interested in: who killed Maurizio, meaning who did she hire?‚Äù she says, still fascinated. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my belief that actually, she didn‚Äôt tell the truth about this.‚Äù Gaga would watch interviews on YouTube and say to herself, ‚Äú‚ÄòYou‚Äôre lying.‚Äô In one interview, she said it was some ‚Äòbeagle boys‚Äô, meaning, I think, that it was one of the mafia. I wondered for a moment if it was the Camorra that had done it, which is the sort of mafia in Naples. So I made some, again secret, decisions about what I decided to believe while I was filming.‚Äù
     Do you imagine that there will come a time ‚Äì once the film is out, once you‚Äôre beyond the intensity of all this ‚Äì where you might wish to meet Reggiani, I ask? At the very least, won‚Äôt curiosity get the better of you?
     There follows a significant pause. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not entirely sure. I think it requires a certain emotional quotient to be an actor,‚Äù she says, trying to explain her reticence. It also took her deep into a darkness she is ready to shake off. ‚ÄúThe way I felt playing this character by the end, I realised that when you kill someone else, you really kill yourself.‚Äù
     She goes quiet and seems for a moment to be lost in it all again. Slowly she blinks a few times, bringing herself back to Gaga‚Äôs reality, away from Patrizia‚Äôs. ‚ÄúWho I care the most for in this process are her children,‚Äù she says, carefully, ‚Äúand I extend to them love and compassion that I‚Äôm sure this movie coming out is tremendously difficult or painful for them, potentially. And I wish nothing but peace for their hearts.‚Äù Her eyes are again full of worry. Then hope. ‚ÄúI did my very best to play the truth.‚Äù

    to discuss the shoot wearing a trailing white chiffon Galliano goddess gown with Philip Treacy headdress that spelled VOGUE in clipped white feathers. The following day, she came to see Creative Director Grace Coddington in a little black dress with a flaming-red wig, and later appeared on location, as Coddington recalls, "stark naked except for her rubber raincoat and some very, very high heels!" She then promptly threw herself in the mud at Leibowitz's feet. "gaga was so bubbly and chatty and enthusiastic and excited to be alive," says Coddington. "She was up for anything."

    Gaga acknowledges that her art director, Matthew williams--"my Jean Paul Goude"--was "the inspiration that made the connection for me between the art world and the fashion world. He used to say things like 'If you want to make a shoulder pad, don't research jackets--research sculpture, mineral rocks, paintings.' he thinks in a different way; he is the designer of the future."

   <p key="f9b9df79-a9e9-45d4-ad5b-8ce7325d7aeb">
    Fashion and art collide in Gaga's work, too. "We'd been thinking of innovative ways to premiere the music," she says about her decision to debut "Bad Romance" at Alexander McQueen's Plato's Atlantis show, which she found "not of this world." "When Magdalena was stomping her pretty little hooves down the runway." she says, "it was dreamlike." Meanwhile her ballad "Speechless" ("about my love for my father") was first performed in November in Los Angeles at MOCA's thirtieth-anniversary gala, as part of an installation by Francesco Vezzoli. For this she became, in her words, "a child of the Warhol of my time, among the most famous Pop Artists of our time--Damien Hirst made the piano!"

    Like a proud but concerned mother, Oprah Winfrey is staring intently into Lady Gaga's powdery, pale, if not poker face. With one hand on Gaga's upper arm to steady her, Oprah, gorgeous in a midnight-blue Oscar de la Renta ball dress, carefully brushes several platinum-blonde wig hairs out of Lady Gaga's zombie eyes.

    The most-famous-at-this-very-moment pop star in the world, on the cover of Time as we speak, is beyond exhausted. "I am hallucinating," Gaga says as she sips coffee through a straw. She has been up for more than 20 hours straight, shooting her latest video in Los Angeles, after which she boarded a private plane and flew directly to New York City to be photographed with Oprah not to mention perform at the Metropolitan Museum Costume Institute gala the next evening for the party that kicks off and celebrates in splendid high style the institute's newest exhibition, "American Woman: Fashioning a National Identity" (through August 15).

    These two very particular women one, the quintessential American Woman and cochair of the event; the other, a bizarre and brilliant and peculiarly American pastiche of seemingly every woman and a few men, most obviously Madonna, Cher, and Elton John are posing together for Mario Testino in a cocktail lounge at the Mark Hotel. It's the very same room where, in just 24 hours, Oprah will attend the decadent after-the-Met party, where she will be the one to carry on like a rock star till the wee hours while Gaga finally gets some sleep.

    For now, the two are girlishly bonding despite being fussed over, with seven or eight hands in each of their faces. Oprah says to Gaga, "Didn't we have a time when you were on my show? That was a time. We had a moment." Gaga replies, "That was a really special day for me." Suddenly Testino, who has been hunched over a computer looking at the photos, shouts, "In-sane¬†!" Gaga and Oprah scurry over to see...

    How appropriate‚Äîhow accurate!‚Äîher name is. It is more of a title, really, one she bestowed upon herself mere moments before she became so insanely famous. The Gaga half makes immediate, intuitive sense, an utterance that sounds like an infant‚Äôs first word but is, in fact, French and means, essentially, to be utterly enthralled by something‚Äîexcited to the point of being touched by madness. (That it describes both the pop star and her uniquely obsessed fans makes it even more perfect.) But it is the Lady part of her name that has gone underexplored.

     Put aside for a moment that she often appears in public with no pants on, or that she performs part of her show covered in blood, or that she screams like Sam Kinison onstage, or that she says the F-word with metronomic consistency. In person, she is unfailingly polite and surprisingly dignified. She speaks in the clipped, proper diction that is often mistaken for a Madonna-like pretension but is in fact born of twelve years of attending Convent of the Sacred Heart, the oldest private girls‚Äô school in Manhattan, where Gloria Vanderbilt matriculated, an institution known for turning out self-possessed young ladies who speak perfect French and have the vocabularies of William F. Buckley, Jr. Indeed, what surprises me most during the time I spend embedded with the pop star‚Äîinside the giant plastic bubble, so to speak‚Äîwhile she is on tour in London and Paris at the end of December is how effortlessly she switches back and forth between ‚Äúlady‚Äù and ‚Äúgaga.‚Äù

     It is a few hours before the start of the Monster Ball, the last of five sold-out shows at London‚Äôs O2 arena, and I am sitting in an empty lounge backstage, waiting for Gaga to arrive. The room‚Äîthe contents of which travel with the tour (28 trucks and fourteen buses; 140 people) from city to city‚Äîis outfitted like a VIP area in a nightclub: low black leather sectionals, silver floor lamps, a stocked bar, a huge stereo system, and little black cocktail tables set with bowls of miniature candy bars. She is an hour late. Suddenly the curtains part and Lady Gaga makes her entrance, mincing into the room holding a porcelain teacup and saucer in one hand and a wineglass for me in the other. (Like fainting on command or dropping a glove, the long-lost art of making an entrance, which Gaga seems to have single-handedly revived, is a remarkably effective way to shift the conversation.) ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the idea of you having to drink wine out of a plastic cup,‚Äù she says as she makes her way toward me, one tiny step at a time. She proffers her powdered cheeks for a kiss-kiss as a bottle of Sancerre is opened, which she insists on serving to me herself. ‚ÄúPouring your own wine is bad luck,‚Äù she says.

     She is still in her day look: a slinky black-and-white striped dress‚Äîa gown, really‚Äîwith a four-foot train and shoes that‚Äîdo I even need mention?‚Äîmake her feet look as if they are screwed on backward. The heels bring her nearly up to my height of six feet. (She is five feet one.) She has a Bride of Frankenstein updo, with a brooch perched on top. Gaga glances down at the bowl of candy on the coffee table in front of us, shoots me a look over the top of her granny glasses, and deadpans, ‚ÄúWhat, the Mars bars aren‚Äôt doing it for you?‚Äù I have eaten three of them, I tell her, and she apologizes profusely for making me wait. She then asks an assistant to bring us a proper spread, which arrives moments later and consists of enough filet mignon to feed twelve people.

     Lady Gaga may be behaving as if she were a member of Marie Antoinette‚Äôs coterie‚Äîthe powdered wig, the binding costume, the impeccable courtliness‚Äîbut it‚Äôs a far cry from what I witnessed the night before. After catching her performance, I was ushered backstage to her dressing room and found a scene that seemed entirely unhinged. Gaga herself looked like a lunatic: Barefoot, still covered in fake blood, mascara running down her face, she was careening around the room in a robe made of red feathers like a cross between Alice Cooper and Big Bird. There were dancers running in and out, mixing and spilling drinks, and a peanut gallery of strangely bedazzled gay men sitting on the sofas singing ‚ÄúAdelaide‚Äôs Lament,‚Äù from Guys and Dolls, which Gaga joined in on when she wasn‚Äôt bouncing off the walls.

    <i key="98d399fb-a9b6-44e0-b073-afd26af69c56">
     Gaga stumbled up to me to say hello and then introduced me to the guy she was hanging all over: a tall, boyishly cute heavy metal‚Äìlooking dude with a mullet, wearing a sleeveless black leather vest. ‚ÄúThis is Luc,‚Äù she said proudly. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my boyfriend.‚Äù He looked down at her for a moment, and a knowing grin crossed his face. ‚ÄúOK, Bette Midler,‚Äù he said. Moments later I was ushered out of the room by Wendi Morris, Gaga‚Äôs road manager‚Äîin an effort, it seemed to me, to protect Gaga from herself. As I was walking through the curtains I looked back, and Gaga was in Luc‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúJonathan, wait,‚Äù she whined like a teenage girl in need of attention. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you want to stay and ask me some questions?‚Äù Obvious to everyone but herself: not the time for an interview.

     What a difference a day makes. Back in the arena not 24 hours later, she is serene, sober, and sipping tea out of her fancy cup. What did you do today? I ask, and the answer is probably not what her millions of adoring fans would expect. ‚ÄúI stayed in bed all day,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI do this very strange thing with my foot when I am feeling lonely. I rub my left foot with the right foot. Is that weird?‚Äù

     Gaga can be forgiven for being wiped out. She has been on tour for three years without a real break, and on the road with the Monster Ball since February 2009. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs call a spade a spade here,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI am really fucking tired. I am at that last mile of the marathon when your fingers and your toes are numb and you can‚Äôt feel your body, and I am just going on adrenaline. But in the overarching objective of my life, I am really only at mile two. I try to keep that in mind.‚Äù

     If you have not seen Lady Gaga live, you do not know from Lady Gaga. In an arena, her music, which has often been dismissed as run-of-the-mill Euro-pop‚Äîsomehow not edgy or deep enough‚Äîtakes flight. It is as if each song were written for the express purpose of being belted‚Äîroared‚Äîin front of 20,000 people on an extravagant stage set with ten dancers taking up the rear. She manages to go from insane, over-the-top rock opera to syncopated dance routine to intimate, boozy piano ballad and then back again, through thirteen costume changes, without ever losing her total command of the stage. The fact that she has a huge voice, plays the piano and the stand-up bass, and wrote every lyric and melody herself adds to the sense that you are in the presence of a true artist who has only just begun to show what she‚Äôs made of.

     Of course she‚Äôs comfortable onstage. She has been playing the piano since she was four and by eleven was performing in big recitals. As she puts it, ‚ÄúI was a strange, loud little kid who could sit at the piano and kill a Beethoven piece.‚Äù Still showing no false modesty, Lady Gaga says of herself now, ‚ÄúSpeaking purely from a musical standpoint, I think I am a great performer. I am a talented entertainer. I consider myself to have one of the greatest voices in the industry. I consider myself to be one of the greatest songwriters. I wouldn‚Äôt say that I am one of the greatest dancers, but I am really quite good at what I do.‚Äù Big words from someone who‚Äôs only been around for three years. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs OK to be confident in yourself,‚Äù she says.

     Her fans couldn‚Äôt agree more. They hang on her every word, scream when she screams, and dance throughout the entire two-hour-long extravaganza. At one show, I stood in the wings and watched as at least a dozen women were pulled out of the crush in front of the barricades and taken away on stretchers because they were overcome and near collapse.

     It is no secret that Lady Gaga has an especially intense relationship with her fans, whom she refers to as her ‚Äúlittle monsters.‚Äù She has said more than once, ‚ÄúI see myself in them.‚Äù Why is that? ‚ÄúI was this really bad, rebellious misfit of a person‚ÄîI still am‚Äîsneaking out, going to clubs, drugs, alcohol, older men, younger men. You imagine it, I did it. I was just a bad kid. And I look at them, and every show there‚Äôs a little more eyeliner, a little more freedom, and a little more ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt give a fuck about the bullies at my school.‚Äô For some reason, the fans didn‚Äôt become more Top 40. They become even more of this cult following. It‚Äôs very strange and exciting.‚Äù

     Unlike the chilly, hyperchoreographed seduction of Madonna, say, or the manufactured pop of Britney or Janet, Lady Gaga‚Äôs performance style is raw and emotional. ‚ÄúI am quite literally chest open, exposed, open-heart surgery every night on that stage, bleeding for my fans and my music. It‚Äôs so funny when people say, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs amazing to see how hard you work.‚Äô We‚Äôre supposed to work hard! I have the world at my fingertips. I am not going to saunter around the stage doing pelvic thrusts and lip-synching. That‚Äôs not at all why I am in this. I don‚Äôt feel spiritually connected to anyone in Hollywood makeup and a gown with diamond earrings on. I am just a different breed. I want to be your cool older sister who you feel really connected with, who you feel understands you and refuses to judge anything about you because she‚Äôs been there.‚Äù

     Her relationship with her fans occasionally seems to verge on unhealthy, as if both sides were overly invested in something that in the end is impossible. I bring up a YouTube video that got a lot of attention in late November, in which Gaga is crying in an arena in Poland as she talks to the audience. ‚ÄúSometimes, being onstage is like having sex with my fans,‚Äù she explains. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre the only people on the planet who in an instant can make me just lose it.‚Äù

     When she talks about her fans, one hears shades of messianic zeal. ‚ÄúI want for people in the universe, my fans and otherwise, to essentially use me as an escape,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI am the jester to the kingdom. I am the route out. I am the excuse to explore your identity. To be exactly who you are and to feel unafraid. To not judge yourself, to not hate yourself. Because, as funny as it is that I am on the cover of Vogue‚Äîand no one is laughing harder than I am‚ÄîI was the girl in school who was most likely to walk down the hallway and get called a slut or a bitch or ugly or big nose or nerd or dyke. ‚ÄòWhy are you in the chorus?‚Äô ‚Äù (She‚Äôs more Glee than Gary Glitter in some ways.)

     For Gaga, the stakes are high. ‚ÄúBecause as an artist and as a performer, the person that they look up to to create this space of freedom and escapism, I want to give my fans nothing less than the greatest album of the decade.

     Gaga herself is very open about her influences. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a secret that I have been inspired by tons of people,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúDavid Bowie and Prince being the most paramount in terms of live performance.‚Äù She also seems to have made peace with the fact that she is compared to‚Äîor, less charitably, accused of ripping off‚Äînearly every artist of the last 50 years. ‚ÄúI could go on and on about all of the people I have been compared to‚Äîfrom Madonna to Grace Jones to Debbie Harry to Elton John to Marilyn Manson to Yoko Ono‚Äîbut at a certain point you have to realize that what they are saying is that I am cut from the cloth of performer, that I am like all of those people in spirit.‚Äù She takes a bite of filet mignon and says with her mouth full, ‚ÄúShe was born this way.‚Äù

     Lady Gaga‚Äôs new album, Born This Way, does not come out until May, but the first single, of the same name, is, by the time you are reading this, no doubt blaring from the radio. I first hear the song when Gaga, iPod in hand, gets up from the sectional where we have been sitting, walks over to the stereo, plugs it in, and then looks at me and says, ‚ÄúAre you ready? I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre ready.‚Äù She turns it up to eleven. The song at first sounds suspiciously like a Madonna tune and then switches into something that feels a bit like a Bronski Beat hit and then finally transforms into its own thing: a Gaga original. Clearly an homage to the obscure underground disco record ‚ÄúI Was Born This Way‚Äù; it is an unbelievably great dance song, destined to be the anthem of every gay-pride event for the next 100 years.

     She tells me that Elton John pronounced it the ‚Äúgayest song‚Äù he had ever heard. ‚ÄúI wrote it in ten fucking minutes,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúand it is a completely magical message song. And after I wrote it, the gates just opened, and the songs kept coming. It was like an immaculate conception.‚Äù She plays a few more songs and mentions a few others‚Äîwith tantalizing titles like ‚ÄúHair,‚Äù ‚ÄúBad Kids,‚Äù and ‚ÄúGovernment Hooker.‚Äù

     The second single to be released is called ‚ÄúJudas‚Äù and is, typically, a mash-up: The melody sounds like it was written for the Ronettes, but it is set to a sledgehammering dance beat and is about falling in love with backstabbing men of the biblical variety. Another song, ‚ÄúAmericano,‚Äù which she describes as like ‚Äúa big mariachi techno-house record, where I am singing about immigration law and gay marriage and all sorts of things that have to do with disenfranchised communities in America,‚Äù has a resounding Piafesque chorus. Turns out it was intentional. ‚ÄúIt sounds like a pop record, but when I sing it, I see Edith Piaf in a spotlight with an old microphone.‚Äù (Piaf is an apt reference‚Äîthey both evince a similar brand of heroic vulnerability.) But, she says, ‚Äúthere are some very rock-‚Äôn‚Äô-roll moments on the album, too: There‚Äôs a Bruce Springsteen vibe, there‚Äôs a Guns N‚Äô Roses moment. It‚Äôs the anthemic nature of the melodies and the choruses.‚Äù She feels it‚Äôs different from‚Äîand better than‚Äîanything she‚Äôs done before. ‚ÄúIt is much more vocally up to par with what I‚Äôve always been capable of. It‚Äôs more electronic, but I have married a very theatrical vocal to it. It‚Äôs like a giant musical-opus theater piece.‚Äù

     Troy Carter, Lady Gaga‚Äôs manager, tells me that she recorded the entire album‚Äîall seventeen songs‚Äîon the road over the last year and a half, ‚Äúwhich is not the ideal situation for most artists,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut for her it was great because she was able to tap into the emotions inside of those arenas. We would have a conversation backstage about something, and the next day she‚Äôd play me a song relating to the conversation that we just had! Watching the creative process with her is incredible.‚Äù

     Carter‚Äôs partner, Vincent Herbert, whom Gaga credits with discovering her in 2007 on Myspace, has worked as a producer with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. ‚ÄúShe made songs that are going to touch people,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe song ‚ÄòBorn This Way‚Äô just takes your breath away.

     Gaga‚Äôs musical tastes are all over the map, which partly explains why she feels so comfortable in London. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she says, ‚ÄúI have a very broad taste in music, and the English don‚Äôt differentiate the rock star from the pop star. It‚Äôs all the same thing.‚Äù But there is more to it. American music critics, for example, insist on defining her with dizzying numbers of pop-music references, but the fashion world sees something more precise: the influence of a very specific tribe of English eccentrics‚ÄîLeigh Bowery, Isabella Blow, et al. ‚ÄúThe fashion community in general got me much earlier than everyone else,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBut actually, I felt truly embraced by this London cultural movement, that McQueen, Isabella, Daphne Guinness wing of the English crowd. I remember when I first started doing photo shoots, people would say, ‚ÄòMy God, you look so much like Isabella Blow, it scares me.‚Äô And McQueen used to say, ‚ÄòOh, my God, your boobs!‚Äô He actually grabbed both of them and said, ‚ÄòEven your boobs are like hers!‚Äô ‚Äù

     Like those style icons, Gaga demonstrates a commitment to outrageous self-presentation that makes every crazy costume worn by Elton or Cher or Madonna look like child‚Äôs play. (As Karl Lagerfeld once told me, ‚ÄúI hate average, and she is anything but average.‚Äù) But her determination to outdo them all, and herself, cuts both ways: She has been venerated and vilified for her fashion stunts. Some of her looks have been truly inspired (the red latex Elizabethan gown with sparkly red hearts covering her eyes to meet the queen), delightfully startling (the lace dress that crawled right across her face), downright silly (the Kermit cape), or simply mystifying (the meat dress). She clearly wants and expects a reaction. When she talks about her makeup for the ‚ÄúBorn This Way‚Äù video, she says, ‚ÄúThe whole world is going to hate it in the best kind of way.‚Äù

     Picked up for a M.A.C. Cosmetics campaign early on in her career, Gaga has always worked both within and outside the fashion establishment, collaborating on the one hand with designers like Lagerfeld and Armani and Prada, and on the other with artists like Terence Koh and unknown up-and-comers. ‚ÄúI pay for a lot of fashion myself because I want to support young designers,‚Äù she says. All of her looks are filtered through the stylist Nicola Formichetti, who, along with the rest of her creative team, makes up the Haus of Gaga. Because Formichetti, who was recently appointed the creative director of Thierry Mugler, is in the midst of planning his first show for the house, I ask Gaga about it. ‚ÄúOur relationship does have some influence on the show, but I don‚Äôt want to take any credit for it. Nicola is fashion. He‚Äôs the most remarkable man.‚Äù

     At the end of the day, the way she dresses is part of the entire performance-art aspect of her life. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about a choice,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about a lifestyle that I live and breathe.‚Äù Does she sometimes feel misunderstood? At first she says no but then retracts it. ‚ÄúWell, yes, actually,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThere is this assumption that women in music and pop culture are supposed to act a certain way, and because I‚Äôm just sort of middle fingers up, a-blazing, doing what my artistic vision tells me to do, that is what is misunderstood. People are like, ‚ÄòShe dresses this way for attention.‚Äô Or like, ‚ÄòUgh, the meat dress.‚Äô ‚Äù She rolls her eyes. ‚ÄúPeople just want to figure it out or explain it. The truth is, the mystery and the magic is my art. That is what I am good at. You are fascinated with precisely the thing that you are trying to analyze and undo.‚Äù

     I am sitting in a vast suite in a very swank hotel in Place Vend√¥me in Paris, once again waiting for Gaga to make an entrance. Her road manager, Wendi Morris, is pacing around talking on her cell phone to Troy Carter. ‚ÄúI am not going to ask her that,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúNot now.‚Äù Pause. ‚ÄúIf you pay to have my head reattached to my body, I will ask her.‚Äù She laughs. It should not come as a surprise to anyone that Gaga is not always delightful. She is at the center of a complex multimillion-dollar enterprise that does not run smoothly at all times. Indeed, as an epic snowstorm was shutting down half of Europe, Gaga and her trucks and buses were trying to make their way to Paris. When the caravan got through the Channel Tunnel, the drivers were told that they would have to idle at a way station until the roads were passable. A couple of them decided to shove right on through anyway and were promptly pulled over, the drivers arrested. The quest to free the drivers‚Äîand, more important, the Monster Ball equipment they were ferrying‚Äîin time for the show to go on on Sunday night went all the way up to President Sarkozy. The answer came back: No. The Monster Ball would have to be canceled. Gaga, Morris tells me, was livid.

I think it‚Äôs good for them to know that I care.‚Äù She holds out her hand, which is nearly covered by a serpentine diamond ring. ‚ÄúI am going through an Elizabeth Taylor moment. Don‚Äôt judge me.

Gaga! Gaga!‚Äù A teenage boy pushes to the front. ‚ÄúI am from Milano! Please! Please! Please!‚Äù They are all holding out a scrap of something to be signed or angling to get a picture. The crowd surges forward. A security guy yells, ‚ÄúOne at a time! Take it easy!‚Äù There are girls with tears streaming down their faces. I almost get knocked over. Morris pulls me out of the maw and shoves me into the van, and the doors close behind us. But the fans do not give up. They are banging on the windows, pressing their faces against the glass. ‚ÄúThey are so sweet,‚Äù Gaga says. Not exactly the word I would have chosen.

I was vomiting backstage during the changes.‚Äù I had no idea, I say. ‚ÄúNobody knew,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI just Jedi mind-tricked my body. You will not vomit onstage. Because I was also thinking, If I do, they are going to think I‚Äôm drunk. And I don‚Äôt want them to think I am human, let alone drunk.

     We make our way to Chez Andr√©, and Gaga orders, in perfect French, escargot, steak tartare, and chicken. She likes her protein, this pop star. Moments earlier, when we walked into the restaurant, every person in the room stopped talking and stared, forks suspended in midair. Now, seated in a corner by the window, with a curtain that comes up right to the top of her beehive, I can see people outside on the street jumping up and down, trying to catch a glimpse. Let‚Äôs not forget that her first album is titled The Fame and the second The Fame Monster. ‚ÄúThere is the fame monster, as you can see,‚Äù she says, gesturing outside, ‚Äúbut it also comes from within. It will only change you and affect you if you allow it to. You have to reject all the evils of it and try to turn all the positive things that you can use about fame into great things. Like Don‚Äôt Ask, Don‚Äôt Tell.‚Äù Gaga used her visibility, her unusual connection with her fans, and her social-media prowess to agitate for the repeal of the law, tweeting senators, making protest videos, and speaking at rallies. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me turning my fame into something that is positive and makes me feel good about my life.‚Äù

     I wonder out loud how her parents, Joe and Cynthia Germanotta, have handled all of this. ‚ÄúIt was hard in the beginning, but we have wrestled fame to the ground together,‚Äù she says. Gaga‚Äôs father, who was very involved in her career early on, had heart surgery a few years ago. ‚ÄúI obsess about his health,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm very Italian. I call him every day. I ask my mother if he‚Äôs been smoking. They are in their 50s, and they still live in the same apartment on the Upper West Side. Nothing has changed since I have become a star. I am a real family girl. When it comes to love and loyalty, I am very old-fashioned. And I am quite down-to-earth for such an eccentric person.‚Äù

     One of the most peculiar things about Gaga is that for all the ways she‚Äôs transformed the pop landscape, she herself romanticizes her early days as aspiring musician Stefani Germanotta: ‚ÄúIt was grassroots, downtown New York, blood, sweat, and tears, dancing, music, whiskey, pummeling the streets, playing every venue I could get my hands on. It was the hustle and the grind and the traffic of New York that propelled me to where I am today. I don‚Äôt in any way associate my past with anything other than the hunger and the starvation for success that I still feel. It was the most beautiful time in my life. And funnily enough, I still live in the same apartment, hang out with the same friends, drink at the same bars, and I dance in the same studios with the same dancers. Really, nothing has changed.‚Äù (Is it a coincidence that astronomically successful 20-somethings Gaga and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg have rejected much of the flash and bling of the boom years, live in relatively modest accommodations, and are very close to their families‚Äîor is there a new paradigm for dominators of the Zeitgeist?)

     There are an awful lot of people trying to get in on Gaga‚Äôs creation myth. A mean-spirited book came out in September; an ex-lover and songwriting partner filed a $30 million lawsuit against her (later dismissed); and every bartender she ever kissed on the Lower East Side has a story. When I ask her about her life before she was discovered and signed to Interscope Records, she says, ‚ÄúMy ride through the industry was an interesting one because people loved me but there was a very big raised eyebrow about me. I mean, a big one. So people were kind of like, well, I‚Äôm involved but not really. And as soon as I took off, it was like, I invented her, I made her, I wrote the music.

     We finish lunch and head back through the scrum of paparazzi and into the car for the drive to the arena. She has a show tonight and another tomorrow, the makeup show for the cancellation the night before. Despite the fact that it is just two nights before Christmas Eve, she cannot bear to leave Paris without giving her fans what they have waited so long for. Her cell phone rings. ‚ÄúHi, Mom! . . .

A few miles later, her eyes open, and I tease her. ‚ÄúMy friends tell me that I recharge like a robot,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúJimmy Iovine, the chairman of Interscope, actually laughs at me: Whenever I have ridden on a plane with him I have fallen asleep, and apparently I don‚Äôt move.

      Dream Girl
     </b>
     Whether touring the globe with a ground breaking extravaganza or launching on out-of-this-world fragrance, Lady Gaga is meeting the future on her own wildly inventive terms.
     It's well past midnight at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo, the sleek skyscraper hotel made famous by the film Lost in Translation, and at this hour, it seems there are more staff than guests. I'm just coming back from a night out when suddenly there's a commotion in the formal, hush-hush lobby. A young, handsome guy appears and begins signaling to someone around the corner whom I cannot see. Then he says, in a loud whisper, "The coast is clear!" At that, a woman pushing a wheelchair comes around the corner and scurries across the lobby to the elevator. The person in the wheelchair is listing to the side, as if drunk, and is covered by a shroud, or what appears to be an oversize Hermes scarf (Could be Versace. Hard to say. They are moving very quickly.) And then‚Äîwhoosh‚Äîjust like that, all three sweep into an open elevator and are whisked up, up, and away.
     Had to be Gaga. She's staying here for a three-night stand with the Born This Way Ball at the Saitama Super Arena. When I finally meet up with her in a suite at the hotel a few days later, it's the first thing I bring up. Gaga is in exaggerated-tacky mode, wearing a plasticky shift that she bought in Harajuku earlier today. It is the color of a trash bag and is quilted, with a big Chanel logo across the chest; but it is so obviously fake that it asks you to laugh and not worry about its provenance. She is also wearing so much "gold" jewelry‚Äîbangles and necklaces and giant hoop earrings‚Äîthat even the tiniest of movements creates a symphony of jingle-jangle. Her hair (or wig) is dyed two shades-blonde and a coppery color she calls "fox"-and has been swept up into a high ponytail on the right side of her head. ("I love my side pony," she says. "It instantly makes me feel like I am four and three-quarters.") When I get to the part about the seemingly incapacitated woman covered by a giant, chic scarf being wheeled through the lobby, she narrows her eyes and says, breathlessly, "Fabulous."Then she abruptly shakes her head: Nope. Sorry to disappoint. Wasn't me.
     It so could have been you, I argue.
     "Yes, it could have... " she says as she sits up straight, perhaps recognizing an opportunity to sow a bit of mischief. "I should just say, 'Yes, it was me.' "
     That I just assumed it was Gaga says an awful lot about how deeply her brand of high jinks has seeped into our subconscious. The fashiony shroud . . . the tragicomic wheelchair .. . the public "drunkenness"- all plays from the Lady's handbook. And the fact that I still don't know whether it was Gaga or not is exactly the point. She doesn't care whether it's "true" or "false," as there is more frisson- more zest, more fun- in the wondering.
     Gaga has always had a peculiar relationship with the truth. She has said many times onstage, "I hate the truth so much that I would prefer a giant dose of bullshit any day." (Even the veracity of that statement is in question.) This playful slipperiness is one of the many reasons the people of Japan have taken such a shine to her. When she performs here, many of her exceptionally devoted Japanese fans rise to the occasion by wearing magnificent contraptions of their own. Over the next week, some of them will camp outside the hotel for hours, days, sometimes in the pouring rain, waiting to see Mother Monster's mini-motorcade come and go. Occasionally, she will ask her driver to stop, the van's door will slide open, and the eerily ruly mob will gently surge forward, reach for her, sob, but otherwise remain almost entirely silent. As Lady Gaga herself puts it, "I think some of it has to do with the obsession with fantasy. The blurring of fantasy and reality is something that the Japanese herald in their life, in their day-today commercialism. In a way, I think I sort of just fit right in over here."
     Come to think of it, there is something Japanese about the DNA of the entire Gaga enterprise. The obsession with monsters; the one-part scary, one-part cute aspect to the Lady herself (think Godzilla, think Mothra); the powdered-geisha vibe; the Murakami-like magical realism. She is even the subject of a Nobuyoshi Araki exhibit large-format black and-white photos of her tied up and naked- that is being mounted in a pop-up gallery in a giant shopping mall not far from our hotel: She is the only non-Japanese woman he has photographed for his scandalous bondage series. As one Japanese record executive tells me, "Everyone loves her here, even grandmothers who have never heard her music." Gaga was one of the first to donate more than $1 million for relief after the earthquake and tsunami, and she has been to the country many times, before and since that terrible tragedy. In some ways, she is like an adopted national hero, the ultimate Japanese mascot- a cartoonish human plush toy.
     There's also the fact that the spirit of the Club Kid, that early-nineties New York City invention (a moment that clearly left a mark on LG), has never died in Tokyo. Young people in this city routinely dress as if they are heading to a costume ball--or as if they are five years old. In fact, six such women --Miki, Mio, Lisa, Junko, Meg, and Kaoru--come backstage to say hello after Gaga's show one night, which happens to fall on Mother's Day. She is dressed in a hooded, full-length, loose-fitting silky robe covered in a Gothy pattern of roses and tiny skeletons, which was designed by Donatella Versace (as were many of the costumes for the tour).
     "I miiiiisssss yoooooou," says Gaga in that sleepy whine of hers. A girly hugfest ensues. Calling them by their first names, Gaga asks about their lives. They tell her that they all traveled to New York City together and went to her parent's restaurant, Joanne. "Did you meet my mom?" she says.. Someone whips out a cell phone and hands it to Gaga. She turns to show me the picture: "Look how cute they are. They all have Little Monster jackets on" It is hard to imagine any other star of this magnitude being so intimate with her fans. Later Gaga will tell me, "I love them. I've seen them every single year when I come to Tokyo and they travel all around the world to come see me. They are just so special and wonderful and sweet!"
     Hovering nearby filming all of this is the photographer Terry Richardson, who followed Gaga during the Monster Ball for last fall's photo book Lady Gaga x Terry Richardson and is now back, capturing her every move for what may become a documentary or, one hopes, something weirder. As Richardson's camera is rolling, the girls announce that they have rehearsed a little show. What follows is simply beyond description, but suffice it to say that with its stilted dialogue peppered with self-consciously naughty language, it is one of the most awkwardly poignant moments I have ever witnessed. As the skit comes to an end, Miki announces that they have an "award" for Lady Gaga. She rolls out a five-foot-long piece of red fabric on the floor as one of the other girls sets an elaborate box at one end. "Is this the red carpet?" asks Gaga beginning to laugh. "Yes!" they say, in unison. She takes two tiny steps on it, gets down on her knees, and opens the box - Encased in glass is a replica of the now-familiar Lady Gaga "paw"-- a clawed hand that looks like it is trying to dig its way out of a shallow grave, but covered in jewels. Gaga sucks in a breath. "I love it!" she says. "Did you have this made?"
     "We made it."
     "You made this?" she says. "I'm going to take care of it forever." She seems almost embarrassed by the extravagance of the gesture. "You know girls." she says a moment later. "You don't have to bring me any presents. I am always just happy yo see you. Take care of each other, OK?" (Later, I exchanged mails with Miki: "We work so hard n save money to go the show n to meet her b/c she made our life sparkling!')
     Lady Gaga is best experienced live. Her music, her voice, her shtick, her costumes; all better live. As Marla Weinhoff, who art-directed the sets for Gaga's new show, says to me, "I mean, it's a Judy or a Barbra. I've never seen her miss her mark. I've never seen her sing a bad note. I have seen the technology fail her, but she has never let us down." But it's not just her showmanship, it's the presentation of her ideas on the stage -- clever, often brilliant, occasionally sublime- that puts Gaga in a category of her own.
     At the end of 2010, I watched Lady Gaga perform four sold-out arena shows in Europe for a piece for this magazine and while Gaga herself was mesmerizing, the staging was a little hokey- the too-literal monster dominating the set, fine allusions to The Wizard of Oz. That tour had started out in relatively small venues, but in the middle of it, she gained millions of new fans, and the Monster Ball had to be on the fly. In other words, she was not entirely in control.
     The Born This Way Ball, however, is her dream tour, conceived by her from start to finish as a preposterously extravagant spectacle designed for massive arenas all over the world. (After wending its way through Asia and Australia, the tour will head to Europe, arriving in the States early next year.) When I tell her that the show has a kind of spooky feeling to it, that it feels more grown-up, she lets out a yelp. "Yes, it was intentional for this show to be more sophisticated and more elegant--a little cleaner. Sometimes I think that there's a fine line between impressionistic and messy. So we tried to make this more French Impressionistic and less like a child's finger painting." She laughs. "I really wanted to break the mold of what modem touring is right now. The most important thing to me was that there be no video screens. What if we just really simplified all of that so that you just have to watch me and the dancers the whole time?
     The set itself is what she calls a "fortress, or a kingdom," and when Gaga suddenly appears at the top of it, in a turret, dancing 50 feet above the audience, the proceedings take on an air of dread and danger: Tosca on steroids. (The fact that she suffered a concussion a few weeks later only points out how real that danger is.) "No matter how much you rehearse on that stage, once you add 30,000 screaming people with flashing cameras into the equation, it's pretty intense."
     I attended their eighth performance‚Äîand Gaga had stayed up the whole night prior rethinking several elements. "I get these cyclical rushes of creativity that are really exciting," she says. "The day you saw the show, I'd actually changed a lot of things. We had to create new outfits; the Haus of Gaga was sewing all day long‚Äîjust taking something that's already great and making it really great."
     There are some truly disturbing and thrilling moments--like when Gaga floats across the stage in a long white dress wearing a helmet that makes her look like a fabulous alien bug; or when Gaga rolls out into the arena as a human motorcycle, her arms and head draped across the handlebars; or when she and her troupe of dancers do a lengthy homage to Janet Jackson's "Rhythm Nation" to the Gaga song "Schei√üe,"which opens with the line "I don't speak German, but I can if you like." (Schei√üe means "bullshit" in German.) But oddly enough, the set piece in the show that startled and moved me the most was based on the meat dress. When the number first began, I recoiled: Why bring it back? But Gaga took the meat-dress concept, expanded on it, set the whole idea to her Edith Piaf-esque song about immigration, "Americano," and something amazing happened.
     Nothing on the stage is made of actual meat, mind you, but it all looks as if it is from afar. And her strapless little bell-skirt meat dress, it must be said, is adorable. When I tell her how cute she looked in it, she nearly jumps out of her seat. "That was precisely the conversation we had when we made it: Let's take the grotesqueness out of it and make it tailored and sweet." But there is much more going on: Gaga entering stage right, hanging from a meat hook next to huge slabs of beef; male dancers dressed as border agents; female dancers in meat bikinis; a giant meat grinder, quilted and with gold accents, as if it were made by Chanel, that Gaga gets fed into at the end.
     "We were talking about putting the show together," she tells me,
     <i key="1667fc98-e04c-4c36-9999-72044ce0af22">
      And I said, OK, what if I was someone's grandma and I was going to a concert tonight. How would I know that it was a Gaga show? And we all just sort of looked at each other and said, 'The meat dress. ' We talked a lot about the original intention, which was to create an outfit that is indicative of the fact that underneath all of our different skin colors and religions and beliefs, we are all made of flesh and bone. And then this instant image came to my mind, which was from the late seventies, of the woman being put into a meat grinder on the cover of Hustler magazine, which really terrified me when I was a child. So I tried to spin all that into a space of humor and politics and sexuality onstage...
     </i>
     Trust me: It works. A famous folksinger once toLd me, "Rock 'n' roll is a lot of things, but it's rarely ever funny. It takes itself very seriously." If that is the case, then Lady Gaga is performing one of the great magic tricks of the twenty-first century): She's making rock 'n' roll hilarious. And it's not B-52s funny. It's Marina Abramovic funny. You are laughing while you are being awed. When I tell her this, she says, "What's wonderful is that when the show's over and I meet fourteenyear-olds backstage and I say, 'What was your favorite part?' they go, "The meat dreeeesssss!!!!'" She giggles. "So it serves two purposes: You had a transcendent moment, and my fourteen-year-old fans just really like the meat dress."
     After a show one night, I watch as Gaga spontaneously joins the jazz-pop trio performing at the New York Bar at the top of the Park Hyatt. Wearing a black, shiny custom Atelier Versace dress, thigh-high custom Giorgio Armani boots, and fingerless black leather gloves, she perches on a stool between the piano and the bass and growls and scats her way through a rollicking version of the 1950s standard "Orange Colored Sky." In the middle of the song, a tipsy American tourist in the audience says, way too loudly, "I love her now! I never really liked her before now!"
     Gaga's musical abilities are fairly well documented at this point, but there are still great swaths of people who can‚Ä¢see past the freaky costumes, dismissing her as a lightweight or a carnival sideshow~somehow not the genuine article.. When I bring up this gentleman's revelation (it was captured on YouTube), Lady Gaga surprises me with her equanimity. "Well, in his defense ..." she laughs. "My records don't always lend themselves to me enchanting you with my vocals stylings or my jazz chops. So you can't be upset about people not knowing about things that you don't make available to them." Gaga's songs sound, for the most part, like party music designed for the dance floor. "I don't really make records for people to listen and go, 'Wow, she's a genius.' I'd really like for you to order another drink, maybe kiss the person who yon came with that evening, or rediscover something about your past that makes you feel more brave."
     "Born This Way," the single, was the fastest -selling single in iTunes history, but Born This Way, the album, despite getting enthusiastically mixed reviews, was considered something of a disappointment. When I ask Gaga if she was pleased with its reception, she says, with a somewhat forced blase air, "Sure. I really couldn't ask for anything more. The tour is sold out. We sold eight million records." And then she says, "Everything is great," which makes me think that there must have been some days when everything was not so great.
     Some of the letdown probably had to do with the fact that Born This Way happened to come out the same season as Adele's juggernaut, 21, which shot to number one, won every award on planet Earth, and refuses to cede its spot at the top of the charts. The freak-of-nature success of that album has led to all manner of comparison: Adele, not Gaga, is the voice of their generation; acoustic music, soul music, real music-not Gaga's wall of electronic sound-is what people yearn to hear.
     Despite the fact that electronic music has, at long last, ascended into the mainstream, it's still not always taken seriously. When I bring this up, Gaga says, "Well, I think we both know that acoustic music isn't better than electronic music. Electronic music requires a tremendous amount of technical expertise- really knowing the mathematics and beauty of music. At the risk of sounding like a snob, if you don't really understand how to make electronic music, it might be much easier for you to write it off as low-brow."
     But Lady Gaga gets to have it both ways. Adele appeals to multiple generations, partly because she admires the sound of an earlier era, music that tugs at the heartstrings of people who still buy CDs. Gaga, on the other hand, courts controversy, not easy listeners. She's like a one-woman generation gap, an iconoclast who agitates for social and political change (witness her Born This Way Foundation). At the same time, she is a nimble-enough musician that she can re-orchestrate her songs and sing them live in every style imaginable, as she did last year when she rewrote her song "You and I" for Bill and Hillary at the president's sixty-fifth-birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl.
     She is also nimble enough, technologically speaking, to pivot from being one of the most "liked" people on Facebook- and the undisputed Queen of Twitter (with more than 27 million followers}-to being the first celebrity to create her very own social network, littlemonsters.com, which debuted in mid-July. (Why should Zuckerberg get all the traffic?) Short of asking fans to perform in her stead, it's the next logical step for an artist who claims she "will continue to become whatever it is they would like for me to be."
     "I'm not the beginning anymore." she says. "I don't really see myself anymore as the center. They're the center. I'm the atmosphere around it." She is also careful not to view her fans around the world as one undifferentiated mass. "I try to find ways to get to know the fan bases individually and then bring them together through the music. That's the challenge."
     Indeed, her biggest worry while we are in Tokyo is her upcoming performance in Indonesia. She had scheduled her show there to take place in the 52,000-seat Bung Karno Stadium, the biggest venue in Jakarta (which was one of the fastest-selling dates on the tour). "Everyone's telling me we may not be able to go, and that's making me very upset. Because for me, that's precisely why we need to go: because there are extremist groups there that are violent, and that's where the message of Born This Way is most needed. It has nothing to do with the way that I dress or how I sound; it has everything to do with the power of the message and the mobilization of youth." You have them worried, I say. "Yes, as if I'm coming in with my homosexual laser-beam gun and making everybody gay." (The show was ultimately canceled after threats of violence.)
     When it comes to criticism and controversy, you seem tougher than most chicks, I say.
     "I am tougher than most chicks. I would say that I am tougher than most people. I am rarely truly shaken to my core in an ego-driven way. Of course things can catch me off guard, but for the most part I'm pretty focused on the work, and that sort of saves me from all the noise." She looks down for a moment and fiddles with her bracelets. "It's easy when you become successful to feel that shallow pool of water pulling you closer and closer. So you just have to remind yourself: That's not me, remember? And it only takes a second."
     Most people who spend time in Gaga's orbit come away from the experience in a state of stunned amazement. As Terry Richardson puts it, "The girl just knows how things go together, what works. Everybody invited into that energy feels it-just bubbles, it moves." This is exactly what I felt when I followed her for a week in 2010. But I also came away feeling something else: concern. She was manic at times, occasionally verging on unhinged, and she seemed exhausted, to the point where she fell asleep in the middle of one of our talks. How is she going to keep this up? How can an artist reinvent herself so elaborately every day and not get lost?
     But now, in Tokyo, Gaga seems not only calmer and more focused but also more mature. Perhaps she's fully embraced the fact that she's in control of an enterprise with a lot of moving parts, including more than 100 people and a multimillion-dollar stage set that travels the world in three 747s. One night backstage I see her get into a heated conversation with her choreographer, Richy Jackson, about moving the band to the top of the castle. Richy disagrees with her. "It's just hard for the band," he says. "But I will dance around them up there," says Gaga. "I am only up there twice." Long pause. "Richy, just trust me." He lets out a big sigh and says, "Ohhhhh-kay. We'll move them." As Jackson walks away, Gaga says, "Love you!"
     With the Haus of Gaga, she's surrounded herself with people she loves and admires. "The Haus has become this intensely wonderful group of friends of mine who are just so gifted," she says. "And when you watch your friends become even greater at what they do, you just feel proud. Because, look, I'm not the only thing they're ever going to work on. I'm just sort of the vehicle right now for all of their creativity."
     Marla Weinhoff, who worked with Richard Avedon for many years and first met Gaga when she was hired to do the production design for the "Born This Way" video, is now the art director of the Haus of Gaga. "My cynical friends in fashion don't believe me when I tell them that all of the ideas come from her, but it's true. It all comes from her head, her dreams. Avedon was the first photographer I ever worked with, and I felt so inspired creating these images that I knew would last forever. The process was unbelievable. And I feel like I really have that with her and her team." But, she adds, "You can't come with a huge ego. If you can somehow feel her world and feel what she's trying to say and do, then it's amazing."
     This, not surprisingly, is exactly what happened with the folks at Coty, the perfume company that partnered with Gaga to develop Fame, her first fragrance; after some resistance, they fell under Gaga's spell. "She only wants to have a very high-end creative collaboration with people she trusts," says Yael Tuil, the vice president of global marketing at Coty, "so we have been working with Nick Knight, who designed the bottle, and Steven Klein on the campaign."
     At the very first meeting, Gaga told the Coty executives that she had an idea. She wanted the fragrance in the bottle to be black but, when sprayed, to become clear. "I was pregnant at that time," says Tuil, who speaks in a thick French accent. "I started to sweat on my forehead. I said, 'My God! That's impossible! How can we do that?' "But Gaga insisted: She would not sign a contract unless they could figure it out. So Coty set the R&amp;D scientists to work, and they eventually came out of the lab with a liquid that did exactly that. Voila! Now Coty has a patent pending for this opaque-to-clear technology. "She was really behind the most important innovation in the fragrance industry in the last 20 years," says Tuil. "She is really pushing boundaries."
     In Tokyo, I tell Lady Gaga that I was skeptical at first of her having a celebrity fragrance. But after seeing the eggshaped bottle (inspired by the sculptor Constantin Brancusi) with the black "juice" sloshing around inside of it, the outrageous ad campaign, I came around. When I almost apologize to Gaga for doubting her, she says, "No! I think it's good that you doubted me. It's a fragrance! You have to raise an eyebrow. I appreciate that. I raised an eyebrow. I didn't really want to do it at first. But I wanted to create a fragrance that somebody who makes fragrances says, 'Well, how did they do that?' And of course, once it smelled so good everyone said, 'Can't we just make it clear so we don't have to explain to people that it won't get on your clothes?' And I said, no. The fragrance is called Fame; it must be black. It must smell enticing. You must want to lick and touch and feel it, but the look of it must terrify you."
     Gaga eventually came to view the entire project, but especially the ad campaign, as a kind of punk-rock experiment: "We thought, Let's just make the most epic fragrance campaign of all time and let's not care at all about whether they can even print it or show it on TV Let's just do everything we ever dreamed of. We basically did this purely for the pleasure of working together. We were just sort of sitting in the comer going, 'I can't believe they are letting us do this!'"
     One evening, we pile into a couple of vans and drive in the pouring rain for nearly an hour to Sumida, an industrial neighborhood at the watery edges of Tokyo, to attend a sort of ceremonial opening of the Tokyo Skytree, a broadcast tower with a restaurant and observation deck at the top-the tallest tower in the world. Before leaving the hotel, Gaga is tom about what to wear. "Should I change?" she says to no one in particular, and I can feel her team holding their breath. (Gaga changing outfits, as one can imagine, is akin to launching the space shuttle.) Yes, it is decided. She will change. She slips into her hotel suite and, a very long while later, reappears wearing a plastic star in her hair and the craziest little dress in Japan. It is made out of hundreds of tiny plastic mirrors that have been sewn together into origami-like boxes. "It was just lying in front of my door one morning," she tells me, "with no note, no name. I have no idea where it came from." She has decided to take it for a spin, knowing that it will be photographed by every news outlet in the country, in the hope that the designer will come forward.
     As we pull out of the underground garage, we stop to say hello to the couple dozen soaking-wet Japanese kids who are waiting, as always, to catch a glimpse of her. I wonder out loud about the reality of living with so much fame.‚Ä¢ "It's definitely much more difficult for me to go take a walk," she says. "I can't really do those sorts of things anymore. Yesterday, I went out in Harajuku and bought some $10 bustiers and had an ice-cream cone. So I got to do normal New York- girl stuff for a moment in Tokyo." Did you go unbothered? "No," she says, "There were a thousand people following me down the street. But I love all those people, so it's OK."
     Can she ever enjoy a private moment outside? "I'm a complete free spirit, so, even though you don't see it, I still find time to have sex at night on the beach when no one's around. Or roll into a bar and get fucked up and dance with my top off. It's just that no one ever sees that, because I have great, real friends who never let me do it when I would get caught. Or, I shouldn't say that. I don't worry about people seeing any of those things; it's just that I'm less inclined to do them if there's tons of people around. I like to have private moments, but in public! "Where I can feel a little irresponsible and act like I am nineteen."
     This seems like a fine time to inquire about her love life Lady Gaga has finally moved on from her on-again, off-again relationship with Luc Carl. Lately, she has been photographed looking smitten with the hunky Vampire Diaries actor Taylor Kinney. "I'm just having a really good time performing. Making music, flying around the world to see so-and-so ..." She shoots me a sly, knowing smile. "Look, I'm 26, and I want to make records and party and screw around and wear fake Chanel and do what every other 26-year-old girl wants to do. I don't want to settle down and live in a house yet or anything I just want to keep riding this rainbow."
     When we finally arrive at the Skytree, there is, as promised, a huge press serum, and seemingly hundreds of Japanese officials all dressed exactly alike, who follow us as we traipse around the upper floors searching for a view in vain; we can see nothing but a thick, gray soup. But fortunately Lady Gaga is here, ready to be photographed. She steps up to a microphone and says a few words about "this beautiful country." When she finishes, we head to another floor, where she is presented with some sort of plaque and a big bag of gifts. She reaches into the bag and pulls out a little plush toy: it is Sorakarachan, the Skytree mascot, a cute little cartoony character whose hair is shaped like a star. "It's you," I say. "She has a star for a head." "I know!" she says, and walks away laughing.
     "Just the other day," Lady Gaga tells me later, "someone asked a very good friend of mine what I'm like. And I said, 'Well, what did you say?' And he said, 'I want you to imagine every creative idea you've ever had in your brain. Then I would like you to imagine that those ideas never stop-they come all the time. And then I would like you to imagine that you create every single one of them. That's how I would describe her. It's like there's no little star that doesn't get through her galaxy. She catches every single one and puts it in the sky, and she the most important star that ever existed."

    Lady Gaga‚Äôs house in Malibu is on a relatively nondescript road just off the Pacific Coast Highway, situated in what feels (for Malibu) like a normal suburban neighborhood. When the gates to her compound swing open, you head down a long gravel driveway that threads through the multi-acre property, past the fenced-in ring where she rides her horse, Arabella, past the barns and the stables and the giant barking dogs, Grandpa and Ronnie‚Äîand pull up to a house made of fieldstone that looks, at first glance, as if it belongs in the South of France. A cheerful young fellow greets you at your car, explains that he is the head of security, and asks you to sign an NDA. There are at least a dozen other cars parked around, most of them belonging to people who are doing some kind of work here‚Äîtaking care of the property or the lady in residence in one capacity or another. The whole setup is both grand and yet, somehow, unassuming (for a rock star‚Äôs house in Malibu).

   <p key="d0227786-9ef1-4366-b3c0-79afe1d93f11">
    When Gaga comes down the stairs and makes her entrance on this hot, do-nothing August afternoon, she is wearing a diaphanous periwinkle robe with ruffled edges that sweeps the floor, nothing underneath but a matching bra and thong‚Äîalong with nude kitten heels and Liz Taylor‚Äìworthy diamond jewelry. Having just returned yesterday from a long, restful vacation on some remote tropical island with her boyfriend, she is uncharacteristically tan, and as she leads me out through the French doors into the garden, I can see nearly every one of her tattoos‚Äîand her shapely behind‚Äîthrough the robe. There are roses trembling in the breeze, and a long, sloping, grassy lawn that leads down to a pool and the Pacific Ocean beyond, flickering in the high afternoon sun. ‚ÄúThis is my sanctuary,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMy oasis of peace. I call it my ‚Äògypsy palace.‚Äô ‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="0f810fa0-957b-4137-88a9-e6298477b9ed">
    She bought this palace about four years ago, when she was going through a rough patch‚Äîboth physically and mentally‚Äîand has been spending more and more time here lately. ‚ÄúI just got rid of my place in New York‚Äîit was too hectic every day outside on the street,‚Äù she says. As we stand there looking out at the ocean, I ask if she‚Äôs happy. ‚ÄúYes‚ÄîI‚Äôm focusing on the things that I believe in. I‚Äôm challenging myself. I‚Äôm embarking on new territory‚Äîwith some nerves and some overjoyment.‚Äù (Gaga has a funny habit of making up words that always make perfect sense.) ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an interesting time in my life. It‚Äôs a transition, for sure. It‚Äôs been a decade.‚Äù

    In April, Gaga noted on her Instagram that it was the tenth anniversary of her first single, ‚ÄúJust Dance.‚Äù It was the song of the summer of 2008‚Äîthe final hours of the golden years, just before the economy imploded and the Great Recession took hold‚Äîand almost immediately, she became the biggest pop star in the world, haunting our dreams‚Äîand nightmares‚Äîwith monsters, meat dresses, and some of the stickiest melodies ever written (GAAAA-GA OOOH-LA-LA!). When I ask her what has changed for her over these last ten years, Gaga, who‚Äôs 32, says, ‚ÄúA galaxy,‚Äù and laughs. ‚ÄúThere has been a galaxy of change.‚Äù She pauses for a moment. ‚ÄúI would just say that it‚Äôs been a nonstop whirlwind. And when I am in an imaginative or creative mode, it sort of grabs me like a sleigh with a thousand horses and pulls me away and I just don‚Äôt stop working.‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúYou . . . make friends, you lose friends, you build tighter bonds with people you‚Äôve known for your whole life. But there‚Äôs a lot of emotional pain, and you can‚Äôt really understand what it all means until ten years has gone by.‚Äù

    On October 5, Warner Bros. Pictures will release the fourth iteration of the tragi-musical love story A Star Is Born, starring Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga. The first version came out in 1937, starring Janet Gaynor and Fredric March, followed by Judy Garland and James Mason in 1954 and Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in 1976. Gaga thinks of it less as a remake than as a ‚Äútraveling legacy.‚Äù Directed by Cooper, in his debut, the film is remarkably assured, deeply engaging, and works on several levels: as a romance, a drama, a musical, and something else entirely, almost as if you‚Äôre watching something live, or documentary footage of a good old-fashioned rock-‚Äôn‚Äô-roll concert movie. ‚ÄúI wanted to tell a love story,‚Äù says Cooper, ‚Äúand to me there‚Äôs no better way than through music. With music, it‚Äôs impossible to hide. Every fiber of your body becomes alive when you sing.‚Äù As Sean Penn said, after seeing the film more than once, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best, most important commercial film I‚Äôve seen in so many years,‚Äù and he described the stars as ‚Äúmiracles.‚Äù Cooper and Gaga, and the film itself, are likely to be nominated for all manner of awards.

    Cooper is a revelation, having utterly transformed himself into a booze-and-pills-besotted rock star: He learned how to play guitar, worked with a vocal coach and a piano teacher for a year and a half, and wrote three of the songs. ‚ÄúAll because of Gaga,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúShe really gave me the confidence.‚Äù His singing is astonishingly good. Gaga, whose only acting experience is in some of her early videos (Google the long-form versions of ‚ÄúTelephone‚Äù and ‚ÄúMarry the Night‚Äù if you want to see the early promise), various episodes of American Horror Story, and a couple of cameos in Robert Rodriguez films, not only holds her own with Cooper but somehow manages to make you completely forget that she is Lady Gaga‚Äîno small feat. But what really makes this film sing, as it were, is the impeccable chemistry between the two stars, particularly their early scenes of meeting cute and falling in love, which are some of the most touchingly real and tender moments between two actors I‚Äôve ever seen.

    Gaga and I have moved inside and taken up spots on the boho-chic sofas in the sitting room off her kitchen. She opens a bottle of ros√©. There are candles flickering, cut flowers on the table. Gaga first met Cooper at Saturday Night Live about five years ago, but only briefly, and then one day in 2016‚Äîhaving signed on to make A Star Is Born and in the early stages of figuring out who could play Ally to his Jackson Maine‚Äîhe went to a cancer benefit in Sean Parker‚Äôs backyard in L.A. ‚ÄúShe had her hair slicked back,‚Äù says Cooper, ‚Äúand she sang ‚ÄòLa Vie en Rose,‚Äô and I was just . . . levitating. It shot like a diamond through my brain. I loved the way she moved, the sound of her voice.‚Äù He called her agent and, the next day, drove to Malibu. ‚ÄúThe second that I saw him,‚Äù says Gaga, ‚ÄúI was like, Have I known you my whole life? It was an instant connection, instant understanding of one another.‚Äù Cooper: ‚ÄúShe came down the stairs and we went out to her patio and I saw her eyes, and honestly, it clicked and I went, Wow.‚Äù He pretty much offered her the part on the spot. ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòAre you hungry?‚Äô and I said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm starving,‚Äô and we went into her kitchen for spaghetti and meatballs.‚Äù

    Gaga: ‚ÄúBefore I knew it, I was making him lunch and we were talking. And then he said, ‚ÄòI want to see if we can sing this song together.‚Äô ‚Äù Cooper: ‚ÄúShe was kind of laughing at me that I would be suggesting this, but I said, ‚ÄòThe truth is, it‚Äôs only going to work if we can sing together.‚Äô And she said, ‚ÄòWell, what song?‚Äô And I said, ‚Äò ‚ÄúMidnight Special,‚Äù ‚Äô this old folk song.‚Äù Gaga: ‚ÄúI printed out the sheet music, and he had the lyrics on his phone, and I sat down at the piano and started to play, and then Bradley started to sing and I stopped: ‚ÄòOh, my God, Bradley, you have a tremendous voice.‚Äô ‚Äù Cooper: ‚ÄúShe said, ‚ÄòHas anyone ever heard you sing before?‚Äô and I said no.‚Äù Gaga: ‚ÄúHe sings from his gut, from the nectar! I knew instantly: This guy could play a rock star. And I don‚Äôt think there are a lot of people in Hollywood who can. That was the moment I knew this film could be something truly special.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="b687924d-4ccb-4021-b02a-8859a15ebe7d">
    Cooper: ‚ÄúAnd she said, ‚ÄòWe should film this.‚Äô So I turned on my phone and we did the song. It was crazy. It kind of just worked. And that video is one of the things I showed to Warner Bros. to get the movie green-lit.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="09f3c0e0-7cc6-43ad-bb9e-ceedc461415f">
    Weirdly enough, the film was originally to be directed by Clint Eastwood‚Äîat one point, starring Beyonc√©‚Äîand Eastwood offered Cooper the part of Jackson. ‚ÄúI was 38 then, and I just knew I couldn‚Äôt do it,‚Äù says Cooper, now 43. ‚ÄúBut then I did American Sniper with Clint and The Elephant Man for a year on Broadway and I thought, I‚Äôm old enough now.‚Äù Pop stardom seems to befall mostly the very young these days, but this is a story about grown-ups. ‚ÄúI would often say to Lady Gaga, ‚ÄòThis is a movie about what would have happened if you didn‚Äôt make it until you were 31 instead of 21. We talked a lot about where she started on the Lower East Side, and she told me about this drag bar where she used to hang, and I thought, Oh, this is just ripe for the story.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="ca300edf-3059-4338-bf8f-ea0bf0ac9904">
    Indeed, one of the best scenes in the film comes right at the beginning, when Jack, desperate for a drink, stumbles into a gay bar on drag night. Ally is the only woman the queens let perform on their stage, and as she sings ‚ÄúLa Vie en Rose,‚Äù Jack falls hard. Gaga says that the chemistry between her and Cooper is so good on film because it‚Äôs real. But she also thinks that Cooper ‚Äúnailed‚Äù the complicated voodoo that happens when love and fame get intertwined. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre both very complex, layered things, with a lot of emotional depth, and he captured that. This is what I think makes the film so successful: that it was so real. And I‚Äôve lived it, so I can testify to that.‚Äù (Another thing that gives the film its authenticity: Cooper cast a few drag queens he knew from Philly, as well as Gaga‚Äôs actual dancers, choreographer, and hair and makeup artists, who appear in a few scenes.)

   <p key="e1a68653-cee1-482a-a32d-41c46149b675">
    Last December, I went to Cooper‚Äôs house in Los Angeles to watch some early footage, and as we sat in the screening room he built in his garage, surrounded by guitars and an old piano, his editor cued up scenes. What struck me immediately was how intensely visceral the musical sequences are. Cooper explained that at Gaga‚Äôs insistence, they were all shot live. ‚ÄúAll the music is as real as you can get it,‚Äù he said to me that day. They shot some of the concert scenes at the Stagecoach country-music festival in Indio, California, and more at the Glastonbury Festival in England. ‚ÄúAt Stagecoach, four minutes before Willie Nelson went on, we hopped onstage,‚Äù says Cooper. ‚ÄúThat was real. At Glastonbury, I got onstage in front of 80,000 people. It was nuts. But Lady Gaga is so good that if the world I‚Äôd created wasn‚Äôt authentic, it would stand out in a second. Everything had to be raised to her level.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="0e6ad48f-635d-4065-b086-079ec2dc3b0d">
    One bit of history that‚Äôs gotten lost in the Gaga saga is that while she started playing piano at four and writing songs by eleven, she wanted to be an actress before she wanted to be a singer. When she was twelve, she began taking Method-acting classes at the Lee Strasberg Theatre &amp; Film Institute and later at NYU‚Äôs Tisch School of the Arts. ‚ÄúI loved it so much,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut I was terrible at auditioning‚ÄîI would get too nervous and just couldn‚Äôt be myself.‚Äù So she decided to make a go of it as a musician‚Äîand had a record deal within a year. Was she nervous making a movie? ‚ÄúOf course‚Äîbut I knew I had it in me, in my heart, to give an authentic performance.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="09afa92f-1f20-49eb-a00c-ff2831fc4b16">
    The biggest challenge for Lady Gaga was creating a musical character that was not like . . . Lady Gaga. ‚ÄúI wanted the audience to be immersed in something completely different,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs almost hard to speak about, because I just sort of became Ally.‚Äù For as good as the Garland and Streisand versions are, you do sometimes sort of feel like you‚Äôre watching movies about . . . Garland and Streisand. That being said, there may be no more perfect person to take up this franchise than Gaga. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so humbling,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúJudy Garland is by far my favorite actress of all time. I used to watch her in A Star Is Born, and it‚Äôs devastating. She‚Äôs so real, so right there. Her eyes would get glassy, and you could just see the passion and the emotion and hear the grit in her voice.‚Äù Streisand came to the set one day. ‚ÄúIt was a magical moment. She really made me feel like she passed the torch.‚Äù When I mention Streisand‚Äôs voice, she says, ‚ÄúThe singing is beyond, but what is even more beyond is how involved she was in everything she did. She was a part of creating that film. That made me feel good, too, that we approached making this film the right way.‚Äù

    The soundtrack will be released the same day as the movie, and because this is a Lady Gaga production, she has had a big hand in it. There were many writers and producers who worked on different songs, but the brain trust was Gaga and Cooper, working closely with the blues-oriented producer and songwriter Ben Rice and Lukas Nelson, who‚Äôs Willie‚Äôs son. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a fan of my dad‚Äôs, but she‚Äôs got a tattoo of David Bowie, and Bowie was my hero as well,‚Äù says Nelson. ‚ÄúI tend to gravitate toward rockers who were kind and stood for change and the right to be who you are‚Äîto be a freak and be proud of it. And I think a lot of people have turned to Gaga in that realm‚Äîas a sort of beacon of hope: I can do whatever I want. She invented herself.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="60e73861-d6d0-4118-88dd-19cd0164b5fd">
    It was Gaga‚Äôs idea to thread bits of dialogue throughout the record, and there are a few songs that are not in the movie‚Äî‚Äútreats,‚Äù as she calls them. She asks if I want to hear some music, and we head into a tiny vestibule off the kitchen, a kind of office with a desk, computer, and two very loud speakers. She plugs in her phone and cues up a jaunty, mid-tempo piano banger called ‚ÄúLook What I Found,‚Äù and as it begins to play, Gaga dances and sings along, at full volume, about two feet from my face. Suddenly I feel a bit like James Corden in a new segment: Kitchen Karaoke. I cannot resist, and start dancing too. ‚ÄúOur own little discotheque,‚Äù says Gaga.
   </p>
   <p key="fa0e0994-4881-49e9-ae1c-b84b4c4cb790">
    She cues up another song‚Äîa huge, soaring, sad ballad called ‚ÄúBefore I Cry,‚Äù with a full orchestra. It is the first song for which Gaga composed the string arrangements‚Äîand conducted the orchestra in the studio‚Äîand it was inspired by a harrowing scene in the film when Jack has fallen off the wagon and picks a fight with Ally while she‚Äôs taking a bath. On the soundtrack, it begins with this bit of dialogue:
   </p>
   <p key="c13f9fad-fe03-4af2-bada-6b27acb2424a">
    Ally: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you have another drink and we can just get fucking drunk until we just fucking disappear? Hey! Do you got those pills in your pocket?‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="8f0b1753-2ad9-4f89-b58d-3704adcaa21a">
    Jack: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just fuckin‚Äô ugly, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="b166524d-aafa-49b2-bcd8-67cd8c98672b">
    Ally: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm what?‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="b61ad36e-4587-4495-9ba1-001e88eef071">
    Jack: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just fuckin‚Äô ugly.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="754746a0-e102-4aa5-a65e-99fffe8db80b">
    As the song plays, we stand facing each other in the little cubicle, and before it‚Äôs halfway through, we both have tears in our eyes. She hugs me and, as we head into the kitchen for more wine, says, almost to herself, ‚ÄúI love that we‚Äôre dancing and crying. Like, real Italian style.‚Äù That‚Äôs my natural state, I say: dancing and crying. ‚ÄúMe, too,‚Äù she says.
   </p>
   <p key="64b6fedf-b709-4321-9675-77eefae3b849">
    One of the many things about Lady Gaga that go underappreciated is that she doesn‚Äôt tell us everything. For example, we know very little about her new boyfriend, Christian Carino‚Äîother than that he‚Äôs a 48-year-old CAA agent‚Äîbecause she doesn‚Äôt talk about him. She doesn‚Äôt want to talk at all about the new music she‚Äôs working on for a future album, or the scripts that are suddenly rolling in. She understands more than most that a little bit of mystery and magic go a long way in this world of too much. She has sort of inverse boundaries: She won‚Äôt tell you, for example, where she just went on vacation, but she‚Äôs totally open about having been sexually assaulted when she was a teenager.

   <p key="244a015b-87b4-4323-8917-970bf261a497">
    Her 2015 song ‚Äú Til it Happens to You,‚Äù which she wrote with Diane Warren for the sexual-assault documentary The Hunting Ground, was nominated for an Academy Award. When she performed it at the Oscars in 2016 on a stage full of 50 other assault victims, it eerily presaged the #MeToo movement that unfolded a year later, much to Gaga‚Äôs surprise. ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôve been an advocate but also a shocked audience member, watching #MeToo happen,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still in disbelief. And I‚Äôve never come forward and said who molested me, but I think every person has their own relationship with that kind of trauma.‚Äù

   <p key="a23b5556-e3ec-468b-8a56-f96de6d9597d">
    She was still Stefani Germanotta when she was raped at nineteen by a music producer. She told no one. ‚ÄúIt took years,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúNo one else knew. It was almost like I tried to erase it from my brain. And when it finally came out, it was like a big, ugly monster. And you have to face the monster to heal.‚Äù In late 2016, Gaga revealed in a Today interview that she suffers from PTSD because of the assault. ‚ÄúFor me, with my mental-health issues, half of the battle in the beginning was, I felt like I was lying to the world because I was feeling so much pain but nobody knew. So that‚Äôs why I came out and said that I have PTSD, because I don‚Äôt want to hide‚Äîany more than I already have to.‚Äù When I ask her to describe how she experiences the symptoms, she says, ‚ÄúI feel stunned. Or stunted. You know that feeling when you‚Äôre on a roller coaster and you‚Äôre just about to go down the really steep slope? That fear and the drop in your stomach? My diaphragm seizes up. Then I have a hard time breathing, and my whole body goes into a spasm. And I begin to cry. That‚Äôs what it feels like for trauma victims every day, and it‚Äôs... miserable. I always say that trauma has a brain. And it works its way into everything that you do.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="600270bb-22e4-4165-9a6f-7b6ec017b643">
    In September 2017, Gaga announced on Twitter that she suffers from extreme nerve pain caused by fibromyalgia, a complex and still-misunderstood syndrome she believes was brought on by the sexual assault and that then became worse over time, exacerbated by the rigors of touring and the weight of her fame. (Earlier this year, she had to cut her European tour short by ten shows because of it.) In the Netflix documentary Gaga: Five Foot Two, which aired that same month, Gaga allowed cameras to document her suffering to shed light on the syndrome. ‚ÄúI get so irritated with people who don‚Äôt believe fibromyalgia is real. For me, and I think for many others, it‚Äôs really a cyclone of anxiety, depression, PTSD, trauma, and panic disorder, all of which sends the nervous system into overdrive, and then you have nerve pain as a result. People need to be more compassionate. Chronic pain is no joke. And it‚Äôs every day waking up not knowing how you‚Äôre going to feel.‚Äù

   <p key="84fa75da-c66e-45a0-870a-5fc7b5ae5851">
    Today, Lady Gaga is the picture of health: bright-eyed, sun-kissed, fit as a fiddle. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting better every day,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbecause now I have fantastic doctors who take care of me and are getting me show-ready.‚Äù Speaking of shows, she recently signed a $100 million contract with MGM Resorts International to do a Las Vegas residency at a 5,300-seat theater. It will be called Lady Gaga Enigma, and beginning on December 28 she will perform 74 shows spread out over two years‚Äîa reasonable pace that will allow her to take better care of herself and make more movies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always hated the stigma around Las Vegas‚Äîthat it‚Äôs where you go when you‚Äôre on the last leg of your career,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúBeing a Las Vegas girl is an absolute dream for me. It‚Äôs really what I‚Äôve always wanted to do.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="7a218b7d-2940-4693-81d0-4097a162a81c">
    As she sits before me on our respective couches‚Äîin her periwinkle chiffon, dripping in diamonds‚ÄîGaga and Vegas make perfect sense. She has always been a master at swirling together the nostalgic with the startlingly modern and coming up with something that feels entirely new. Creating the shows for Lady Gaga Enigma, of course, has brought back together the Haus of Gaga‚Äîher team of stylists and monster-conjurers, including Nicola Formichetti. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre plowing away, making something brand-new, but still with the iconography that we‚Äôve already created‚Äîand making sure fans leave with the feeling that they went home for a bit with their community.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="37a945fc-4553-48af-9616-5d0cfc241fc5">
    Speaking of Gaga iconography! I have somehow failed to notice that for the past couple of hours I‚Äôve been sitting next to a half-mannequin with a heavy metal harness wrapped around it that resembles a sort of human/reptilian rib cage and spinal column. It was made by Shaun Leane, a jewelry designer who worked regularly with Alexander McQueen. Gaga picks up another piece, a kind of metal orbiting fascinator, also designed by Leane, that was part of the ‚ÄúSavage Beauty‚Äù exhibition at the Met, and gently sets it on her head. ‚ÄúI bought it at an auction,‚Äù she says, batting her eyelashes. And now she wants to show me something else, and goes in search of a key. She finds it in the kitchen, and then along the way to wherever we‚Äôre going I get a quick tour. In her ballroom-size living room there is a grand piano and a giant modern pink blob sofa, and an even bigger pink rug. ‚ÄúI like pink,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relaxing color.‚Äù There‚Äôs her Golden Globe (for American Horror Story, in 2016) and a framed photograph of Patti Smith, along with pictures of Elton John and David Furnish‚Äôs boys, Zachary and Elijah, Gaga‚Äôs godchildren. Resting on the mantel is a framed letter from David Bowie (‚ÄúDear Lady, Unfortunately I will not be in NYC for a few months but many thanks for the cake‚Äù). On one wall is an enormous George Condo painting of a woman in a ball gown, her face obscured by smears and smudges. ‚ÄúReminds me of myself,‚Äù she says with a wink. ‚ÄúBeautiful but a little bit messy.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="ebf6b300-1092-4266-8f9c-219fdb714d73">
    Finally we arrive at the locked door. She turns the key and opens it to reveal . . . a room filled with fashion! Two rooms! ‚ÄúThis is mostly Saint Laurent from Hedi Slimane‚Äôs work there,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited to see what he‚Äôll be doing at C√©line. Here‚Äôs a McQueen cape that was custom-made for me for the ‚ÄòAlejandro‚Äô video. And then in here‚Äù ‚Äîwe move into yet another chamber, deeper into her fashion closet, racks upon racks of leather and feathers and sequins and a lot of black‚Äî ‚Äúthis is all Gianni Versace from the nineties. I wear some of it, but I mostly collect it to keep and preserve to give to a museum one day. Because I just love these designers.‚Äù Pause. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs my Joanne hat!‚Äù That is the pink fedora she wore in nearly every video and every performance from her Joanne album and tour, when she began presenting herself as... herself, mostly.
   </p>
   <p key="b3f70457-1fbb-4571-b77c-8b1b7516f1c8">
    When did all of the crazy-brilliant obfuscating costumes fall away? ‚ÄúFor me, fashion and art and music have always been a form of armor. I just kept creating more and more fantasies to escape into, new skins to shed. And every time I shed a skin, it was like taking a shower when you‚Äôre dirty: getting rid of, washing off, shedding all of the bad, and becoming something new.‚Äù I wonder aloud where all that began. ‚ÄúI just remember feeling so irritated at the thought that I had to conform to being ‚Äònormal,‚Äô or less of whatever I was already born as. And so I took such radical enjoyment in expressing who I am in the most grandiose of ways.‚Äù She laughs. ‚ÄúIt was sort of like a very polite ‚ÄòFuck off.‚Äô It was never about looking perfect‚Äîit was always about just being myself. And I think that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs always been about for my fans, too. It was a form of protection, and a secret‚Äîlike a wink from afar. I‚Äôm a monster, and you‚Äôre a monster too.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="563e89be-3846-4406-bc87-9744cb278dec">
    She locks the door, and as we head back out to the living room to say goodbye, she picks up a glass vase filled with fresh-cut roses from her garden and hands it to me: ‚ÄúJust a little something,‚Äù she says. For all of Lady Gaga‚Äôs histrionics and grandiosity and obfuscation and mucking around with monsters‚Äîand despite the fact that she claims to have ‚Äúconcrete in her veins‚Äù‚Äîmost people seem to get that she‚Äôs all heart. ‚ÄúI am not a brand,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI have my unique existence, just as everyone else does, and at the end of the day, it‚Äôs our humanity that connects us‚Äîour bodies and our biology. That‚Äôs what breeds compassion and empathy, and those are the things that I care the most about. Kindness!‚Äù She lets out a mordant chuckle. ‚ÄúIt can drive you mad. Someone very important in my life says to me often, ‚ÄòYou cannot stare at the carnage all day.‚Äô And I think... you have to stare at the carnage to an extent because if not, you‚Äôre being ignorant and complacent‚Äîto not view injustice and want to be a part of advocating for others. But...‚Äù She pauses for a long time. ‚ÄúOnce we just look each other in the eyes, if we can keep that contact, that contract, I think the world will be a better place.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="3674347a-a400-4eef-a840-455b20c2de81">
    Suddenly we both notice the sound of music wafting in from somewhere, as if someone opened a little girl‚Äôs jewelry box. It‚Äôs a Mister Softee truck.
   </p>
   <p key="fc6a42f3-e018-4943-a850-6d429885ef94">
    ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs down by the beach,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúbut can you believe that? The sound travels all the way up here.‚Äù
   </p>
   <p key="8ee16cb5-0e1c-4662-b1c1-6c73fe3d2dbd">
    The sound is a little creepy, I say.
   </p>
   <p key="c23ff788-0821-47d7-97c9-136ebe69ef92">
    ‚ÄúOr,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúit just sounds like kids having ice cream at the beach.‚Äù We both laugh. It reminds me of something we talked about earlier: that while Gaga‚Äôs music is often funny ‚Äîwith a wink or a bit of camp‚Äî she herself is a serious person. This has been a very serious conversation, I say. ‚ÄúYes, it has,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that funny?‚Äù.

     Interviewer: And here we are. Lady Gaga, how are you today?

     Lady Gaga:  Call me Lady.
     Interviewer: Okay Lady. What's something unreal that's happened this month?
     Lady Gaga: The trailer for A Star Is Born was released.
     Interviewer: Okay, and what's something you're proud to say is now behind you?
     Lady Gaga: You know, all the negative stuff that happens in your 20s.
     Interviewer: It's a colorful patio. How do you start your day?

     Interviewer:  Lady, how many times have you been on the cover of Vogue? Two times, three times?

     Lady Gaga: No it's not, it's actually been fantastic writing music.
     Interviewer: Do you have to be in love to write a good love song?
     Lady Gaga: I would say that it is good to be in love to write a love song or have.. to have been in love at one point, but it's also interesting, there's a lot of music in history that was written by people that have never been in love.
     Interviewer: Do the same rules apply for sad songs?
     Lady Gaga: No, I think, I think that there's no rules when it comes to making music.

     Lady Gaga: It was a milestone performance for me. I felt it really marked the decade of the first ten years of my career. And it felt like the fans performed the Super Bowl, not me. It was really for them.
     Interviewer: Now beyond the Super Bowl, what's a performance or a dream gig that you'd love to do?

     Lady Gaga: The number one look in my career I would say at the MTV Music Awards when I wore Alexander McQueen from his very last collection before he died.
     Interviewer: How much does a persona actually affect the musicality?
     Lady Gaga: I don't really know what people mean by "persona" when they bring that up with me. I just change as I make art, so the music affects my personality and vice versa.
     Interviewer: What is the first thing that you're drawn to in a look?
     Lady Gaga: I don't know, I have a very immediate emotional reaction to fashion.
     Interviewer: What excites you the most about fashion?

     Lady Gaga: Bradley Cooper is an incredible actor, incredible director, and absolutely incredible friend all the way around. I'm so excited for people to see his talent.
     Interviewer: What do you want your fans to take away from A Star Is Born?
     Lady Gaga: I want them to take away the beautiful love story, the undertones of family dynamic with alcoholism and codependency, and also that the movie is a very, very strong expression of what it means to become a star, and that she, myself, Ally, does not really become one until the last frame of the movie.
     Interviewer: Lady, do you consider yourself a feminist?
     Lady Gaga: Yes.
     Interviewer: What does feminism mean to you?
     Lady Gaga: I think feminism is the fight for women's rights, for equality, and also to protect women as much as possible within rape culture.
     Interviewer: What message do you wanna send to your young female fans?
     Lady Gaga: To my young female fans I would say, your body belongs to you, your mind belongs to you, your emotions belong to you, and just always be true to yourself and exercise what you want to be all the time and if you don't feel comfortable doing something then don't do it. Stay true to who you are.
     Interviewer: Do you think the way society views women is changing?
     Lady Gaga: I think it is changing. I think that society is having a more protected view of women in some ways. But I think on the political side we still have a long way to go.

      ‚ÄúSul set di House of Gucci pensavo ai miei antenati italiani‚Äù: Lady Gaga si racconta in un'intervista esclusiva a Vogue
     </b>
     In uno studio senza finestre a Chelsea, Manhattan, il marab√π rosa che decora un paio di stivaletti sembra fremere nell‚Äôattesa, fluttuando nell‚Äôaria prodotta da un ventilatore. ¬´Arriva fra dieci minuti¬ª, ci informa un bel ragazzo della sicurezza, facendo capolino dalla porta, mentre un esercito di assistenti si muove silenzioso in un abbagliante, favoloso ed effimero antro delle meraviglie couture.
     Appena arrivati dopo le sfilate di Parigi e Venezia, ci sono gli stender con gli abiti in seta ametista e fucsia di Valentino, i velluti nero inchiostro con dettagli in oro scintillante di Schiaparelli, gli austeri broccati Chanel, i candidi capi di maglia Louis Vuitton, i copricapo in metallo, pelle e piume, un centinaio di paia di scarpe con i tacchi di tutte le altezze, e una miriade di foulard, guanti e gioielli in ogni sfumatura di colore possibile e immaginabile. Noto anche delle ruches in stile elisabettiano. Ci troviamo qui per il fitting di Lady Gaga per lo shooting di Vogue. ¬´Facciamole subito indossare qualcosa di favoloso¬ª, dice Edward Enninful, direttore di Vogue UK e European Editorial Director di Vogue ‚Äì come se si potesse fare diversamente.
     Naturalmente i dieci minuti passano, ma alla fine, in un momento imprecisato (sono le tempistiche di una superstar), la porta finalmente si apre e appare una figura alta un metro e 55 con indosso un lungo abito estivo in maglia nera e scarpe con plateau in pelle nera dall‚Äôaltezza vertiginosa. √à sempre un‚Äôesperienza singolare incontrare una leggenda della pop culture che emana la sua vera quintessenza, e Lady Gaga non delude certo le aspettative. Le foto scattate qualche minuto fa, quando ha percorso il breve tratto fra l‚Äôautomobile e l‚Äôedificio, indossando le sue scarpe tacco 20 stanno gi√† facendo il giro del mondo. ¬´Oggi facciamo magia!¬ª, dice entrando, a mo‚Äô di saluto.
     Con i suoi tanti outfit spettacolari, 12 Grammy, un Oscar, e quella che √® forse l‚Äôascesa alla fama pi√π esplosiva del XXI secolo, Stefani Germanotta da pi√π di dieci anni a questa parte √® una delle persone pi√π famose del pianeta. E sa bene come giocarci, con questa fama. Prima si toglie gli occhiali da sole, poi ci butta le braccia abbronzate e tatuate al collo e ci stringe con affetto, e subito dopo si concentra su quello che c‚Äô√® da fare. ¬´Qualunque cosa indosser√≤¬ª, dice rivolta al team, con quella sua famosa parlata strascicata da nottambula, che √® sincerit√† con una spruzzata di frivolezza, ¬´quello che vi offro √® l‚Äôautentico glamour italiano che ho dentro¬ª.
     Ovviamente. La regina del pop, 35 anni, attrice gi√† nominata agli Oscar, apparir√† nel suo secondo film con il suo secondo ruolo da protagonista: House of Gucci, la pellicola di Ridley Scott che ha richiesto vent‚Äôanni di preparazione, e che racconta uno dei crimini pi√π famigerati del XX secolo. Dire che le aspettative sono alte non rende giustizia alla cosa. Gaga ‚Äì come sa chiunque sia stato su Internet negli ultimi sei mesi ‚Äì sar√† Patrizia Reggiani, socialite ed ex moglie di Maurizio Gucci che, nel 1998, √® stata condannata per aver assoldato il sicario che ha ucciso l‚Äôimprenditore in una mattina di primavera del 1995, mentre entrava nei suoi uffici a Milano.
     Un caso in cui era protagonista il denaro, tantissimo, e il peccato originale, un crimine che aveva scosso l‚ÄôItalia e il mondo intero, e che aveva avuto ripercussioni in tutta la fashion industry. Il trailer del film, che Lady Gaga ci mostra dal suo laptop, a pochi giorni dall‚Äôuscita in tutto il mondo (sar√† poi visto pi√π di 10 milioni di volte), ci d√† gi√† un‚Äôidea di quello che vedremo nel lungometraggio. ¬´Father, Son and House of Gucci¬ª, dice Gaga-Patrizia Reggiani, capelli castani super cotonati e sigaretta fra le dita, mentre si fa il segno della croce da un vestito a grandi pois rosa. L‚Äôattrice si rivede sul piccolo schermo del computer, godendosi gli urletti adoranti del team l√¨ riunito. ¬´Sono diversissima qui¬ª, dice, affascinata dalla sua stessa immagine.
     Qualche settimana pi√π tardi, le faccio una videochiamata a casa sua, sulla West Coast. Lei, che non perde mai occasione per assecondare il proprio mito, appare sul mio schermo, e sta cantando una canzone. ¬´Mi hai beccato a cantare!¬ª, dice, dopo aver finito un altro paio di battute di Night and Day di Cole Porter. √à difficile non lasciarsi conquistare dalla dedizione di una showgirl ‚Äì in particolare di una che se ne sta seduta nel suo grazioso ufficio rosa, con tanto di pianoforte e postazione beauty, la parete alle sue spalle interamente ricoperta di scarpe con tacco a stiletto. ¬´Be‚Äô, vedi, dovevo pur metterci qualcosa su queste pareti¬ª, esclama, sardonica.
     Indossa ¬´una T-shirt rosa antico¬ª ‚Äì e, facendo spallucce, dice di non ricordare il brand ‚Äì e un paio di leggings neri. ¬´Questa collana me l‚Äôha regalata il mio ragazzo, l‚Äôha presa in un bellissimo negozio di artigianato a San Francisco, come questi orecchini¬ª, spiega. Sua madre, Cynthia, viene pi√π tardi a prendere il t√®, e Lady Gaga √® in un mood rilassato da met√† pomeriggio. Ha lasciato fuori dal suo chignon due ciuffi di capelli castano miele, che adesso le incorniciano il volto perfettamente truccato, e il tutto enfatizza l‚Äôeffetto finale, una sorta di look da studentessa di recitazione. L‚Äôartista a riposo, se vogliamo. E ha senso. ¬´Ho iniziato a lavorarci tre anni fa¬ª, dice lanciandosi a parlare di House of Gucci, ¬´e sar√≤ completamente sincera e trasparente: ho vissuto come lei (come Reggiani, ndr) per un anno e mezzo. E ho parlato con il suo accento per nove mesi¬ª. Anche fuori dal set? ¬´Anche fuori dal set¬ª, conferma, con tono solenne. ¬´Non ho mai staccato. Sono stata sempre con lei¬ª.
     ¬´Era praticamente impossibile per me parlare come lei restando bionda¬ª, aggiunge. ¬´Ho dovuto subito tingermi i capelli, e ho cominciato a vivere in un modo per cui qualunque cosa vedessi, qualunque cosa toccassi, notavo dove e quando ci potessi vedere del denaro. E ho cominciato anche a fare foto. Non ho nessuna prova che Patrizia facesse foto, ma ho pensato che per esercitarmi, e per scoprire gli interessi che aveva nella vita, sarei diventata una fotografa, e cos√¨ ho iniziato a portare con me la mia fotocamera compatta ovunque andassi. Ho notato che Patrizia amava le cose belle. E se una foto non era bella, la cancellavo¬ª.
     La star dice che se la sua vita non avesse preso quella piega l√¨, fatta di abiti di carne e tourn√©e negli stadi, forse le sarebbe piaciuto fare la reporter, e infatti ha iniziato a mettere insieme i pezzi del personaggio con un approccio fra l‚Äôartistico e il giornalistico. Patrizia Reggiani, va detto, √® viva e vegeta, abita a Milano ed √® perfettamente in grado di parlare con la stampa. A quanto si dice √® contenta che sia un nome di cos√¨ grande spicco a prestarle il volto, anche se ‚Äì e qui la sua autocelebrazione non sembra offuscata dall‚Äôaver passato in carcere 18 dei 26 anni a cui era stata condannata come mandante dell‚Äôomicidio dell‚Äôex marito ‚Äì la scorsa estate ha dichiarato a una giornalista: ¬´Sono alquanto infastidita dal fatto che Lady Gaga mi stia interpretando nel nuovo film di Ridley Scott senza neppure avere avuto l‚Äôaccortezza e la sensibilit√† di venire a incontrarmi¬ª.
     Quindi non l‚Äôhai mai incontrata? chiedo a Gaga. ¬´Sai¬ª, risponde, ¬´ho pensato che avrei potuto rendere giustizia a questa vicenda solo se mi ci fossi avvicinata con gli occhi di una donna curiosa, con uno spirito giornalistico, per poter leggere fra le righe di quello che accadeva nelle scene del film¬ª. Sembra tenerci molto a essere estremamente chiara. ¬´E questo significa che nessuno mi avrebbe dovuto dire chi era Patrizia Gucci¬ª, dice, in tono piatto. ¬´Nemmeno Patrizia Gucci¬ª.
     La pellicola resta ancora avvolta nel mistero, e la cosa √® piuttosto inusuale, visto che sta per uscire. Al momento dell‚Äôintervista con Lady Gaga, Ridley Scott non ha ancora permesso neppure a lei di vederne delle parti, e lei, che afferma di fidarsi di lui totalmente, per ‚Äúrispetto‚Äù non vuole rivelare troppo. Nonostante ci√≤, facendo un po‚Äô di moine riesco a capire che il film probabilmente parte all‚Äôinizio degli anni 70, quando Patrizia (cresciuta in povert√† a Vignola, in Emilia Romagna, e la cui sorte era cambiata grazie al denaro del nuovo patrigno che lavorava nel settore degli autotrasporti) conosce Maurizio Gucci frequentando la vita notturna milanese.
     Spinta dalla madre, Silvana Barbieri, Reggiani √® a caccia di un marito, e Maurizio ha tutte le carte in regola: ricchezza, bellezza, e un nome. (¬´Si innamor√≤ follemente di me¬ª, ha dichiarato Reggiani. ¬´Ero eccitante, e diversa¬ª). √à stata una storia molto passionale, senza dubbio. ¬´Anche lei lo amava¬ª, dice Gaga. E anche se il padre di Maurizio, Rodolfo ‚Äì il figlio del fondatore dell‚Äôazienda, Guccio Gucci ‚Äì nutriva pi√π di un dubbio sul passato un po‚Äô ambiguo della Reggiani, i due si sposarono nel 1972. (La sposa era in Gucci, naturalmente, un abito accollato a maniche lunghe che, per quello che siamo riusciti a capire dagli scatti rubati dai paparazzi sul set del film, sembra essere stato modificato e reso un po‚Äô pi√π sexy per Lady Gaga).
     Durante gli anni 70 e all‚Äôinizio degli ‚Äô80, i giovani Gucci erano una coppia di neosposi belli, carismatici e alla deriva in un mare di lusso. Due figlie bellissime, uno yacht maestoso (il fatale tre alberi Cr√©ole) e la presenza fissa nella guest list dello Studio 54, la loro era una vita vissuta sul filo del rasoio del glamour. Oltre all‚Äôattico all‚ÄôOlympic Tower a New York, la villa ad Acapulco, lo chalet a Sankt Moritz e la fattoria nel Connecticut, c‚Äôera la passione di Patrizia per le orchidee (una mania da novemila euro al mese), l‚Äôamicizia con Jackie Kennedy, la sua collezione di gioielli multimilionaria, e poi le feste, i palazzi e le macchine di lusso con le targhe personalizzate con la scritta ‚Äúmauizia‚Äù (in quanto a nomi composti, la coppia era avanti anni luce rispetto a Brangelina).
     Nel 1983, per√≤, il sogno cominci√≤ a vacillare. Dopo la morte di Rodolfo, Maurizio, suo unico figlio, assunse il controllo totale sul suo 50 per cento dell‚Äôazienda (il resto era di propriet√† del fratello di Rodolfo, Aldo), e in famiglia ebbe inizio una guerra senza riserve. Reggiani, che in quel momento si percepiva pi√π Gucci dei Gucci, era ai ferri corti con il marito tanto quanto lo era con i cugini di lui, e con il passare degli anni il matrimonio and√≤ in pezzi: lui la lasci√≤ nel 1985. Lei non la prese molto bene: quando Maurizio inizi√≤ a non rispondere pi√π alle sue telefonate, lei registrava cassette in cui lo insultava con violenza, e poi gliele faceva consegnare da un corriere nel suo appartamento di corso Venezia.
     La situazione in azienda non era certo pi√π rosea. Era il periodo del famoso e imperfetto modello di licensing Gucci, per cui la produzione di qualunque oggetto, dalle mazze da golf ai canovacci, veniva appaltata ad aziende terze solo per fare un mucchio di soldi. Maurizio era invece deciso a riprendere il controllo, a riportare in auge la qualit√† impareggiabile degli articoli di pelletteria su cui la famiglia aveva in origine costruito la sua fortuna, e si mise a cercare nuovi investimenti. Ma fra le liti con Aldo (che poi fu arrestato per frode fiscale) e quelle con i cugini, la fama di una maison un tempo grandissima si appann√≤ fino ad affondare pericolosamente.
     Al di l√† della sua evidente ambizione, i piani di Maurizio furono la causa stessa della sua rovina. Non era in grado di guadagnare abbastanza denaro per coprire le sue spese stravaganti, e nel 1993 cedette tutta la sua quota alla Investcorp per 120 milioni di dollari, ponendo fine di fatto a pi√π di 70 anni di propriet√† del marchio da parte della famiglia Gucci. Patrizia, che nonostante gli eventi drammatici era rimasta sempre in prima linea, oltre a essere legalmente ancora sua moglie, si accese di rabbia, come ebbe a dire lei stessa. A peggiorare le cose era stato anche il fatto che, tre anni prima, Maurizio aveva iniziato una relazione con l‚Äôex modella e poi interior designer Paola Franchi, un‚Äôamica d‚Äôinfanzia che aveva anche presenziato al matrimonio con Patrizia. L‚Äôombra del divorzio incombeva, e suo marito, il suo nome, la sua ricchezza, il suo status ‚Äì la sua stessa identit√† ‚Äì tutto precipitava. Una situazione esplosiva.
     Lady Gaga √® stata conquistata da questa vicenda ‚Äì ¬´Mi affascinava il percorso di questa donna¬ª ‚Äì e ha passato pi√π di un anno a studiare articoli di giornali e registrazioni di Reggiani, anche se, cosa significativa, non ha mai letto La saga dei Gucci. Una storia avvincente di creativit√†, fascino, successo, follia, di Sara Gay Forden, il libro del 2000 su cui √® basato il film. ¬´Non volevo sentire nessuna opinione che potesse influenzare in alcun modo il mio pensiero¬ª. Scott le aveva mandato la sceneggiatura poco dopo l‚Äôuscita di A Star Is Born, la sua entrata trionfale a Hollywood con un ruolo da protagonista, nel 2018. Insieme alla moglie e socia produttrice, Giannina Facio, Scott aveva iniziato un lungo e difficile percorso per questo progetto, che ha visto susseguirsi diversi nomi, oltre al suo, alla regia, e con Angelina Jolie, Pen√©lope Cruz e Margot Robbie come papabili per il ruolo di Patrizia Reggiani. Ma le stelle alla fine si sono allineate per Gaga: ¬´Come potrei non interpretare una stronza cos√¨, grintosa, sexy, sconsiderata e audace?¬ª, ricorda di aver pensato in quel momento. ¬´Una cacciatrice di dote, italiana, e ribelle?¬ª.
     Quando i produttori del film si accordarono su un‚Äôidea in apparenza un po‚Äô r√©tro, e cio√® che il cast recitasse in inglese, ma con un forte accento italiano, lei intu√¨ che era essenziale indovinare la voce di Reggiani. E si √® messa a lavorare d‚Äôimpegno. ¬´Ho iniziato con un dialetto particolare che si parla a Vignola, poi ho lavorato sul modo di parlare delle classi sociali pi√π alte, che sarebbe stato pi√π appropriato in posti come Milano e Firenze¬ª, spiega. ¬´Nel film noterai che il mio accento √® leggermente diverso a seconda della persona con cui sto parlando¬ª. Il trailer ha destato qualche perplessit√† in Italia, la preoccupazione √® che si tratti dell‚Äôennesimo gruppo di attori americani che parla in inglese ‚Äúbroccolino‚Äù. Lady Gaga, fra gli italoamericani pi√π famosi negli Usa, √® molto sensibile sull‚Äôargomento. ¬´Fare questo film √® stata l‚Äôesperienza di una vita, perch√© ogni minuto, ogni giorno pensavo ai miei antenati in Italia, e quello che hanno dovuto fare per darmi una vita migliore. Volevo che fossero orgogliosi, e per questo motivo ho scelto di interpretare una donna vera, non l‚Äôidea di una donna cattiva¬ª.
     E cos√¨ √® entrata nella mente di un‚Äôassassina. I Gucci alla fine divorziarono nel 1994, e mentre Maurizio progettava di sposare Franchi, cosa che lo avrebbe portato a dimezzare gli alimenti a Reggiani, fino a diventare quello che lei aveva definito ‚Äúun piatto di lenticchie‚Äù (860.000 dollari l‚Äôanno), lei registra insulti sempre pi√π instabili e minacciosi. In uno, poi ascoltato anche in tribunale, infierisce: ¬´L‚Äôinferno per te deve ancora venire¬ª. Presto chiese aiuto alla sua migliore amica, Pina Auriemma, una chiaroveggente napoletana, che a sua volta assunse il sicario, Benedetto Ceraulo, proprietario di una pizzeria con problemi finanziari. Alle 8.30 di una limpida mattina di fine marzo del 1995, Ceraulo esegu√¨ l‚Äôordine di Patrizia Reggiani: uccidere il padre delle sue figlie. Maurizio Gucci aveva 46 anni. Reggiani √® stata condannata tre anni dopo e poi rilasciata sulla parola nel 2016. Le figlie di Gucci, Alessandra e Allegra, in principio sostennero la madre, pensando che il suo comportamento fosse dovuto al tumore benigno al cervello che un intervento aveva poi rimosso. Dopo molti anni, pare che non si parlino pi√π.
     ‚ÄúSono tante le cose da elaborare, vero, Gaga?‚Äù, le chiedo. Tutto questo sfarzo, tutta questa tristezza. Non era in ansia al pensiero di esserne coinvolta? Come al solito, lei doveva trovare la missione insita nel progetto. Uno scopo. ¬´Non voglio celebrare una persona capace di commettere un omicidio¬ª, dice. ¬´Ma desidero rendere omaggio alle donne che nel corso della storia hanno imparato a sopravvivere, e alle conseguenze pi√π spiacevoli della sofferenza. Spero che le donne guardino il film, e che riflettano sul fatto che le persone ferite poi a loro volta feriscono gli altri. E questo √® pericoloso. Cosa pu√≤ succedere a una persona¬ª, si domanda, ¬´quando viene portata al limite?¬ª.
     Sembra che il film sia riuscito a dare una risposta a questa domanda. Le riprese principali sono iniziate nel febbraio di quest‚Äôanno a Roma, con gli uomini della famiglia Gucci interpretati da un cast che include Adam Driver nei panni di Maurizio, Jeremy Irons in quelli di Rodolfo, Al Pacino nel ruolo dello zio Aldo e Jared Leto in quello del cugino Paolo. Con l‚ÄôItalia bloccata dal lockdown, e con i paparazzi ovunque, Gaga, sotto l‚Äôinflusso della tecnica di Susan Batson (la sua insegnante di recitazione, che era presente sul set e che ha studiato a sua volta con Lee Strasberg), dice di essere andata cos√¨ a fondo nel personaggio da aver cominciato a perdere il contatto con la realt√†. ¬´Ho avuto qualche difficolt√† psicologica a un certo punto, verso la fine delle riprese¬ª, spiega, pesando bene le parole. ¬´Che fossi nella mia stanza d‚Äôalbergo, oppure sul set, vivevo e parlavo come lei. Ricordo che un giorno, in Italia, mi sono messa un cappello e sono uscita a fare una passeggiata. Non lo facevo da pi√π o meno due mesi, e sono andata nel panico¬ª. Non riusciva pi√π a riconoscere il mondo reale. ¬´Pensavo di essere sul set di un film¬ª.
     ¬´Follia e delizia¬ª, √® cos√¨ che Salma Hayek, che nel film interpreta Pina Auriemma, mi descrive il metodo di lavoro di Gaga. ¬´√à molto glamorous¬ª, dice del film l‚Äôattrice di origine messicana, ¬´molto fastoso, e pochissime volte ho visto un attore lavorare con cos√¨ tanta passione¬ª, racconta, molto colpita. ¬´Si √® impegnata totalmente¬ª. √à stato difficile lavorarci? ¬´Non √® stata proprio un‚Äôagonia, eh!¬ª, risponde, ironica, e poi ride. ¬´Era qualcosa di affascinante. Era magica. Un genio¬ª.
     Gaga √® pi√π schiva. ¬´Una volta, tra una ripresa e l‚Äôaltra, Salma fa: ‚ÄúOh, questo ca**o di metodo Stanislavskij, eccolo qui. Vedi, adesso non mi parla proprio‚Äù. Io stavo facendo un lavoro sulla memoria sensoriale, ero accanto a lei, e lei mi prendeva in giro mentre ero seduta l√¨ a fare questa cosa. E non ho nemmeno riso. Quando la scena √® finita, le ho mostrato il dito medio e le ho detto: ‚ÄúSei ridicola!‚Äù, sono scoppiata a ridere e le ho dato un bacio. √à stato un set meraviglioso, ma quando lavoro sono molto seria¬ª.
     Sta davvero ridacchiando, adesso che ci ripensa. Non per rovinare l‚Äôatmosfera idilliaca, dico, ma non deve essere stato facile per la sua famiglia ‚Äúperderla‚Äù per cos√¨ tanto tempo. Per vedere la loro figlia, sorella, fidanzata trasformarsi per mesi in una socialite omicida milanese. Annuisce lentamente. ¬´Non ci siamo sentiti e siamo rimasti distanti per un po‚Äô¬ª, conferma.
     Mi dice anche di aver perso l‚Äôaccento subito dopo la fine delle riprese, mentre altri particolari le sono rimasti addosso. ¬´Finisci per avere la sua stessa voce, per assomigliarle, s√¨, ma non √® un‚Äôimitazione, √® un divenire. Ricordo che quando abbiamo iniziato le riprese, sapevo di essere diventata lei ‚Äì e sapevo che la sfida pi√π grande sarebbe stata tornare a essere me stessa¬ª. Sente il peso di questo ruolo intensamente. ¬´Questo √® il mio viaggio come artista con cui faccio ancora i conti, e mi domando se sia sano il modo in cui lo faccio¬ª. Scrolla le spalle: rassegnata, consapevole, forse anche un po‚Äô orgogliosa. ¬´Semplicemente, √® l‚Äôunico modo che conosco¬ª.
     E a questo punto diventa riflessiva. ¬´Beh, ho 35 anni¬ª, dice ridendo. ¬´Della serie, Lady Gaga ha 35 anni! Mi sento vecchia!¬ª. Ma mai troppo vecchia per un fantastico press tour. In puro brio hollywoodiano, quelle per promuovere A Star Is Born sono state forse le migliori apparizioni sul red carpet degli ultimi anni (tutto quel faille di seta pervinca‚Ä¶), ed √® pronta a ricominciare. ¬´Amo moltissimo vedere tutte quelle persone¬ª, dice. ¬´Mi piace davvero tanto il fatto che il pubblico mi adori ormai da quasi vent‚Äôanni. Che io canti, reciti o sfili su un tappeto rosso, amo far sorridere il pubblico¬ª.
     Di sicuro Gaga non ha smarrito quel suo mix inebriante di sincerit√† e ‚Äúcamp‚Äù: ¬´Anche se l‚Äôet√† √® solo un numero, quello che sento pi√π di ogni altra cosa √® un grande affetto per la comunit√† artistica, per il collettivo artistico¬ª, afferma, e mi dice anche che devo recapitare ‚Äúal mondo‚Äù questo suo messaggio. A gennaio ha cantato alla cerimonia di insediamento di Joe Biden. ¬´Uno dei giorni in cui mi sono sentita pi√π orgogliosa in tutta la mia vita. Come tanti in America, ero molto spaventata quando Trump era presidente, l‚Äôuscita del 45¬∞ presidente e l‚Äôarrivo del 46¬∞ √® stata una cosa straordinaria, una cosa che potr√≤ raccontare ai miei figli¬ª. Sorride. ¬´Cantare con un vestito antiproiettile di Schiaparelli. Non so se le persone sanno questo di me, ma se non fossi quello che sono oggi, sarei diventata una reporter di guerra. Era uno dei miei sogni. Quando ero a Capitol Hill, il giorno prima dell‚Äôinsediamento, ricordo di aver camminato un po‚Äô l√¨ intorno per cercare le prove della rivolta¬ª.
     Ora si sente di nuovo felice, anche se questa sensazione le √® stata spesso sconosciuta. ¬´Per molto tempo ho pensato che non sarei riuscita a superare il fatto di essere diventata famosa cos√¨ giovane, e tutte le conseguenze sulla mia mente. Ma ora sono pronta a dichiararmi guarita. Non saremo mai tutti del tutto sani¬ª, si corregge, ¬´ma di sicuro ci basta. Sono molto riconoscente per la felicit√† che provo¬ª. √à una sensazione nuova? ¬´√à una cosa piuttosto recente, s√¨. Direi di questi ultimi due anni¬ª. Gaga, la newyorkese par excellence, ora passa gran parte del tempo a Hollywood, con il fidanzato Michael Polansky, studi a Harvard e direttore esecutivo dell‚Äôorganizzazione filantropica Parker Foundation, che si occupa di scienza, salute pubblica e arte. Stravede per i suoi cani, dice che ora stanno bene dopo la serie di eventi sconvolgenti accaduti all‚Äôinizio di quest‚Äôanno: il rapimento, e il ferimento del dogsitter (per fortuna senza gravi conseguenze). ¬´S√¨, stanno bene¬ª, dice, comprensibilmente ancora scossa. ¬´Grazie a Dio¬ª.
     La tabella di marcia della pop star e stella del cinema resta bella piena. Oltre al film su Gucci, in quest‚Äôultimo anno ha interpretato i classici del jazz con Tony Bennett al Radio City Music Hall e ha pubblicato Love for Sale, il loro secondo album di duetti di Cole Porter, che ha avuto recensioni straordinarie. Dirige la sua Born This Way Foundation, la cui missione √® prendersi cura dell‚Äôequilibrio psicologico dei giovani e dar loro gli strumenti per costruire un mondo migliore, ed √® presissima da Haus Laboratories, la sua linea di make-up vegano dalle graziose palette e dall‚Äôamatissimo eyeliner liquido, che rende pi√π di 140 milioni di dollari l‚Äôanno.
     Poi, ovviamente, c‚Äô√® stato Chromatica, il suo fantastico album elettronico, un successo strepitoso, uscito nel 2020. Sono seguiti alcuni remix all‚Äôinizio di quest‚Äôanno ‚Äì Dawn of Chromatica ‚Äì e sta pensando a una tourn√©e post-pandemia. Naturalmente, come parte del segmento demografico principale tra i fan di Chromatica, la riempio di complimenti, le faccio capire quanto sia stato importante per me quel disco durante il lockdown, e lei accenna un sorriso prima di dirmi: ¬´Non credo di aver mai sofferto tanto nella mia vita come quando ho fatto quel disco. √à molto difficile per me ascoltarlo. Ed √® molto difficile per me anche cantare quelle canzoni, ma non perch√© non siano stupende o meravigliose ma perch√© venivano da un buco nero, nerissimo, nel mio cuore¬ª.
     Che tipo di situazione viveva durante la registrazione del disco? ¬´Non volevo pi√π essere me¬ª, dice semplicemente. ¬´Non avevo pi√π la capacit√† di capire cosa ero in grado di fare come persona. Sentivo di non valere quasi nulla. Ma ce l‚Äôho fatta ugualmente. Ho detto a un amico l‚Äôaltro giorno: ogni volta che vivo dei momenti difficili, mi ripeto sempre, ridendo: lo so, √® dura. Ma √® molto pi√π dura quando vuoi farla finita ogni giorno. Quindi prometto di parlare sempre di equilibrio psicologico, di gentilezza, compassione e validazione. Credo sinceramente che l‚Äôuniverso mi abbia fatto vivere tutto questo perch√© fossi pronta a parlarne con il mondo¬ª. Per un momento, l‚Äôesibizione della fama si interrompe. ¬´So che non √® ‚Äúil mondo‚Äù. Non √® che il mondo intero sappia cosa faccio, e non √® questo il punto. √à chiunque stia ascoltando. A chiunque stia ascoltando: ti voglio bene, e se stai soffrendo, ti assicuro che andr√† meglio¬ª.
     La sua mente, per√≤, ritorna presto sul mondo di Gucci. ¬´Questa era un‚Äôaltra cosa che mi interessava: chi ha ucciso Maurizio, cio√®, lei chi aveva ingaggiato?¬ª, si chiede, e ne √® ancora affascinata. ¬´Sono convinta che in realt√† non abbia detto la verit√† su questo aspetto¬ª. Gaga guardava le interviste su YouTube, e mormorava: ¬´Stai mentendo¬ª. ¬´In un‚Äôintervista, Reggiani ha detto che erano stati quelli della ‚Äúbanda Bassotti‚Äù, e credo volesse dire qualcuno della mafia. Mi sono chiesta per un attimo se sia stata la camorra. Quindi mentre si girava ho deciso, ancora una volta segretamente, quello a cui volevo credere¬ª.
     Pensa che verr√† un momento, una volta uscito il film, una volta superata l‚Äôintensit√† di tutto questo, in cui potrebbe voler incontrare Reggiani, chiedo. Per lo meno, la curiosit√† non potrebbe avere la meglio su di lei? Segue una pausa densa di significato. ¬´Non ne sono del tutto convinta. Penso sia necessario un certo quoziente emotivo per fare l‚Äôattore¬ª, dice, cercando di spiegare la sua reticenza. Il film l‚Äôha anche trascinata in fondo a un‚Äôoscurit√† che ora √® pronta a scrollarsi di dosso. ¬´Il modo in cui mi sono sentita mentre interpretavo questo ruolo... alla fine, mi sono resa conto che quando uccidi qualcuno, in realt√† uccidi te stesso¬ª. Poi smette di parlare, e per un attimo sembra perdersi di nuovo in tutto quello che ha vissuto. Lentamente, sbatte le palpebre pi√π volte, tornando alla realt√† di Gaga, lontana da quella di Patrizia. ¬´Le persone a cui ho tenuto di pi√π in tutto questo percorso sono le sue figlie¬ª, dice, misurando le parole, ¬´e a loro mando amore e compassione, perch√© sono certa che l‚Äôuscita di questo film potrebbe rivelarsi molto difficile e dolorosa per loro. E non desidero altro che pace per i loro cuori¬ª. I suoi occhi sono di nuovo pieni di apprensione. E poi di speranza. ¬´Ho fatto del mio meglio per interpretare la verit√†¬ª.
