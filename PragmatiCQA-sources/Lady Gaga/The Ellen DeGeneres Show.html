    I was like, 'can she please change because this is going to be very awkward and this is a daytime show.' It's not the VMA's. She's going to show up this and then it's going to air tomorrow during daytime and then she's sitting, ya know, on my show in a meat dress and it's going to be weird for her. Whether your vegan or not, it's just weird siting next to somebody wearing slabs of meat on their head and their body. It's gross, you know. Even if you eat meat, it's gross.

    Now, I love Lady Gaga but as someone who also loves animals, it was really difficult for me to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit. But it did make me ask myself, what's the difference between her outfit and an outfit made of leather?

       Well, it is certainly no disrespect to anyone that is vegan or vegetarian. As you know, I am the most judgement-free human being on the earth. However, it has many interpretations. For me this evening, if we don’t stand up for what we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon, we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on own bones. And, I am not a piece of meat.

     Lady Gaga: You're so kind.
     Ellen DeGeneres: No. I mean, I-- Portia couldn't go that night when I went to the screening. And I came home and I was like, not only is the movie great, your, obviously, singing is great, but your acting is so natural and effortless. And it almost looked like there was no script. It looked like you were just having a conversation, and there couldn't have been more-- like no take was the same. That's how it felt.
     Lady Gaga: You know, that is 100% testament to Bradley as an incredible filmmaker, an incredible director. An incredible singer, I'm sure you can all agree.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah.
     [AUDIENCE CLAPPING]
     Ellen DeGeneres: He has a great voice.
     Lady Gaga: Beautiful voice. And, you know, he just provided for such a sanctuary on set, and it was, you know-- he says that to me in the film, and he said it to me in real life 'All you have to do is trust me'. And, you know, I really felt like I could trust him every day on set, and it was just-- it was thrilling. It was a totally different experience than I've ever had.
     Ellen DeGeneres: There are a lot of people in this town that have the same career. Actors, actresses, whatever. And especially when the woman is more successful than the man, if that is the case, it is a tricky situation to have a relationship. You know? It just is.
     Lady Gaga: Absolutely. And the film addresses that. And, you know, it addresses substance abuse, and mental health, and codependency. It operates on many levels. And having a voice, and what to do with it, and what you want to say in the world. And I just want to say to you, at the end of your shows when you talk about being kind, you know, that is just the most important thing that anyone could say that has a voice in this world. And so thank you so much for doing that.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Thank you.
     [AUDIENCE CLAPPING]
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah. I'm lucky I have a platform to do that.
     Lady Gaga: You are.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah.
     Lady Gaga: You are. And you use it. And you use it.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah. It's the most important thing, when we have a platform, is to do something where we know we're helping somebody else.

     Ellen DeGeneres: Now, when you finish the character, shooting the movie, was that character hard to let go of?
     Lady Gaga: Yes. And I literally dyed my hair blonde the night that we stopped shooting, because I wanted to get out of it as soon as possible, because there is-- without giving away the end of the film, there is some tremendous emotion and tragedy. So I wanted to get her out, but, you know, she-- to be honest, she's, she's still in here.
     Ellen DeGeneres: She's still there?
     Lady Gaga: Yeah. For sure.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah, but some of it is a good thing that she's there, right?
     Lady Gaga: You know, I think, I think-- passion, and fighting to be who you are, I think these are two of the most important things in the world.
     [AUDIENCE CLAPPING]
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah. Yeah, it is. I'm so happy to see you again. We're going to take a break. We're going to play a game after this, but first, the name of the CD. And the music is great. It's called "A Star is Born." Everybody in the audience is going home with a copy of--

     Ellen DeGeneres: I mean, you just, you just hear Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and just that alone is going to draw people, much less the movie. The movie has been remade four times, right?
     Lady Gaga: Yeah.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Had you seen all of them?
     Lady Gaga: Yes.
     Ellen DeGeneres: You had.
     Lady Gaga: Yes.
     Ellen DeGeneres: So you were a fan anyway.
     Lady Gaga: Yes. But I did my research also, after I was cast for the role, because there was an original-- the original had no music in it. And that's with Janet Gaynor. And then the second was Judy Garland. It had music in it. And obviously, the one with Barbra Streisand had it as well.
     Ellen DeGeneres: So the first one didn't have music in it. Was she an actress? Or she was a singer? And--
     Lady Gaga: She was an actress, yes.
     Ellen DeGeneres: OK, so it was a different story. And then you get cast in this. And you must be like, you know, beyond excited because this is a movie that you already loved.
     Lady Gaga: Well, I was just, you know, extremely humbled by the experience of meeting Bradley and him coming to my home. And you know, he makes you feel comfortable right away. And he's just such a loving and caring person. And we're both from the East Coast, and we're both Italian. So you know, before I knew it, I was heating up leftovers in the kitchen and feeding him. And we were talking about life. And then we started to sing together at the piano, a song by Creedence Clearwater Revival, "Midnight Special." And I heard his voice, and I stopped dead in my tracks. And I said, oh, my gosh, Bradley. You can sing. Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah. He sings from his soul. I mean, am I--
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah, he has a great voice.
     [APPLAUSE, CHEERING]
     Ellen DeGeneres: He didn't think he did. He thought he couldn't sing.
     Lady Gaga: Well, he was wrong.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yeah, I know.
     Lady Gaga: He was wrong. He can sing. And you know what? He's a great songwriter. He wrote on all his songs for this film.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Really?
     Lady Gaga: Yes. And some of them that we do together, we did with other people.
     Ellen DeGeneres: It was just-- it was just amazing to hear you sing, because I love your voice anyway. And then the two of you together onstage was just-- it was, it was incredible.
     Lady Gaga: Thank you.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Just incredible. Now, you didn't wear much makeup, if any at all in this. Was that freeing for you? Were you self-conscious about it?
     Lady Gaga: It was freeing, then terrifying, freeing, then terrifying. And you know what? It was perfect for the character. You know? It's exactly who Ally is. And in many ways, it was wonderful for me because I got to experience a real challenge with this role. Because in a lot of ways, Ally and I are nothing alike.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Really?
     Lady Gaga: Yes.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Because I thought-- I thought that really was, just stripped down, that we don't get to see often enough. But I felt like that was you.
     Lady Gaga: Well, you know, when I
     started my career, I-- I mean, I decided around 19 years old that I was going to go for it as a singer because, like, I couldn't get any jobs as an actress. And you know, I just hit the pavement running. And I was dragging my piano around New York City, banging on doors, you know.
     Ellen DeGeneres: That's heavy.
     Lady Gaga: Pretending, pretending--
     [LAUGHTER]
     Ellen DeGeneres: To bring a piano with you.
     Lady Gaga: A keyboard.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Oh, OK, all right.
     Lady Gaga: A keyboard. And still heavy, very heavy. And I would call up, and know I'd be like, (BRITISH ACCENT) hello, this is a Lady Gaga's manager. And she's really hot right now. And we would like the 10:00 PM slot for her. She-- she-- you know, if you can fit her in. And I used it just, like, I pretend that I was my own manager and try to get the best gig that I could. And Ally is completely different. I mean, she's in her 30s. She's completely given up on herself. She doesn't believe that she can make it. She doesn't believe she's beautiful. She's completely insecure about her looks. And she's jaded by the industry. And so that was the major difference.
     Ellen DeGeneres: Yes.

     Lady Gaga: All right.

     [CROWD CHEERS WILDLY]
     Lady Gaga: You know, the reward for me is all in the work. And the reward for me is all in just it being something that moves you. That's what's most important to me.
