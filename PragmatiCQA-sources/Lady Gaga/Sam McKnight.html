      She is great. Her energy and passion for her art is unmatched. She is also just so nice. We met on set for Vogue, then I introduced her to Nick Knight as I thought she would get on really well. We went on to work on music videos like Born This Way, I put black grease on her hair and she became her alter-ego Jo Calderone. I put the meat on her head for the VMAs, I got the steaks delivered… and they were pinned to a wig. They matched the dress!

     The idea was really to Vogue her up - keeping the essence of Lady Gaga, but adding an element of sophistication. I brought along a selection of wigs and [fashion director] Kate Phelan, [photographer] Josh Olins and I chose one that I had cut and curled to be a cross between Marilyn Monroe and Madonna in her 'Sex' book era. She's such a magnificent blonde bombshell that it seemed right to play on that - but having said that, we thought about putting her in a pink wig too. She's got the kind of look that can take any hair colour and I'm sure we'll see her going for dramatic dye-jobs throughout her career.   She loved, loved, loved the wig and asked if she could buy it, so we ended up doing a swap for tickets to one of her gigs. I saw that she wore it out to a gig the very next night and she looked fabulous.   What's so refreshing is that she's obsessed with fashion, but in a really positive, effusive way. She got all the references, she knew who everyone was, she trusted the team and encouraged us to go crazy and make her look really different, which was a dream for us.

     I prep all of the wigs beforehand—all of the coloring, curling, styling on the wig are done in advance. On set, we applied the wig first, which came to about her mid-shoulder; then the extensions were added that went beyond the bust-line to cover her boobs. We were into making her look sensuous and gorgeous. And I brought two wigs with me, a pale lilac and pale pink, both with grayish undertones.
