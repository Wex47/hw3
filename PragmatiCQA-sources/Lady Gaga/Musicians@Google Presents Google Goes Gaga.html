And more than a quarter million votes, in just three and a half days. We have questions that are both in text and video. I wrote the top 20 questions here. We’re going to go through those and also do some –

      Question from the Video

     : Hi, Gaga. My first question that I wanted to ask was, how are you? I remember in one of your interviews you said that that was a question that interviewers never really asked you and actually meant it. And so I wanted to ask you and actually mean it. So how are you?

      Lady Gaga

     : Awwww. Well, I am absolutely wonderful and a little bit choked up, because that is why I am still here and why I work so hard, it’s because I really am very blessed to have fans with such a beautiful spirit. And I’m sure you can see just from that one video very much what a lot of my day is like. I do spend a lot of time on Google, looking for fan videos and messages. And I’m doing wonderful today. And I would say that the only reason I ever mentioned that people don’t ask me how I am genuinely is because it took a lot of bravery to get to where we are today. A lot of people see glasses and shoulderpads and crazy outfits, and over the years, it was very difficult to do interviews, because that’s all people would talk about. So I guess what I would say is I’m doing wonderful now because of how brave that — all my fans have made me. So thank you for making me brave, and I hope I can — thank you brave. Thank you.

      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : I don’t like surprises, and I don’t like pranks. I’m sure you can maybe tell that just from — but I don’t like pranks. But I actually, with me, have brought all my friends from New York City on tour with me. So I have had very few, I should say, famous acts opening. It’s been mostly really underground bands and deejays that I’ve known since I was 18 years old. So there’s a lot of backstage shenanigans. Very often they make jokes about my diet, because they know I have to stay fit for music videos, so they’ll leave like mounds of cheese burgers and stuff in my dressing room. It’s really awful. Vicious, vicious.

      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : And I’ll never forget it. But it’s a very different — it’s funny, it’s almost more enjoyable now when I hear it for the first time on the radio, because at the time in Canada, I had — I mean, many people don’t know this about me, because it seems as though one just stands at number one, it was this big massive oh, she became a star overnight. But to tell you the truth, I had been working so hard, doing three shows a night, all day long going to radio stations, doing photos — the reason we’re here at Google today is because the original campaign for my music and my project began with online media-based advertisements. So that’s really where I began. So I remember I was in Canada, and I was really tired, and I was about to go on stage at this outdoor performance – I actually think it was in Winnipeg, which is where Maria Aragon is from, from the video. And I remember I heard it, and I started crying. And my tour manager, David, said, “How does it feel?” And I said, “It’s about damn time!”

     : — where I’m going to be. And so everyone was saying, they know we were going to be there, just don’t tell them when. And, oh, my gosh, my security is always — they want to shoot me, because I will literally leave the house and go to the bodega down the street where I live in New York. And they’re like, “Where are you?” Because where I live, I have been hustling for so long that it’s more just like, “You’re home.” Like, everybody’s so cool. And I guess even though my first album was called The Fame, that was never the ultimate goal of any of this. It was always that I just really am genuinely a musician to my core, and a lot of people don’t know that about me. But I write every lyric, every melody, I’m in there with the producers, whipping them to make the new future of music. And I — that is why I’m here. I’m not here to be a superstar. But — So, yes and no. I never, ever — there was never a day when I woke up and said, “I’m a superstar.” I’m still waiting for that to happen.

     : I wouldn’t say apologize. There’s been lots of concert ticket requests. And I think one of the most awkward things that anyone ever said to me was, “Well, my, my how the tables have turned.” But to be honest, I don’t have that kind of vengeful spirit in myself, and I never did. It was just more that, you know, I say this with so much genuineness from my heart, is that bullying really stays with you your whole life. And it really, really never goes away. And I know you’re using words like superstar, and most Googled and billions of YouTube videos. But I was never the winner. I was always the loser. And that still stays with me. And do I want to stick it to anybody? No. I just want to make music. So --

But I also see something afraid, something that I was, something that was unsure. And I really encourage people to look into the darkness and look into places that you would not normally look to find uniqueness and specialness, because that’s where the diamonds are hiding.

     : What a cutie. I love my fans. Yes, I actually vocally rehearse every single day. I do a 30-minute warmup every single day. It’s been the same vocal warmup that I’ve been doing since I was 11 years old. I have my mentor, Don Lawrence, has been my voice teacher since I was 11, so it’s over ten years now. And in terms of piano, piano’s funny. It’s kind of the thing that always stays with you. I don’t know if there’s any pianists in this room. But if you don’t practice for a little while and then you focus on it, you kind of get your chops back pretty quickly. So what I do mostly for piano is I try to find time when I’m in New York City or on the road to do shows and have jam sessions with my band just for fun. So whenever you see those really horrid photos of me looking drunk at a piano bar, I’m actually rehearsing. [Laughter] That’s just how I like to rehearse. I like to have a couple martinis and play some Cole Porter. And that’s just the way I like to learn. But stay in school.

     : How do I decide what to wear? It’s actually not quite as complicated as some of you might imagine. I — sometimes I’ll plan months ahead for certain things that I — for example, at the Grammy’s, the Hussein Chalayan vessel, although it’s become known as “the egg,” he wants me to remind you it’s “the vessel,” that took months and months of conception. And I wanted to do a whole performance or a piece that began on the red carpet and ended after the performance. So certain things take a while. And, yes, I do view the vessel as a fashion piece. But like today, I wore the same black dress because I wanted the fans to recognize me a certain way when I enter the Google building.

So I think maybe some of it, just from a neurological standpoint, might be because I’m creatively driven by my left side. Maybe that’s why. But he’s asked that I don’t get any more on the right side, for whatever reason. I -- I think he sees this as my, like, Marilyn Monroe side and this as my Iggy Pop side.

     : StrubyDoo. It's just -- It’s good, old faithful. I’m a creative person, and I just always — at some point, the idea comes to me. And the most important thing, I think, with creativity is that you honor your creativity and that you don’t ever ignore it or go against what that creative image is telling you because of what society is projecting on you. I remember when I called Troy Carter my manager, from Amsterdam, and I was like, “I want to be on a government-owned alien territory in space, and I want to be giving birth to my own head.”

     : And you hear the — and he goes, like, why? And I said, “Because I see myself and my fans and I feel that they give birth to me and I give birth to them, and the egg symbolized the race of the future, which bears no prejudice.” So I have my own — and I’m like — then I’m showing him Frances bacon photos, which is, like, all this bleeding imagery. And he was, like, “I don’t get it.” With Nick Knight on a video, if you think I’m bad, Nick Knight is — whoo, he is so smart, I’m like, “Nick, I love you, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.” But I just really always — like, just the other night, last night, I was lying in bed and I had this idea for an outfit, and I made myself get up and sketched it real fast and then I went back to sleep. I think it’s when you say, “I’m too tired. Let me just go to bed,” that’s when the creativity stops coming. If God calls you, pick up the damn phone. Hello. I’m listening.

      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : Maria is just so special. And she’s, like, ten — she’s ten years old. But even ten-year-olds today know how to work a webcam and upload a YouTube video. And I think that’s — that is why this — for myself, my campaign with my album has been so successful, is because I, too, am a child of the dot com era. Me and my father ran an Internet company when I was really young, so I was listening to lots of technology talk, jargon, over the dinner table, not understanding until much later what it all meant. But she’s beautiful. She’s very young, and she has a voice in the world. And she latched onto a song that was very risky for me to put out so soon in my career. But if I could just touch maybe ten ten-year-olds in the world in every single continent, maybe I could make a difference.

      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : She’s just so amazing. You know, and that’s — it’s so — What I would like to speak about is the way that we experience music now. We experience the music through the Internet, but it has really great effects and also has really negative effects. The great effect is Maria. The negative effect is you sort of quite mathematically input your songs and your soul into a computer, and out spits out charts — (indicating)
     [Laughter]
     <b key="04972efb-6887-4cb6-8210-4dfd905fb24d">
      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : So my — the fan experience now, digitally, is they buy the song, and then they get into chat rooms and they watch the song climb the chart. But somebody like Maria has no pretension. She’s wildly innocent and beautiful, and she only cares about the music and the lyrics. So what I’m working on doing now is creating a fan experience with the release of Born This Way that takes them a bit away from the computer in terms of the actual purchase of the song. I want to encourage the fans to experience the music and the lyrics removed of that sort of behind-the-computer banter. When I was a kid, I was standing outside of HMV, praying that I saw Billy Joel’s fingernail in the window. Green Day City  I was hoping that I would see Thom Yorke when Radiohead came in. You know, that is what I want to recreate for my fans. We’ve done it with the Monster Ball, and now I want to do it with album retail.

     : I love GagaVision. That was the — they were these little films that I was doing back when I first began touring. But I actually just got so busy that it was really difficult to have a camera in my face. You will never see me do reality television. It will never — don’t even ask. It will never happen. It will never happen. It’s just — I’m not that kind of person. My whole life is a performance piece. So I don’t need to have my picture taken to feel that I’m in a moment of art. So — But the good news is, as I’m planning the Born This Way Ball, I have been speaking to Terry Richardson, who’s this really amazing photographer. He wanted to film some of the making of process of what we’re doing. So I’m hoping we can resurrect the GagaVision videos for the creation of the new tour so you guys can creatively be more connected to how I make things.

Thank you for looking at my question. I really love you. Thank you for making music. Bye.
     <b key="643002bd-ada5-4d0b-97f6-9aff242eef2d">
      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : Is there anything that I regret from my past. Well, I’ll begin with the lyric, and I will say, “Don’t hide yourself in regret” is don’t perpetuate negativity in your life. Don’t obsess about the things that you didn’t do or the things that you may have not done your best, obsess about the future, obsess about today. Think endlessly about how you can pull the inner queen – or king — out of yourself, and let that superstar shine. I don’t believe that fame is something that is obtainable. I believe that it’s inside of you. It’s not something that you can touch. It’s not tangible. Which is why when I speak about the paparazzi and things, it’s very meaningless to me. There are days when I wake up, and I don’t feel like a superstar. And it’s those regrets, you say did you ever wake up and feel like a superstar. The answer is no. The regret of some days me waking up and not feeling brave enough. Those are the regrets I have. Because I have so many things to be grateful for, so many fans looking up to me. And the days when I feel insecure, those are my regrets. I want to always be secure and strong for you, because look at how sweet they are. They’re so — so genuine, and they’re listening to the lyrics, you know. And so I guess what I would say is don’t — don’t obsess over what you’ve done wrong. Always look into yourself for the answer and be the best you that you can be in the future.

     : I say that to myself every day, every single day, I say that. Because I’m not a squeaky-clean person, you know, so there’s nothing about my music or the Monster Ball or my fans that — we’re not squeaky-clean. You know, and people always say to me, “Who’s the real you?” when, in reality, I’m pretty much an open book about my life. What you’re asking me about is magic. And if you are magical, you always have shadows. If you’re in the light, you must cast a shadow.

     : Hi, Gaga, if you could describe the Born This Way album in just three words, what would they be?
     <b key="4e72e852-43e7-42ea-8fea-20d744848526">
      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : In three words. See how smart my fans are? I would call it — I would use a — It is one word, I suppose that avant-garde is one word. But I would call it avant-garde technorock. It’s a lot of — there’s a lot of rock influences on the album, but not in a — this is a rock music record kind of way. It actually is quite steadfast in that it is an exploration in electronic music and in technosonics. But I have sort of created a genre of metal dance techno pop music with a lot of rock anthemic choruses, because that is the music that I love. I’m actually really obsessed with Bruce Springstein. My father used to play Bruce Springstein records for me all the time when I was a kid, and he was, blue collar America. And in a way, I guess I related to Bruce because I watched my father, a blue collar American citizen, relate to Bruce. And I think that in a social way, my fans feel blue collar. They feel like they’re the underdogs that will someday be the winners. And I took the influence of Bruce on my father in my life to create this album. And, yeah, lots of really big, almost, like, big Def Leppard-style melodies in the choruses. But it’s electronic dance music. It’s very hard, very edgy. And I’m very excited for you to hear it.

     : One of the things that you face as an artist is censorship. So SenRG66 from Colorado asks, how do you feel about Malaysian radio stations editing out your imperative “no matter gay, straight, or bi, lesbian, transgendered life” line for Born This Way?
     <b key="5dba6096-97e3-4150-a9a6-491646f2044e">
      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : Obviously, I disagree with it. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have specifically put those words in a song that I knew would be put on top 40 radio. What I would say is, for all of the young people in Malaysian that want those words to be played on the radio, it is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard. You must do everything that you can if you want to be liberated by your society. You must call, you must not stop, you must protest peacefully. No violence — I don’t believe in violence. I don’t believe in negativity. There’s no reason to be derogatory. You just have to keep fighting for what you believe in. And to be quite honest, honesty and the truth is always what will set you free. I can’t tell you how many times I get phone calls from TV stations, and Troy will call me and he’ll say, “They want you to edit out this section of the video.” And I say, “Well, just tell them I won’t do it, and if they don’t want to play it, they don’t have to.” That’s it.

     : -- the next question is actually a composite and we’ll open up to Googler questions if you want to move to the microphones in just a minute. There were 643 fan questions asked about the next single that comes off of Born This Way, Judas. And so I’m wondering if you can tell us a little bit about the inspiration for it, the video you have planned.

     <b key="e18d3075-5fd6-4e9b-8536-11c99c683542">
      Lady Gaga
     </b>
     : It’s no surprise, I am sure, to many of you that Judas is a man of the Biblical senses. So expect to see some symbolism in this video. But the song is about — some of the words in the song I can reveal here are, “When he comes to me, I am ready. I’ll wash his feet with my hair if he needs. Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain, even after three times he betrays me. I’ll bring him down, a king with no crown.” So the song is about honoring your darkness in order to bring yourself into the light. That’s kind of what I just mentioned to about if you’re standing in the light, you cast a shadow. I have been haunted by my past for a very long time. And, actually, that’s a recurring theme on the album. It has a lot to do with identity and being able to be proud and say I was born this way. But I was haunted by being able to go back to New York, being able to go back to my past, being able to understand why I made certain decisions, that instead of regretting them, I chose to embrace and understand why I made those choices. And what the song Judas is about is, you have to look into what’s haunting you and you need to learn to forgive yourself in order to move on.

It’s — there’s always — whether you’re famous or you’re not, there’s always things in your life that you could do without. So I don’t think anything is particularly fame-related. I’ve got a really good family. And if anything, I’m grateful, because my family and I wrestled fame to the ground, and we’re stronger than ever. So no.

So I sort of take comfort in the journey of becoming good at yoga. Because if I suck it one day, nobody sees it, it’s just me.

I love getting really drunk with my friends at the same bars that we used to go to, and listening to AC/DC records. And what else do — what do I wear? I mean, to tell you the truth, it’s very funny, because my father quite often is like, “Can’t you just put on this?” But have you been to any of my shows, out of curiosity?

But it’s not this that you are responding to anymore. And I keep talking about this, because my fans are actually quite blind to my clothes now, because they’re so used to it that they don’t see it anymore. They just see me. And I’m excited about that, because I think with this new album, people will wonder less and less what I look like when I’m brushing my teeth. But the truth is, I look exactly like I look right now. I just, you know, probably have a Mötley Crüe tee shirt on, and there’s a really good-looking guy in my bed.

It’s like when you’re a kid and your mom calls you “skip,” or — instead of calling you, Johnny, she calls you Jonathan when you’re bad. It’s the same thing for me. It’s just — it was a way for me to release so many years of being told “no” by this business. And it’s actually funny, because I didn’t — I didn’t shop around to record labels until I was calling myself Gaga, until people in New York knew me as Lady Gaga. But in high school and making music and choir and being cast in the boys’ play and all the girls hated me because I always got the lead — they hated me for that, because it was at the boys’ school, so if you got the lead, you were always at the boys’ school after school.

It’s just — it was a way for me in my life — and it’s a gift I wish I could give to anyone, as if you went through hard times when you were a kid or when you were in college, or maybe you had a job that really — you know, they fired you and you were poor for two years and then you got — I wish I could give that gift to anyone of being able to say I rebuke all of that negativity, and I am now a new person, and I’m going to be the queen I know that I can be. And that’s really all that it is.

     : Thank you very much for coming. So much of your music is as you kind of labeled it, the avant-garde, technorock and kind of lends itself towards this really epic sound. And then you take those songs and you make these amazing acoustic versions that are just this polar opposite in terms of the musicality. And I was wondering if you could talk about the process of building those two songs out of the same lyrics, same notes, same chords. And is there one that you prefer like performing?

     : Well I guess what I say is a lot of times in my song writing process I will begin at the piano. So I will actually write one of the songs on the album that is truly one of my favorites, it’s called The Edge Of Glory. And it’s kind of a sad story. Sorry to be a downer. My grandpa died about five months ago and my dad and I were going to say goodbye to him at the hospice. And I got out a big thing of agave tequila, and my dad sat next to me at the piano, and we just started doing shots back and forth. And I wrote The Edge of Glory on the piano, and my dad and I cried. And the song is about your last moment on Earth, the moment of truth. The Edge of Glory is that moment right before you leave the Earth. So that song can be played on the piano, but it’s actually set to this giant, huge technorock Springsteinesque dance beat. I actually had Clarence Clemons from the E Street Band come in and play saxophone on it. It’s fucking beautiful. And I do that with a lot of my songs. But it’s funny, it’s so interesting to hear your perspective on it because that is really what I wanted to do with this album, is I wanted to show my abilities as a songwriter. So a lot of the songs are like that. There’s really no song on the album that can’t be played at a piano acoustically. It’s all about the songwriting, it’s all about my abilities as a writer from a melodic perspective. And I coproduced every song on the album. So, sonically, it just smells like me. I guess what I’m trying to say is, in my opinion, all good music can be played at a piano and still sound like a hit.

Because not many people are like you and can always say rebuke things that are bad and, you know, always look to the good.

     : Well, my mom. I have a really good mom. She really was there for me. And she always taught me to be very gracious. My mother’s the kind of person that will give you the shirt off her back if you’re cold. And that is how I was raised. But I guess I would also say — I don’t know if people in this room are religious. I always feel kind of awkward talking about religion, because I don’t want people to feel like I’m impressing any kind of belief on you. But I do see — I do believe that God comes in many forms. And I don’t believe that we know what he looks like. That’s something that I actually address in Judas. But I see God in my fans. So every night when I look into the audience, I feel like I see this — this force of beauty and that I don’t know, it’s just faith. So I see faith in my fans. And that’s what keeps me strong, is them, is I really — when I go out there, I don’t go out after the show and get plastered and do a ton of drugs and when I go on stage the next day I can barely sing. I’m very, very disciplined and hard-working. And I am a — as a blond woman with tits and ass, very proud of my accomplishments as a musician. And I say that with lots of strength. People call it arrogance. But I do believe that women in pop music have a very bad rap. And I think people have learned to expect very little from all of us. And it’s very unfair. It’s very prejudiced. So me and my tits and my ass and my brain are very proud to be here today.

When I was on my first record label, Def Jam, not to bring up a sour story, but I sent all of the employees at Def Jam Disco balls that I hand-painted myself, like that, except I wrote “Gaga” all over them. And I sent them huge bags of candy from the Dollar Store with these Disco balls that had my name on it. And I got dropped, like, a month later. But I just remember someone called and told me that everybody in the office was, like, “Who sent all these gummy worms and Disco balls that say ‘Gaga?'” I hand-painted those suckers, every one of them. Well, this is very good. And this is very good, because it looks almost exactly like my Thierry Mugler-inspired outfit from the very first Fame Ball. This is amazing, because it looks just like the "Telephone" video. However, I have to say that the mark of a true Gaga fan is always thinking forward. And that is you.

     : Yeah, that’s really — he’s really tattooed that way. And I asked him, when we were on the set, I said, “Why did you get” — it’s kind of like a weird, funny question — “but why did you tattoo yourself this way?” And he said, “Bazooka Gum.” I said, “What do you mean, Bazooka Gum?” And he said, “Well you know how Bazooka Gum comes with the stick-on tattoos?” He said, “I really liked them and I loved punk rock when I was a kid, so I just used to listen to punk rock and put Bazooka Gum tatoos on, so I tattooed my face like this.” So that’s why we chewed bubble gum in the video. But I wanted to tribute Rico, because I believe — what this look represented to me was that I will not allow society or critics to dictate my beauty. I tell you what I believe is beautiful about me. Every person defines their own beauty for themselves. So that’s what that makeup represents to me, is that Rico was defining who he is in an artistic way and not relying on society to tell him what makes him valuable.
