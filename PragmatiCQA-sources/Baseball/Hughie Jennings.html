   .  He managed the Cornell baseball team while studying law and concluded that he was well-suited to being a manager.
   Jennings continued as a scholar-athlete until the spring of 1904, when he left campus early to manage the Orioles.  Though he never finished his law degree at Cornell, Jennings passed the Maryland bar exam in 1905 and started a law practice.
   He continued to work at his law practice during the off-season through the remainder of his baseball career.

   During his years as Detroit’s manager, Jennings became famous for his antics, mostly in the third base coaching box, which variously included shouts of “
   <b key="899ad1d6-5fde-4d9a-8443-d1f75db04b46">
    Ee-Yah
   </b>
   ,” and other whoops, whistles, horns, gyrations, jigs, and grass-plucking.  The "Ee-Yah" whoop became his trademark and was accompanied with waves of both arms over his head and a sharp raising of his right knee.  In 1907, he was suspended for taunting opponents with a tin whistle.
   The "Ee-Yah" shouts continued and became such a trademark that Jennings became known as Hughie "Ee-Yah" Jennings, and Detroit fans would shout "Ee-Yah" when Jennings would appear on the field.

   .
   One of his greatest challenges, and accomplishments, during his years in Detroit was to manage the unmanageable --
   Ty Cobb
   .  Jennings recognized Cobb’s talent and his complicated psychological makeup and concluded the best strategy would be to let Cobb be Cobb.  Jennings reportedly called Cobb aside one day and said: “There isn’t anything about baseball I can teach you.  Anything I might say to you would merely hinder you in your development.  The only thing for you to do is go ahead and do as you please.  Use your own judgment.. . . . . Do what you think is best and I’ll back you up.”

   In
   1912
   , during a game in which "pick-ups" played for the Tigers when the regular team went on strike to protest the suspension of Cobb after an incident involving a fan in the stands whom Cobb assaulted, Jennings, who also sent his
   coaches
   in as substitute players, came to bat himself once as a
   pinch hitter
   . According to one source, when the
   umpire
   asked him for whom he was batting, Jennings answered, "None of your business." The umpire noted on his lineup sheet, "Jennings--batted for exercise." (Source,

   While Jennings was fiery, hard-nosed, colorful, and even eccentric, he insisted he had always played the game honestly.  When a scandal arose in 1926 concerning whether
   Ty Cobb
   and
   Tris Speaker
   had fixed a 1919 game between Detroit and Cleveland—while Jennings was the manager--, Jennings initially spoke of how easy it would be to fix a game and issued a "no comment" on the specific game.  After his "no comment" drew negative publicity, Jennings issued a statement to the press in December 1926 denying knowledge of the matter and adding: "My slate has been clean base ball for 35 years. . . . Whatever I have done in base ball has been of such a nature that I would be ready any time to go before anyone and place my case before them."  (

   McGraw and Jennings staged a reunion year after year on their birthdays.
   When McGraw became ill, Jennings filled in as the Giants' manager for parts of 1924 and 1925.  His overall managing record was 1184-995.

   Jennings’ life was filled with several tragic accidents.  There was the beaning incident in Philadelphia  that left him unconscious for three days.  While attending Cornell, he fractured his skull diving head-first into a swimming pool at night, only to find the pool had been emptied.
