   The Robisons' decision to reduce Cleveland to minor league standards, along with other intra-league raiding such as that conducted by the Dodgers, unwittingly helped pave the way to the National League's loss of its major league monopoly. The 12th-place Spiders were one of four teams contracted out of the National League at the end of the 1899 season. The others were the 11th-place Senators, the ninth-place Louisville club and, surprisingly, the fourth-place Baltimore club. The very next year, the then-minor
