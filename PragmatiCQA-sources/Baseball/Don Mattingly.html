   Mattingly's career came crashing down in
   1990
   , when he again began to suffer from severe back problems. He tried to play through it, but struggled with the bat and had to go on the disabled list in July. He came back late in the season but was still ineffective. He underwent extensive therapy in the off-season and made it into the lineup in
   1991
   . Mattingly was still an above-average hitter, but the injuries had robbed him of much of his power. He played five more seasons, but never again batted higher than .304 (and that was in the strike-shortened
   1994
   season) or hit more than 17 home runs.

   . However, observers note that his chances are severely hurt by his relatively short career and the fact that his strong seasons were limited to a six year period between 1984 and 1989. Mattingly has never been named on more than 28% of ballots cast for the hall of fame, and most recently in
   2006
   he was only named on 12% of the ballots. (For election, a player must be mentioned on 75% of the ballots.)

   Kirby Puckett
