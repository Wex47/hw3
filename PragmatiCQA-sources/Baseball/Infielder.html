   The nine fielding positions are universal in high-level competitive baseball, and the actual positions taken on the field are exceptionally stable. Teams differ, and players shift, at most several steps for tactical purposes.
   Contrast the fielding positions in cricket and some "football" games: even within a single team, positions vary so much from time to time that they have different names. What varies in baseball is how people think and write about the game, occasionally using
   <i key="d42dd69e-bd05-452a-8c41-1a608be6eac5">
    infielders
   </i>
   to mean a different group of positions. In writing, such a departure from the standard grouping should be explained.

   Among the four infielders in modern professional play, shortstops are generally the best fielders, followed by second basemen, third basemen, and first basemen in that order.  First basemen should be adept at fielding poorly thrown balls, as many a throw is hurried to put out the
