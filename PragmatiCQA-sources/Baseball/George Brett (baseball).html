   and used home plate to measure the amount of pine tar, a legal substance used by hitters to improve their grip, on Brett's bat.  Martin cited an obscure rule that stated the pine tar on a bat could extend no further than 18 inches. Brett's pine tar extended about 24 inches.  Earlier in the season, the Yankees had taken note Brett's habit of adding pine tar further than the allowed 18 inches, but waited until a crucial time to point it out to the umpires.

   Years later, Brett explained his outburst by saying "It was just such an extraordinary thing to hit a homer off [Gossage], the thought of losing it was too much". In the same interview he also humorously chided his teammate

   The game was continued later that season, starting after Brett's homer. Billy Martin had one last trick up his sleeve, appealing the play before, saying the umpires had no way of knowing Brett and the other runner had touched all the bases. Martin was stunned when the umpires produced affidavits saying he had. The game had virtually no effect on 1983's pennant race, but was in many ways the closing chapter on a heated rivalry.  The video of the enraged Brett is replayed often on the anniversary date of
   July 24
   , and the Pine Tar Game has become part of baseball folklore.  The Brett's famous pine tar bat is now on display at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.
