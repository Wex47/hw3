Barry Bonds broke Hank Aaron's career home run record when he hit his 756th home run (22nd of the season) on Tuesday night, August 7, 2007 in San Francisco vs. Mike Bacsik (Jr.) of the Washington Nationals.  Congratulatory messages were sent by Hank Aaron and Commissioner Bud Selig.  Frank Robinson represented Selig.

   Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure at the center of the

(He did fail an amphetamines test in 2006, but there is no penalty for a first offense of that nature). To date Bonds has not been charged with any crime in connection with the BALCO incident. Additionally, a recent grand jury retired without issuing a single indictment.

   In 1986, Bonds finished 6th in Rookie of the Year voting, hitting 16 home runs and stealing 36 bases. Over the next 3 years, he would be criticized for not living up to his potential, despite having some respectable numbers. He hit 25 home runs in his sophomore season along with 32 stolen bases, and made the NL top 10 in triples, runs scored, and extra base hits.  In 1988, he got even better, hitting .283 with 24 home runs, the latter being among the league leaders.  He also made the top 10 in slugging, on-base %, runs scored, total bases, extra base hits, times on base, intentional walks, and at-bat per home run ratio. He started off his 1989 campaign well, but then struggled(and failed) to hit 20 home runs, and his whole campaign suffered. He did crack the top 10 in walks, runs, doubles, extra base hits, intentional walks, stolen bases, and games played. It should be noted that Bonds likely would've also made the top 10 in RBI at some point during his first 4 years, but, despite leading the team in home runs, Jim Leyland deemed him not ready to be a run producer.  1990 however, was the year that Bonds really came into his own.  He won the MVP for the first time, hitting .301 with 33 home runs and 114 RBI (finally out of the leadoff spot).  His 52 stolen bases were good for third in the league.  He won his first Gold Glove and Silver Slugger Awards. He made the top 10 in on-base %, runs scored, total bases, doubles, home runs, RBI, walks, extra base hits, times on base, and intentional walks, and he led the league in slugging% (.565). In 1991, his home run production was down (25), but he drove in 116 runs, stole 43 bases, walked 107 times, led the league in on-base %, and won another Gold Glove and Silver Slugger award. His surly attitude towards the media allowed

   to win more MVP votes than him, and he only came in second, despite being the superior player. In 1992, Bonds would not be denied, as he won his 2nd MVP, despite hitting the DL for the first time. He dominated the NL, hitting .311, leading the league in on-base %, slugging %, runs scored, walks, extra base hits, intentional walks, and times on base. Bonds would help propel the Pirates to the playoffs, and then he would be involved in the play that would send the Pirates home, making a relatively poor throw to the plate on a single by pinch-hitter

   contract (worth a then-record $43.75 million over six years) with the Giants, with whom his father spent the first seven years of his career. In 1993, Bonds peaked (at least until almost a decade later). He hit .336, and led the league with 46 home runs, 123 RBI, a .677 slugging %, a .458 on-base %, and 365 total bases. Unfortunately, as good as the Giants were (winning over 100 games), the Braves were even better, and despite Bonds's late season efforts, the Giants missed the playoffs.  This is the primary reason for the existence of the wildcard.  
In 1994, at the strike, Bonds was on a tear, and had a wicked bat after the all star break. His season numbers looked really good too. He hit .312 with 37 home runs (was projected to have his first 50 home run season when the strike hit), was leading the league in walks, and was among the league leaders in slugging %, onbase %, extra base hits,and stolen bases, among other things.
In 1995, Bonds had another great season.  He made the top 6 in slugging %, runs scored, total bases, triples, home runs, RBI, extra base hits and times on base, and he led the league in games played, on-base%, walks, intentional walks and times on base. He had another great season of defense.  And all of his accomplishments for 1995 were unacknowledged.  He didn't win the silver slugger or gold glove awards, and he didn't even make the top 10 in the MVP voting, despite having far more impressive numbers than the MVP Barry Larkin.
In 1996, Bonds made history, becoming the first NL'er to hit 40 home runs and steal 40 bases in the same season (42 and 40). He drove in 129 runs and walked a then-National League record 151 times.  He also hit .308, and made the top 5 in on-base%, slugging %, runs, RBI, and home runs. Finally, he joined the very exclusive 300 home run/300 stolen base club, with fellow members Willie Mays, Andre Dawson, and his own father, Bobby Bonds. In 1997, Bonds hit .291, his lowest number since 1989, but his other numbers were very impressive. He hit 40 home runs again, drove in 101 runs, and made the top 6 in on-base %, slugging %, games played, runs scored, home runs, stolen bases, extra base hits, and times on base.  He also led the league in walks again with 145, just 6 off his NL record of a year before. He tied his father in 1997 for having the most 30/30 seasons in a career (and would've likely broken it if not for the strike).  
In 1998, Bonds got off to a very rocky start, and some were starting to wonder if Barry was beginning to age. By season's end however, he had put those notions to rest. He hit .303 with 37 home runs, drove in 122 runs, and made the top 10 in virtually every single offensive category, often top 5. He won his 8th Gold Glove, and made history, becoming the first man ever to have 400 home runs and 400 stolen bases and yet, was only voted 8th in the MVP voting, likely due to baseball's home run fever in 1998, led by the McGwire/Sosa home run chase.

As of 1999, James rated Bonds as the 16th best player of all time, even though his career was far from complete.  "When people begin to take in all of his accomplishments," James predicted, "Bonds may well be rated among the five greatest players in the history of the game."

   By the year
   2000
   Bonds was regarded as a surefire Hall of Famer, but it was in the beginning of the next millennium when Bonds would surpass his peers and reach a level of offensive production that only a select few in the history of the game have achieved. In 1999, he hit 34 home runs in just 355 at-bats in just 102 games. In 2000, at age 36, Bonds hit .306, slugged .688 (career best at that time), hit 49 home runs in just 143 games (also a career high to that point), and collected a league-leading 117 walks. He had started off that season even hotter, hitting 28 home runs and slugging over .730 at the all star break, but some minor injuries on the season quieted him down somewhat. The next year, however, he would make his 2000 season look pathetic by comparison. Barry Bonds put on an offensive show in 2001. He started off slow, but once he hit his 500th home run, he took off. Through the teams first 50 games, he'd already compiled 28 home runs. He hit 73 home runs, the major league record, but that's just the beginning. He hit 39 home runs by the all-star break (ML record), hit a home run every 6.52 at-bats (ML record-McGwire in '98 hit one every 7.2), drew 177 walks (ML record at the time), had a .515 on-base percentage, a feat not seen since Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams some 40+ years before him. He also had an ML record and absolutely absurd .863 slugging percentage (411 total bases in just 476 at-bats), and his OPS (on-base+slugging) was miniscule percentage points behind Babe Ruth in 1920 for the highest of all time. In 2002, he didn't stop. He hit 46 home runs, but he did that in just 403 at-bats in only 143 games. He hit a career high .370, struck out only 47 times, and despite playing in 9 fewer games than the season before, he shattered his own walks record, drawing 198, with a ML record 68 intentional. He slugged .799, at the time, at the time the 4th highest total all time. And, he broke Ted Williams' ML record for on-base%, with a staggering .583. He also broke Ruth's OPS record this season by 2 points. And, he hit his 600th home run, less than a year and a half after hitting his 500th. 2003 was tough for Bonds. A little more injury-plaged in 2003, Bonds played in just 130 games.  However, he still won his 3rd straight MVP.  He hit 45 home runs in just 390 at-bats, along with a .341 batting average. He slugged .749, walked 148 times, and had an on-base % well over .500 for the 3rd straight year. He also turned himself into the charter and only member of the 500 home run/500 stolen base club.  Finally, in 2004, Bonds had what was arguably his best season. He hit .362, and absolutely blew away his own walks record(again), drawing an awesome 232 walks, 137 more than AL leader Eric Chavez. He slugged .812, 4th highest all time, and broke his on-base % record by becoming the first person to have an on-base % over .600. He also broke his OPS record. He passed his godfather on the all time home run list, then hit his 700th home run near the end of the season. And, he hit 45 home runs in just 373 at-bats, and he struck out just 41 times, putting him in elite company, as few people have ever had more home runs than strikeouts in a season. In the new millennium, MLB was shrouded with the controversy of steroids. Even though Bonds has never tested positive, suspicion was cast.  During an investigation of BALCO Laboratories Bonds' Grand Jury testimony was illegally leaked and obtained by the media. In the testimony he allegedly admitted he may have unknowingly been given "the clear" and "the cream", when he was told the substances were flaxseed oil. This ignited much media speculation on Bonds in relation to the BALCO investigation.

At the press conference, Bonds also indicated that he was having psychological problems and was frustrated by the focus on his alleged steroid use and the negative portrayal of him in the media. Later, Bonds sounded positive about his rehabilitation and told fans at the Opening Day festivities, "I will be back!"

   — Bonds allegedly said Anderson gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance he called "the cream" and "the clear". BALCO founder Victor Conte had identified "the clear" as the designer steroid THG, and prosecutors contended "the cream" was a testosterone-based ointment. Bonds said that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids, deeming instead that they were flaxseed oil and arthritis cream.

   , it was reported that federal prosecutors had obtained Barry Bonds’ medical files as part of their investigation into whether the slugger perjured himself when he said he never knowingly used steroids. U.S. Attorney Kevin Ryan had said he had postponed his decision on whether to seek an indictment of Bonds "in light of some recent developments", and the receipt of the medical records was apparently one of those developments. The records are believed to include information about three operations Bonds had last season to treat his right knee, as well as a serious elbow injury that required surgery in 1999. Bonds’ former girlfriend, Kimberly Bell, testified that Bonds blamed the elbow injury on steroid use. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, prosecutors had subpoenaed the documents nearly two months ago, but Bonds’ attorneys went to federal court to stop the government from obtaining the records.

At one point, Bonds even started to break down in tears.  "If it makes them happy to go out of their way to try to destroy me, go right ahead.  You can't hurt me any more than you've already hurt me," he said.  He continued by saying, "You don't see me bringing anyone else into this. I'm going to take it myself."

"I'd never seen the expression on Jim Brock's face that I saw right there," ASU hitting coach Jeff Pentland told Pearlman. "Absolute shock.

Canizaro, who admitted to have used steroids while at Oklahoma State, said Bonds reported to spring training with remarkable additional muscle, an acne-coated back and a new trainer--Greg Anderson.
