   A manager of a baseball team would like the starting pitcher to pitch as many innings as possible in a game. Most regular starting pitchers pitch for at least five innings on a regular basis, and if they are unable to do so, there is a high probability they will be moved to the

   . Oftentimes, starting pitchers are on a
   pitch count
   , meaning the manager will seek to remove them from the game once they have thrown a specific number of pitches. The most common pitch count for modern pitchers is 100. Pitch counts are especially common for starting pitchers who are recovering from

   A starting pitcher must complete five innings of work in order to qualify for a win in a game he starts. However, it is possible to be credited with a loss despite pitching fewer than five innings.  A starter who works six or more innings while giving up three or fewer runs is said to have achieved a
