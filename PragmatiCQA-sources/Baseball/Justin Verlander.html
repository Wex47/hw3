   Justin's brother Ben Verlander also threw a no-hitter at Justin's old High School. He was in the 9th grade and 
pitched against Amelia County High School. He pitched a complete game without giving up a hit in the 11-0 
win over Amelia.  Justin's no-hitter came only a short while after his brother Ben's.
