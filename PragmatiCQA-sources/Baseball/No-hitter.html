   who prevents the opposing team from achieving a hit is said to have "thrown a no-hitter." The achievement of a no-hitter is rare and considered to be an extraordinary accomplishment for a pitcher or pitching staff. In most cases in the professional game, no-hitters are accomplished by a single pitcher who throws a complete game.

   Labeling a game as a no-hitter does not imply that the opposing team has not reached base, since it is quite possible to reach base without a hit. Thus a no-hitter does not imply a shutout, and although it is extremely uncommon, it is possible for a pitcher to throw a no-hitter and yet lose the game (see

   . A perfect game has been defined by Major League Baseball as a game in which a pitcher pitches a complete game victory that lasts a minimum of nine innings and in which no opposition player reaches first base. Thus a perfect game is a shutout, a victory, and also a no-hitter. In a perfect game a pitcher will have retired all twenty seven batters he has faced.

  <p key="b71ccd3f-509c-40f1-bcb2-77432638dfa1">
   Whenever a pitcher is working on a no-hitter or perfect game, his teammates tend to stay far away from him in the dugout and will not mention in any way (not even to other teammates) that a no-hitter is in progress, because it is believed that doing so will jinx the pitcher trying for the no-hitter.  Sports commentators however, do tend to mention no-hitters in progress, and are sometimes blamed for jinxing no-hitters.

   After an unprecedented nine no-hitters in 1990, and on the way to eight in 1991, including one in regulation broken up in extra innings, one ended early because of weather, and one where the losing pitcher gave up no hits, but errors caused the team to lose, and the home side did not have to bat, Major League Baseball changed the rules so that only no-hit games of nine or more full innings ending with no hits are officially recognized. No-hitters and perfect games that go into extra innings because the score is tied at the end of regulation play (including 0-0 ties) are only recognized if the game finishes without it being broken up. Rain-shortened "official game" no-hitters are also no longer recognized (though they always had an "
