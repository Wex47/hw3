   While serving as a federal judge, Landis was selected to become the first Commissioner of Major League

   , serving from 1920 until his death in 1944. The position was created to restore public confidence in the integrity of baseball following the 1919
   Black Sox scandal
   , only the worst of a number of incidents that jeopardized the integrity of the game. He achieved this by permanently banishing eight players from the sport for their Black Sox scandal involvement, including Buck Weaver and superstar
   Shoeless Joe Jackson
   , and by dealing harshly with others proven to have thrown individual games or consorted with gamblers. He also banned New York Giants players Phil Douglas, Bennie Kauff and Jimmy O'Connell, Phillies pitcher Gene Paulette, Giants coach Cozy Dolan, and (in 1943) Phillies owner William D. Cox.

  <p key="e25bed52-6381-4c87-bfe0-76072f469d30">
   The owners had hoped he would then settle into a comfortable retirement as the titular head of baseball. Instead, Landis established a fiercely independent Commissioner's Office that would go on to often make both players and owners miserable with decisions that were, generally, in the best interests of the game. He worked to clean up the hooliganism that was tarnishing the reputation of players in the 1920s, and inserted his office into negotiations with players where he deemed appropriate to end a few of the labor practices of owners like
   Charles Comiskey
   that had contributed to the players' discontent.
  </p>
  <p key="57e52bff-13cc-44f9-95eb-cf605a63a44b">
   His detractors claim he perpetuated the
   color line
   and prolonged the segregation of organized baseball.  Although still disputed, club owner
   Bill Veeck
   claimed Landis prevented him from purchasing the
   <a href="Philadelphia Phillies.html" key="faeb1d36-4a76-4ffb-bd21-8e0a256cc46f" title="Philadelphia Phillies">

   when Landis learned of Veeck's plan to integrate the team.  Landis tried to curb the growth of
   minor league
   farm systems by innovators such as
   Branch Rickey
   , in the name of protecting the lower levels of professional ball (the farm systems ultimately proved to be the salvation of minor league ball). Landis argued that because a parent club could unilaterally call up players from teams which were involved in pennant races, the organization was unfairly interfering with the minor competitions; his position was that the championship of each minor league was of no less importance than the championships of the major leagues, and that minor league fans and supporters had the right to see their teams competing as best they could. Yet he also prevented the formation of a powerful third major league when he turned away a challenge by
   Pants Rowland
   and his
   Pacific Coast League
   in the 1940s.

   Whether his decisions were praised or criticized, he was satisfied with being respected and feared. Dubbed 'the baseball tyrant' by journalists of the day, his rule was absolute. In the context of ensuring the integrity of the game itself, baseball historians generally regard him as the right man at the right time when appointed, but also as a man who perhaps held office too long.
