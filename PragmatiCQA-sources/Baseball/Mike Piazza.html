   Piazza was the last player the Dodgers drafted of the 1988 draft. He was their selection in the 62nd round, and baseball magazines such as the 1994 edition of Athlon Baseball mentioned how rare such a feat is of a low draft pick becoming such a prominent player. It is believed that the pick was partly a favor on the part of Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda, who is godfather to one of Piazza's brothers and, like Piazza, grew up in Norristown. Piazza swore he'd learn to catch if he was drafted. Piazza's major league debut came with the Dodgers in 1992, when he appeared in 21 games. He then won the National League Rookie of the Year Award in 1993.
  </p>
  <p key="9a58b6d8-810f-4ea5-93a0-731726ddca0f">
   Piazza's best season was 1997, a year when he finished second in MVP voting. He hit .362 (tying the Yankees' Bill Dickey (1936) for highest batting average by a catcher in one season), with 40 home runs and 124 runs batted in, an on base percentage of .431 and a slugging percentage of .638.
  </p>
  <p key="d993f455-83be-446f-8bb3-a4b3fe6a8edf">
   He played six full seasons for the Dodgers until he was traded to the Florida Marlins on May 15, 1998. Piazza and Todd Zeile went to the Marlins in return for Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Bobby Bonilla, Manuel Barrios, and Jim Eisenreich. The trade, precipitated by a contract dispute, is regarded by many as one of the worst moves in Dodgers history. One week later, on May 22, Piazza was traded from the Marlins to the New York Mets for Preston Wilson, Ed Yarnall, and Geoff Goetz.
  </p>
  <p key="46ade925-d566-4783-9a3f-0b965ab220fb">
   Piazza helped the Mets to two consecutive playoff appearances for the only time in Mets history in 1999 and 2000. The latter of the two resulted in a National League Pennant and World Series appearance, where the Mets lost in five games to a Yankee team winning their fourth World Series in five years. Of note, all five games were decided by two runs or less, something that had not occurred in a World Series in almost 70 years. He became known as The Monster after coach John Stearns was caught on tape during the 2000 NLCS after a Piazza hit saying "The Monster is out of the Cage!"
  </p>
  <p key="62f42a0c-ea3e-4171-b84c-3d1966fd7ca2">
   Piazza was involved in a bizarre incident in Game 2 of the 2000 World Series. In the first inning, Piazza was facing Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens and broke his bat fouling off a pitch. The barrel of his bat flew towards Clemens's feet at the pitcher's mound. Clemens picked up the broken barrel and heaved it in the direction of Piazza running up the first base line sparking both benches to clear, but no ejections. The reason this incident sparked this reaction was because earlier in the season, during Interleague play when the Mets played the Yankees, Mike Piazza was drilled in the head by a Roger Clemens pitch. Mike Piazza suffered a concussion as a result of this and created tension between the two since it was speculated by some that Clemens had hit Piazza on purpose. Words were exchanged after the bat incident but no further altercations resulted from this.
  </p>
  <p key="0e79fff0-a25a-41e4-a730-5211db1da128">
   One of the most emotional moments of Piazza's career came when he belted a dramatic two-run home run in the eighth inning against Steve Karsay on September 21, 2001 in New York City to lift the Mets to a 3-2 triumph over the Braves. The game was the first regular season professional sporting event held in New York City after the September 11, 2001 attacks.
  </p>
  <p key="4827df69-e095-450f-b516-79de91a0c4d9">
   To ease the stress on his deteriorating knees, Piazza began to split his time between catching and playing first base during the 2004 season, an experiment which was abandoned before the end of the season because of Piazza's defensive deficiencies. Although recognized as a great hitter, Piazza does not get enough credit for his handling of pitchers, having caught two no hitters thrown by Ramón Martínez and Hideo Nomo. Nomo's was particularly impressive because it happened at Coors Field. In his 14-year career (through 2006), Piazza's career batting average is .309 with 419 home runs, 1,288 RBI, and 308 doubles in 1,702 games.
  </p>
  <p key="de78eebe-2775-4fa4-9574-f05dfc2731fc">
   On May 5, 2004, Piazza surpassed Carlton Fisk for most home runs by a catcher with his 352nd as a catcher.
  </p>
  <p key="0a3bdab0-e05e-43ff-bfb8-0085ea6a591f">
   On October 2, 2005, Piazza filed for free agency, effectively ending his career with the Mets. He signed with the San Diego Padres on January 29, 2006 and is their starting catcher and clean-up hitter. Piazza experienced somewhat of a rejuvenation in 2006, batting .283 with 22 homers and leading the Padres to a division title. Piazza, who was drafted late in the baseball draft, is proving critics wrong yet again, this time over a decade later. On July 21, 2006, Mike Piazza collected his 2,000th career hit in the major leagues.
  </p>
  <p key="d2da7270-c8bb-4e1c-be4c-7e111d7dbd8a">
   On August 8, 2006, Piazza played his first game at Shea Stadium since leaving the Mets. During the three-game series, Piazza drew frequent, repeated standing ovations indicative of the high level of regard New York's fans still hold for him. Even more telling was an event on August 9 during that series in which he drew a rare curtain call in an opposing park following a home run off Mets pitcher Pedro Martinez.

Mike Piazza is a shoo-in fior the Hall of Fame, and figures to become the first Italiam-American player elected in his first year of eligibility (Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra were not).

On December 6, 2006, Piazza signed a 1-year, $8.5 million deal with the Oakland Athletics. He is expected to replace Frank Thomas as the A's designated hitter.

    On August 8, 2006, Piazza returned to Shea Stadium in a Padres uniform for the first time since signing with them in January. Piazza received constant cheers, ovations and chanting of his name from the second he stepped foot on the field for batting practice until leaving the field after his final at-bat in the 8th inning. In his first at-bat in the second inning, Piazza received a two-minuite standing ovation as Shea Stadium played Voodoo Child, by Jimi Hendrix. It was considered by Mets fans the biggest welcome back since Tom Seaver returned in 1977 as a member of the Cincinnati Reds. New York would win the game 3-2.

    He was referenced in a song by Scottish indie-rock group Belle &amp; Sebastian entitled "Piazza, New York Catcher." At one point, the singer asks, "Piazza, New York Catcher, are you straight or are you gay?". This plays off the rumor, denied by Piazza, that he is gay. The rumor apparently began when a major sports magazine reported that a MLB player on the East Coast was gay.
