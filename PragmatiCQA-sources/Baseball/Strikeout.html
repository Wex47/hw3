    Kc
   </b>
   . The use of "K" for a strikeout was invented by
   Henry Chadwick
   , a newspaper journalist who is widely credited as the originator of the
   box score
   , a grid that summarized the relevant actions of every batter and pitcher at the end of the game, as well as the baseball scorecard, essentially an expanded box score with which a fan can record individual at bats while the game is played. Both the box score and scorecard persist largely unchanged to this day, as the game itself is largely unchanged except for the number of balls and strikes allowed to the pitcher and batter. The letter "S" was used to coin "sacrifice" so Mr. Chadwick decided to use "K", with "K" being the last letter in "struck." Mr. Chadwick also invented many other baseball scoring abbreviations, such as using numbers to designate player positions (progressing from the battery, pitcher [1] and catcher [2], through the infield [with the shortstop counted after the basemen, at number 6, to the right fielder [9]).
  </p>
  <p key="7dad842e-1e99-47ee-9c92-651635eca73d">
   That Mr. Chadwick first established the convention of using the "K" abbreviation is well founded, with reliable and authentic primary materials surviving. (See citation above) Those unaware of Mr. Chadwick's contributions have speculated that "K" was derived from the 19th century pitcher
   Matt Kilroy
   's last name. If not for the evidence supporting Mr. Chadwick's earlier use of "K", this speculation would be reasonable: Kilroy did much to raise the prominence of the strikeout, setting an all-time record of 513 strikeouts in 1886, only two years after overhand pitching was permitted. Kilroy's record, however, is forever confined to its era: the pitcher's mound during his record-setting season was only 50 feet from the batter; it was moved to its current distance of 60'6" in 1893. The modern record (1901-) is 383 strikeouts, held by Nolan Ryan, one better than Sandy Koufax's 382.

   to record pitchers' strikeouts, "SO" has traditionally and typically been used to denote a
   <a href="Shutout.html" key="2d1c02bc-98a4-41bf-bf3a-7ef6fde235d2" title="Shutout">
    shutout
   </a>
   . Also, the term "K" is traditionally distinguished as a pitchers' statistic: it refers to a pitcher's striking out of a batter rather than a batter's striking out against a pitcher. That is, after a strikeout, a pitcher earns a "K", while a batter is charged with an "SO". A statistical record of a batter's strikeouts, over the course of a season, game, or career, usually uses the heading "SO" and the use of "K" has always been rare for batters.
  </p>
  <p key="ad3593a9-23be-426d-9c9c-dde6fc494a98">
   However, the use of "K" in statistical records has in recent years been used less even for pitchers's records, with the colorful but non-intuitive "K" giving way to the more accessible "SO". Most major baseball compendiums, including the Baseball Encyclopedia as well as Sports Illustrated's and ESPN's online databases, use "SO" for pitchers as well as batters. This is quite possibly due to the fact that shutouts are a much rarer occurrence today even among the best pitchers, as a starting pitcher is typically relieved after reaching a certain pitch count, even if throwing a shutout in the late innings. Therefore, there is little need to preserve "SO" for shutouts, and it is now usually abbreviated "ShO" or "SHO". Complete games of any kind are rare, and shutouts are infrequent in recent years. In the past few years, throwing two to four shutouts over the course of the season has been enough to lead either leagues, in some cases with three to five pitchers tied with two or three shutouts (in the course of 36 to 40 starts).
  </p>
  <p key="f7f77a57-360c-423c-a49b-7ab2d15b219c">
   The "K" abbreviation, however, is still commonly used by fans and enthusiasts. In one baseball ritual, fans at the ballpark who are seated in view of the batter (and the television cameras) attach a succession of small "K" signs to the nearest railing, one added for every strikeout notched by the home team's pitcher. As is traditional for those who keep a record of the game on paper, the "K" is placed backwards in cases where the batter strikes out looking. Virtually every televised display of a major league game in which a pitcher registers a high number of strikeouts (7 or 8) will include a shot of a fan's strikeout display, and if the pitcher continues to strike out batters, the display often will be shown following every strikeout. In the event that a known "strikeout pitcher" is on the mound--in recent years including

   (Rule #11)
  </p>
  <p key="85aaca88-4989-437b-b677-8d2810ceffec">
   This is essentially the same rule in use today, with the addition of the called strike (1858) and the provision that the batter is automatically out if there are less than two out and a runner on first. In
   1880
   , the rules were changed to specify that a fifth strike had to be caught on the fly. In
   1887
   , the number of strikes for an out was changed to four, but promptly changed back to five the next season. A foul
   bunt
   was classified as a strike in
   1894
   , and a foul tip in
   1895

   , describing the plate umpire's punching motion on a called fifth strike, which resembles the motion most umpires use to call a baserunner out, but is usually more vigorous, perhaps reflecting an unspoken belief that looking at a third strike is somewhat more blameworthy than making any other out. On a called third strike, it is said that the batter was

   </i>
   or that he looked at a strike. Typically, a called third strike can be somewhat more embarrassing for a batter, as it shows that he was either fooled by the pitcher, or even worse, had a moment of hesitation. A pitcher is said to "strike out the side" when he retires all three batters in a half inning by striking them out. A batter that takes the third strike looking, especially on a breaking pitch, such as a slider or a curveball, that appears to be out of the strike zone but drops in before the batter can get the bat off his shoulders, can be said to be "frozen."

   In slang, when a batter strikes out five times in a game, he is said to have completed a "hat trick". If he strikes out six times, it is a "golden sombrero" or a "silver sombrero". He receives the "Olympic rings" for striking out seven times and the "horn" for striking out eight times in a game - a rare occurrence, which in the history of major league play has only been accomplished in

   It is thus possible for a pitcher to throw four strikeouts in an innning. The first major leaguer to be credited with the feat was Ed Crane of the
   New York Giants
   on October 4, 1888. The feat was once rare, occurring only five times before 1956, but is now so common that it happened six times in 1999.
