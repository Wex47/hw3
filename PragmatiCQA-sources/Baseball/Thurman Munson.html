Anderson's comment at the post-World Series press conference -- "Don't ever embarrass anybody by comparing him to Johnny Bench" -- may have been a tribute to a great player, but it angered Munson (who overheard as he waited to go into the interview room) and his teammates; though his team was swept, for four days Munson was every bit as good as Bench.

   . Although Fisk's ability to play until he was 45 years old allowed him to build up career statistics that far exceeded Munson's, in the seven seasons in which they were both full-time catchers (1972-78), they were roughly equal both at the plate and behind it; while Fisk's numbers were slightly better in each case, it was Munson who brought his team to the postseason three times, compared to Fisk's one.
