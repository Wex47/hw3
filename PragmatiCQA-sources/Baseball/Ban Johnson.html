   The NL then made a critical blunder by limiting salaries to $2,400--a low sum even by 1901 standards.  Johnson, Comiskey and the other AL owners responded by raiding NL rosters, promising disgruntled players much higher salaries.  Eventually, over 100 players "jumped" to the new league.  After a two-year war in which the AL trounced the NL in attendance both seasons, the NL sued for peace.  Under a new National Agreement, the AL was formally recognized as the second major league.  A three-man National Commission was set up, comprised of both league presidents and Reds owner

   The final nail in Johnson's coffin proved to be the
   Black Sox Scandal
   .  Johnson blew off Comiskey's claims that his White Sox may have been on the take from gamblers.  However, when the scandal broke after the
   1920
   season, the White Sox, Red Sox and Yankees threatened to pull out of the American League and join a new 12-team National League.  The enlarged league would include a new team in Detroit unrelated to the Tigers, who were owned by Johnson loyalist Frank Navin.  However, Navin was in no mood for another war and persuaded the other five clubs to agree to appoint a new National Commission of non-baseball men.  Federal District Court Judge

   and two other Giants stars were implicated, only to be cleared by Landis, Johnson demanded that the Series be canceled.  He publicly criticized Landis for his handling of the affair, and Landis threatened to resign if the AL owners didn't rein Johnson in.  After the Series, the AL owners promised to remove Johnson from office if he stepped out of line again.  Johnson remained on good behavior for two years, even getting an extension of his contract to

   1927
   .  However, Johnson was in ill health at the time, and the owners decided to put him on an indefinite sabbatical instead.  Johnson tried to return in the spring and acted as if nothing had changed.  However, the situation had become untenable, and Johnson was forced to resign at the end of the season.
