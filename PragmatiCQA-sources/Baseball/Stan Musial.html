   Musial's career was perhaps most notable for its consistency.  His .331 career batting average ranks 30th; he batted .336 at home and .326 on the road. He batted .340 in day games and .320 at night.  Remarkably, Musial had exactly 1,815 career hits at home, and 1,815 hits on the road.  Musial has the most career home runs for a player who never won a single-season home run title.  In his September 1941 debut, Musial had two hits; after he got two hits in his final game, 22 years later, a sportswriter jokingly wrote, "He hasn't improved at all."

   Musial once said, "I consciously memorized the speed at which every pitcher in the league threw his fastball, curve, and slider; then, I'd pick up the speed of the ball in the first thirty feet of its flight and knew how it would move once it had crossed the plate."
