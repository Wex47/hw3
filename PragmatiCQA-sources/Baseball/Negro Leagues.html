Foster immediately turned the Giants into the team to beat.  He indoctrinated them to take the extra base, to play hit and run on nearly every pitch and to rattle the opposing pitcher by taking them deep into the count.  He studied the mechanics of his pitchers and could spot the smallest flaw, turning his average pitchers into learned craftsmen.  Foster also was able to turn around the business end of the team as well, by demanding and getting 40 percent of the gate instead of the 10 percent that Frank Leland was getting.

After the Monarchs had made the score 5-0 in the top of the eighth, the Grays scored four runs off of Paige (two earned) in the bottom of the eighth, but Gibson did not bat against Paige in that inning.  Paige retired the side in order (including Gibson for the second out) in the ninth.  He did not walk a man.  The final score was 8-4 Monarchs, Paige earning a save.

Having passed the test, Robinson signed the contract which stipulated that from then on, Robinson had no "written or moral obligations"
   to any other club.  By the inclusion of this clause, precedent was set that would raze the Negro leagues as a functional commercial enterprise.

Young players with enough talent were signed by major league teams, often without regard for any contracts that might have been signed with Negro League clubs.

   At first, the Hall of Fame planned a "separate but equal" display, which would be similar to the Ford Frick award for baseball commentators, in that this plan meant that the Negro League honorees would not be considered members of the Hall of Fame.
