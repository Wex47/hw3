   In baseball, "run" is also a term that may be used in anticipation of a run actually scoring, in terms of:
  </p>
  <ul key="e71bc26a-d6fd-44c0-96e5-82251613bbb2">
   <li key="460ef0c3-48bf-40d9-ab8d-d55063a3a3a5">
    Tying run - The runner in the on-deck circle, on base or at home plate that, if he scores, will tie the game
   </li>
   <li key="165b86ad-2d18-4cf3-a819-d9ad687fdd42">
    Go-ahead run - The runner in the on-deck circle, on base or at home plate that, if he scores, will give his team the lead. If the game is the second half of the final regulation inning, or in any extra inning, then this term is changed to "winning run."
   </li>
   <li key="0ce24f8a-1664-4c91-b459-76f761e9e070">
    Insurance run - The runner in the on-deck circle, on base or home plate that, if he scores, will put his team ahead by 2 runs. In some cases, additional runs past this may also be referred to as "insurance runs." This term is not used if the "winning run" is in play, as insurance runs are unnecessary at that point.
   </li>
  </ul>
