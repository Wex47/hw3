   . This book contains valuable information for coaches, parents, and players involved in youth sports. Dale wrote the book in response to the negative behavior that is increasing as a result of poor examples set by professional athletes. For example, steroid use among high school athletes reached an all-time high of one million users in 2006 due to the steroid scandals splashed in the headlines. This book is intended to voice a perspective of those who want to win at all costs. Stephen Keener, President and CEO of Little League Baseball, said, "Dale understands that the desire to win and pursuit of athletic dreams must be tempered with the fact that millions of kids will leave sports at a relatively young age and enter far more important arenas where it is absolutely necessary to have a foundation of honesty, dedication, and decency. I applaud Dale for undertaking this effort and encourage every Little League coach and parent to consider his thoughts before the next season begins. It will be well worth it." Included with each book is a 50-page insert which includes contributions from
