   was the most talented of them all. The Babe accumulated 2,213 RBIs over his career which ranks second in Major League History, and totaled 1,971 as a Yankee which is second best in the Yankees team history. Frazee traded Ruth to the Yankees in January of
   1920
   , citing Ruth's demand for a raise after being paid the highest salary in baseball, and despite owning the single season home run record at the time of the trade (hitting 29 home runs in 1919).
   Frazee also wished to aid the Yankees, as giving the Yankees a box office draw would strengthen a legal ally, and reduce the pressure he faced.
   Ruth was also regarded as a problem, a carouser. That would continue during his Yankees years, but the New York ownership was more tolerant, provided he brought fans and championships to the ballpark.

Barrow came on board after the 1920 season, and like many of the new Yankee players had previously been a part of the Red Sox organization, having managed the team since
   1918

   Throughout the late '70s, the race for the pennant often came to a close competition between the Yankees and the Red Sox, and for fans of both clubs, every game between the two became important and added to a rivalry that was often bitter and ruthless, with brawls frequently erupting between both players and fans from the two clubs.

The Yankees, however, won the division, clinching it in the second-to-last game of the season against the Red Sox. Alex Rodriguez won the American League Most Valuable Player award, becoming the first Yankee to win the award since Don Mattingly in 1985. Giambi was named

   After Torre's departure the Yankees signed former catcher Joe Girardi to a three-year contract to manage the club. The 2008 season was the last season played at Yankee Stadium. To celebrate the final year and history of Yankee Stadium, the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was played there on July 15, 2008. The final regular-season game at Yankee Stadium was played on September 21, 2008. After the game, Jeter addressed the crowd, thanking them for their support over the years, and urging them to "take the memories of this field, add them to the new memories that will come at the new Yankee Stadium and continue to pass them on from generation to generation." Despite multiple midseason roster moves, the team was hampered by injuries and missed the playoffs for the first time in 14 seasons.

   During the off-season, the Yankees retooled their roster with several star free agent acquisitions, including CC Sabathia, Mark Teixeira, and A. J. Burnett. At the beginning of the 2009 season, the Yankees opened the new Yankee Stadium. The Yankees set a major league record by playing error-free ball for 18 consecutive games from May 14 to June 1, 2009. The Yankees finished first in the AL East. In the ALDS they defeated the Twins in a sweep before moving on to the ALCS where the Yankees defeated Angels in six games. They defeated the defending champions, the Philadelphia Phillies, in Game 6 of the World Series 7–3, to take the series 4–2, their 27th World Series title.

   The 2010 season featured the rivalry between the Yankees and Red Sox being revived to start and end the season. The Yankees and the Red Sox started and finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. This was the first time since 1950 this had happened. In June, Joe Torre's Dodgers played games against the Yankees for the first time since he became manager of the Dodgers, with the Yankees taking two out of three games in the series. During the 2010 All-Star break, Pennsylvania announcer Bob Sheppard and principal owner George Steinbrenner died. Eight days later, another longtime Yankee icon, former player and manager Ralph Houk, died. The Yankees won the American League Wild Card. They swept the Minnesota Twins in the 2010 American League Division Series, but lost to the Texas Rangers in the 2010 American League Championship Series 4 games to 2.
In a 22–9 win over the Athletics at home on August 25, 2011, the Yankees became the first team in Major League history to hit three grand slams in a single game. They were hit by Robinson Canó, Russell Martin, and Curtis Granderson. The Yankees won the AL East title for the second time in three seasons, finishing with 97 wins and took home field throughout the AL postseason. However, they were defeated by the Tigers in five games in the 2011 American League Division Series.
The Yankees again finished the season with the AL's best record at 95–67. They faced the Orioles in the 2012 American League Division Series. In Game 3, Raúl Ibañez became the oldest player to hit two home runs in a game, the oldest to hit a walk-off homer, the first substitute position player in a postseason game to hit two home runs, and the first to hit two home runs in the 9th inning or later in a postseason game, in the Yankees' 3–2 win. The Yankees would defeat the Orioles in five games. But in the 2012 American League Championship Series, the Yankees lost to the Tigers again, this time in a four-game sweep, which was compounded with a struggling offense and a season-ending injury to Derek Jeter.
On April 12, 2013, the Yankees made their second triple play ever in a home game playing the Baltimore Orioles. It was scored as 4-6-5-6-5-3-4, the first triple play of its kind in baseball history.

The NY logo was in white. Gabe liked them.  I nearly fainted.  Although the drab gray road uniforms were not exciting, with the plain NEW YORK across the chest, they were just as much the Yankees' look as were the home uniforms.  I think my dramatic disdain helped saved (sic) the day and saved the Yankees from wearing those awful pajamas on the field.

   The Creatures are famed for the "Roll Call".  In the top of the first inning, when the Yankees are on the field and the pitcher is readying to throw the first pitch, they all stand and begin clapping.  Then, after the pitch is thrown, a group of guys wave their hands down to hush the crowd, and one man named "Vinny" shouts out the name of the center fielder (ie: "Yo, Johnny!"), and then the whole group begins chanting his name (ie: "JOH-nee DA-mon, clap, clap, clap clap clap").  They then do the rest of the players on the defensive lineup (CF-LF-RF-1B-2B-SS-3B, in that order) except for the pitcher and catcher (although there have been exceptions)  They do not stop until the player has responded in some way, usually with a wave or point.  After they've gone through the lineup, the group turned to the left, chanting at the right field box seats "Box Seats Suck!" until finally the chanting dissipates.  When a player is replaced in a defensive position (not counting pitcher) the replacement is also given the same chant.

   Because of rowdiness and the fact that many families now sit in the more affordable bleachers, alcoholic beverages were banned from the bleachers in 2000.  This does not lessen the spirit of the Creatures, and may still be getting away with clandestine drinking
   .  Because of this, the fans in the box seats often retaliate to the Creatures' mockings by chanting "We've got beer!"  This chant is often referred to (or sometimes caused by) the Creatures chanting "Alcoholics!"

  <p key="8a0969ef-dd0d-413b-9686-24fd7a98f086">
   The Creatures are popular with the crowd and are known for their strict allegiance to the Yankees and their extreme hatred for the Mets and the Red Sox.  They are often merciless to any fan of either of these teams that dares to sit in the bleachers.  They also enjoy taunting the opposing team's right fielder.  Many of the members attend almost every home game, sitting in section 39, cheering on the team in their own inimitable way.

   In 1997, Cablevision bought MSG Network, home of the Yankees and became owner of the TV rights to all 7 MLB, NBA and NHL teams in New York City. This monopoly allowed MSG to use such tactics as putting games on channels that were not available to many Time Warner Cable or Comcast customers. In 1999, the Yankees and the New Jersey Nets formed a partnership and discussed their options. Due to the success of the Yankees in the late 90's, giving their brand name a boost, they decided to leave and form a new network.

  <p key="aa98834a-8cdd-4dfa-af02-c309970b33d4">
   The Yankees Entertainment and Sports (YES) Network launched in 2002 and served as the home of the New York Yankees during the baseball season and the New Jersey Nets for the rest of the year, giving it live sports coverage for the entire year. It also offered original programming such as Yankeeography, CenterStage and the re-airing of older games under the name Yankees Classics. The partnership between the Yankees and Nets ended in 2003, but the Nets still remain the part of YES they were since it's beginning. YES has also begun airing programming for the New York Giants and Manchester United.

   Lou Gehrig's number 4 was the first number retired in MLB history, right after Gehrig left baseball on July 4, 1939 and it was apparent that he would not live much longer. His speech at Yankee Stadium that day is known as one of the most moving moments in baseball history.

The other Major League Baseball teams had placed Robinson's 42 among their retired numbers in their home parks even if they still had players wearing the number.

Oddly, the official website of the Yankees lists Jackie Robinson's 42 among the Yankees retired numbers, along with biographical information just as the others are.
