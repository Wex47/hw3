   umpire
   believes a pitcher has thrown at a batter intentionally, a warning is issued to the pitcher and the
   managers
   of both teams.  From that point on, any pitch thrown at a batter can cause the pitcher and the manager of the offending team to be ejected immediately from the game.  Serious offenses such as a ball thrown at the head (called a

   Oftentimes, if a player is acting rude or unsportsmanlike, or having an extraordinarily good day, the pitcher may intentionally hit the batter, disguising it as a pitch that accidentally slipped his control.  Managers may also order a pitcher to throw such a pitch (sometimes called a "plunking"). These pitches are often aimed at the lower back and slower than normal, designed to send a message more than anything else.  The opposing team usually hits a batter in retaliation for this act.  The plunkings generally end there because of umpire warnings, but in some cases things can get out of hand, and sometimes they lead to the batter
