   Ichiro made his Pacific League debut in
   1992
   at the age of 18, but he spent most of his first two seasons in the
   farm system
   because of his manager's refusal to accept Ichiro's unorthodox swing. The swing, nicknamed 'pendulum' because of the pendulum-like motion of his leg, shifting the weight forward as he swung the bat, was considered to go against conventional hitting theory.  Even though he hit a home run off

   , Ichiro was sent back to the farm system on that very day.  In
   1994
   , he benefited from the arrival of a new manager who played him every day in the second spot of the lineup.  He was eventually moved to the leadoff spot for the Blue Wave, where his immediate productivity dissolved any misgivings about his uncoventional swing.  He set a Japanese single-season record with 210 hits in 130 games for a then-Pacific League record .385 batting average and won the first of a record seven consecutive batting titles. He also hit 13
   home runs
   and had 29
   stolen bases
   , helping him to earn his first of three straight Pacific League MVP (Most Valuable Player) awards.

   , "Suzuki" on the back of his uniform. Suzuki is the second most common family name in Japan, and his manager introduced the idea as a publicity stunt to help create a new image for what had been a relatively weak team, as well as a way to distinguish their rising star. Initially, Ichiro disliked the practice and was embarrassed by it; "Ichiro" was a household name by the end of the season and he was flooded with endorsement offers.

   In
   1995
   Ichiro led the Blue Wave to their first Pacific League pennant in 12 years. In addition to his second batting title, he led the league with 80 RBI (runs batted in), hit 25 home runs, and stole 49 bases. By this time, the Japanese press had begun calling him the "Human Batting Machine." The following year, with Ichiro winning his third straight MVP award, the team defeated the Central League champion,
   Yomiuri Giants
   ,  in the Japan Series. Following the
   1996
   season, playing in an exhibition series against a visiting team of Major League All-Stars kindled Ichiro's desire to travel to the United States to play in the Major Leagues.

   In 2000, Ichiro was still a year away from being eligible for free agency, but the Blue Wave were no longer among Japan's best teams. They would probably not be able to afford to keep him and would lose him without compensation in another year, and allowed him to negotiate with Major League clubs. Ichiro used  the

   Ichiro signed a three-year, $14 million contract with the Mariners and became the first Japanese position player in the Major Leagues.

   , 2000, Ichiro was acquired by the Seattle Mariners for a contract worth roughly $14 million. Ichiro's move to the United States was viewed with great interest because he was the first Japanese position player to play regularly for a Major League Baseball team. Up to that point, only

   from Japan had been playing in the United States and, in the same way that many Japanese teams had considered the 18-year-old Ichiro too small to draft in 1992, many in the US believed he was too frail to succeed against Major League pitching or endure the longer 162-game season.  Ichiro made an auspicious debut his first week in the MLB, and revealed his tremendous throwing arm, by gunning down at third base the

   Ichiro wears the number 51 which he was issued by the Mariners as he had no preference for a number when he joined the club. He was initially hesitant when he was issued the number. To avoid insulting its former owner,

   , Ichiro forwarded a personal message to the Big Unit promising not to “bring shame” to the uniform.
Not only did he prove he belonged, Ichiro had a remarkable 2001 season, accumulating 242 hits (the most by any player since
   1930
   as well as a rookie record) and leading the league with a .350 batting average and 56 stolen bases.

Flight agencies also benefited from Ichiro, as many Ichiro fans were flying in and out of the country just to see him play.

   in the inaugural
   World Baseball Classic
   in March of 2006.  During the March 15 Japan-Korea game Ichiro was booed by a few spectators during every at-bat, reportedly in response to a previous statement that he wanted "to beat South Korea so badly, that the South Koreans won't want to play Japan for another 30 years."
   That, however, was an incorrect translation mostly spread to the public through ESPN.  Ichiro was variously quoted as saying "I want to win in a way that the opponent would think, 'we cannot catch up with Japan for the coming 30 years.'" as well as "I want to beat the teams in the Asia Round so badly they'll never think of beating Japan for the coming 30 years. The fans can expect a lot from us."   However, Korea beat Japan twice out of three times. Japan would later beat Korea in the playoffs and win the tournament after defeating Cuba in the finals, 10-6.
   Ichiro was one of only two Major League Baseball players on Team Japan, the other being reliever
   Akinori Otsuka
   .  Throughout the course of the tournament, Ichiro provided twelve hits, seven runs, four stolen bases, and one home run.
