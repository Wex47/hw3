   gained new significance when baseball analysts realized that it combined with

   developed perhaps the most widespread means of combining slugging and on-base average:

   . "OPS" simply stands for "on-base plus slugging", and is a simple addition of the two values. While less accurate than SLOB and Runs Created, OPS is extremely easy to calculate, and has become the unofficial shorthand form of player evaluation in recent years.
