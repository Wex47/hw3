  <p key="15e46095-51df-4810-b780-1cc72e61c085">
   Sandy Koufax was born in Brooklyn to Evelyn and Jack Braun.
   He grew up in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn. His parents divorced when he was three years old; when he was nine his mother remarried, and Koufax took the surname of her new husband Irving.
   Shortly after his mother's remarriage, the family moved to the Long Island suburb of Rockville Centre; when he graduated from ninth grade, they moved back to the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
  </p>
  <p key="8546f0bb-cc1b-4bcf-854f-0df6888c5d05">
   Koufax attended Brooklyn's Lafayette High School. While there, he was better known for basketball and than for baseball. When he started high school, school sports were not available because the New York school teachers were refusing to supervise extracurricular activities without monetary compensation. As an alternative to school sports, Koufax started playing basketball for a local Jewish Community Center team. After the labor action was settled, he played for the high school basketball team. During his senior year he became team captain and ranked second in his division in scoring, with 165 points in 10 games.
  </p>
  <p key="2b86393d-69c6-4cdf-9632-d6fbc747ea99">
   While attending high school, Koufax also played baseball. In 1951, at the age of 15, Koufax began playing in a local youth baseball league known as the "Ice Cream League." He started out as a left-handed catcher, and the next year moved to first base; he also played first base for the Lafayette High School team. While playing for Lafayette, he was spotted throwing the ball around the infield by Milt Laurie, the father of two of Koufax's teammates and coach of the Coney Island Sports League's Parkviews. Laurie recognized that Koufax might be able to pitch and recruited the 17-year old Koufax to pitch for the Parkviews.

   The next day, Koufax was pitching for the "B team" in Orlando. His teammate, Ed Palmquist, missed the flight, so Koufax was told he would need to pitch at least seven innings. In the first inning, Koufax walked the bases loaded on 12 straight pitches. Sherry told him, as he'd been told before, to take something off the ball to get better control. Koufax finally listened and struck out the side. By the time he came out of the game after seven innings, Koufax had struck out eight batters, walked five and given up no hits.

   That same season, Koufax's pitching hand was injured. In a batting appearance in April, Koufax had been jammed by a pitch from Earl Francis. Soon a numbness developed in Koufax's index finger on his left hand, and the finger became cold and white. Koufax was pitching better than ever before, however, so he ignored the problem hoping that it would clear up.  By July his entire hand was becoming numb and he had to leave some games early.  In a start in Cincinnati, his finger split open after one inning. After seeing a vascular specialist, it was determined that Koufax had a crushed artery in his palm. Ten days of experimental medicine successfully reopened the artery. Koufax finally was able to pitch again in September, when the team was locked in a tight pennant race with the Giants. Trying to get back into shape after the long layoff, Koufax was ineffective in three appearances as the Giants caught the Dodgers at the end of the regular season, forcing a three-game playoff.

   , Koufax awoke to find that his entire left arm was black and blue from hemorrhaging. Koufax returned to Los Angeles to consult with Kerlan, who advised Koufax that he'd be lucky to be able to pitch once a week. Kerlan also told Koufax that he would eventually lose full use of his arm. Koufax agreed not to throw at all between games‚Äîa resolution that lasted only one start. To get himself through the games he pitched in, Koufax resorted to Empirin with codeine for the pain (which he took every night and sometimes during the fifth inning) and Butazolidin for inflammation.  He would also apply capsaicin-based Capsolin ointment (called "atomic balm" by baseball players) before each game, and then soak his arm in a tub of ice.

   Drysdale responded that Bavasi did the same thing with him, using Koufax against him. Drysdale's first wife, Ginger Drysdale, suggested that they negotiate together to get what they wanted. They demanded $1 million dollars, divided equally over the next three years, or $167,000 each for the next three seasons. Both players were represented by an entertainment lawyer, J.

   At the beginning of his career, Koufax worked with coaches to eliminate his tendency to "tip" pitches (i.e. reveal which pitch was coming due to variations in his wind-up). Late in his career, and especially as his arm problems continued, this variation‚Äîusually in the position he held his hands at the top of the wind-up‚Äîwas even more pronounced. Good hitters could often predict what pitch was coming, but were still unable to hit it. Willie Mays said, "I knew every pitch he was going to throw and still I couldn't hit him."
