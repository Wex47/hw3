   Winning 300 games is a feat that is much more difficult to achieve now compared to the past due to the increased use of relief pitching, which has reduced the number of decisions for starting pitchers. In addition, Maddux has pitched his entire career in the era of the 5-man rotation, in which starters are given fewer starts per season. For that reason, some baseball historians have said he may be the last pitcher to achieve
   300 career wins
   for decades, if not ever, although the recent return to form by his former

   , Maddux relies on location rather than power, having lost his already modest velocity over the years.
   Baseball Hall of Famer
   Wade Boggs
   said of Maddux, "It seems like he's inside your mind with you.  When he knows you're not going to swing, he throws a straight one. He sees into the future. It's like he has a crystal ball hidden inside his glove."
   Dwight Gooden
   once commended Maddux, saying, "You wish there was another league he could get called up to."
   Joe Morgan
   once said that "Greg Maddux could put a baseball through a Life Saver." Maddux was also remarkable for the late movement on his pitches, which, combined with his superb command, made him one of the most effective groundball pitchers in history; hitters were often unable to make solid contact with his pitches.
