   across town, consulted Walsh in setting the park's field dimensions.  Choosing a design that would favor himself and other White Sox pitchers, rather than hitters, Walsh not only made Comiskey Park a "pitcher's park" for its entire 80-year history, but he can be said to be the man who "built" Comiskey Park to a greater degree than

   , "The House That Ruth Built": While the money the Yankees were making due to fans coming to see Ruth made building the Stadium possible, and the short distance to the right-field fence may have been chosen with Ruth in mind, Ruth did not choose that distance.  Walsh appears to have been the man who chose what kind of playing conditions Comiskey Park would have.

   referred to Walsh's use of a pitch that would later be outlawed: "Big Ed Walsh.  Great big, strong, good-looking fellow.  He threw a

   . Some claim that he came into spring training around this time in poorer physical shape than other members of the White Sox pitching staff, and his pride led him to try to keep up with the other pitchers in terms of pitch speed before getting into adequate shape, thereby causing damage to his pitching arm. By
   1916
   his arm was dead. He wanted a year off, but
   Charles Comiskey
   released him instead. He attempted a comeback with the
