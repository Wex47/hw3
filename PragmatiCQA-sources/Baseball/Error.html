    error

   is the act, in the judgment of the
   official scorer
   , of a fielder misplaying a ball in a manner that allows a
   batter
   or
   baserunner
   to reach one or more additional bases, when such an advance should have been prevented given ordinary effort by the fielder. It is also an error when a fielder muffs a foul fly to prolong the time at bat of a batter, whether the batter subsequently reaches first base or is put out.

   An error does not count as a
   hit
   unless, in the scorer's judgment, the batter would have reached first base safely but one or more of the additional base(s) reached was the result of the fielder's mistake.  In that case, the play will be scored both as a hit (for the number of bases the fielders should have limited the batter to)

   an error.  Similarly, a batter does not receive credit for a RBI when runs score on an error, unless the scorer rules that a run would have scored even if the fielder had not made a mistake.  For example, if a batter hits a ball to the outfield for what should be a
   sacrifice fly
   , and the outfielder drops the ball for an error, the batter will still receive credit for the sacrifice fly and the run batted in.

   If a play should have resulted in a

   Because a batted ball hit on the fly into foul territory, with the batting team having no runner(s) on base, and a fielder misplaying such ball for an error, it is possible for a team on the winning side of a

   There is a curious loophole in the rules on errors for catchers.  If a catcher makes a "wild throw" in an attempt to prevent a stolen base, and the runner is safe, the catcher is not charged with an error, even if it could be argued that the runner would have been put out with "ordinary effort."  There is therefore sort of a "no fault" condition for the catcher attempting to prevent a steal. If the runner takes an additional base due to the wild throw, an error

   Traditionally, the number of errors was a statistic used to quantify the skill of a fielder.  
Research has shown that the error rate is higher when the quality of fielding is suspect, i.e., the performance of an expansion team in its first year, or the fielding done by replacement players during World War II, and is lower when playing conditions are better, e.g. on artificial turf and during night games.
   Errors are more common in
   Minor league baseball
   , in which players are still learning the mechanics of the gae.

   However, fans and analysts have questioned the usefulness and significance of errors as a metric for fielding skill. Notably, mental misjudgments, such as failure to cover a base or attempting a

   when such a play is not available, are not considered errors.

  <p key="ea69cf8b-a101-4740-b348-617085fb9fc1">
   A more subtle, though more significant objection to the error, as
   sabermetricians
   have noted, is more conceptual—in order for a fielder to be charged with an error, he must have done something right by being in the correct place to be able to attempt the play. A poor fielder may "avoid" many errors simply by being unable to reach batted or thrown balls that a better fielder could successfully reach. Thus, it is possible that a poor fielder will have fewer errors than an otherwise better fielder.

   In recent times, official scorers have made some attempt to take a fielder's supposed "extraordinary" effort or positioning into account when judging whether the play should have been successful given ordinary effort. However, this still leaves a statistic, such as
   fielding percentage
   , that is based on errors as a dubious way to compare the defensive abilities of players.
