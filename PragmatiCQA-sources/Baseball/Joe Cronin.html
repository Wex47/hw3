   got a steal of a deal on Cronin. When Engel first spotted Cronin playing in Kansas City, "I knew I was watching a great player. I bought Cronin at a time he was hitting .221. When I told Clark Griffith what I had done, he screamed, "You paid $7,500 for that bum? Well, you didn't buy him for me. You bought him for yourself. He's not my ballplayer - he's yours. You keep him and don't either you or Cronin show up at the ballpark." Cronin led the Senators ball club to the 1933 World Series and even married Griffith's niece, Mildred Robertson.

   its roster (Cronin once passed on signing a young
