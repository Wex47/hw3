  <p key="6cce7c18-ef0d-4ee2-9595-6a5afeef546a">
   There is some debate as to how Mays became known as the "Say Hey Kid". One story is that Barney Kremenko, a writer for the New York Journal heard Mays blurt "'Say who,' 'Say what,' 'Say where,' 'Say hey.'" As a result, Kremenko penned him the 'Say Hey Kid' in 1951.

  <p key="a39199af-ee4d-48bb-b51c-fb543af8d268">
   The other story is that Jimmy Cannon created the nickname. According to this account, When Mays arrived in the majors, he did not know everyone's name. "You see a guy, you say, 'Hey, man. Say hey, man,' " Mays said. "Ted was the 'Splinter'. Joe was 'Joltin' Joe'. Stan was 'The Man'. I guess I hit a few home runs, and they said there goes the 'Say Hey Kid.'"
