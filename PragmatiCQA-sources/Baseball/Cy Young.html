   Waddell had picked an inauspicious time to issue his challenge. Young's perfect game was the centerpiece of a sterling pitching streak. Young set major league records for both the most consecutive scoreless innings pitched, and for the most consecutive innings without allowing a hit; the latter record still stands at 24.3 innings, or 73 hitless batters. Even after allowing a hit, Young's scoreless streak reached 45 shutout innings, a record not broken until 1968.

Young pitched 13 consecutive scoreless innings before he gave up a pair of unearned runs in the final inning.  Young did not walk a batter, and was later quoted: "For my part, I think it was the greatest game of ball I ever took part in."

   , Young pitched the third no-hitter of his career. Three months past his 41st birthday, Cy Young was the oldest pitcher to record a no-hitter, a record which would stand 82 years until 43-year-old Nolan Ryan surpassed the feat. Only a leadoff walk kept Young from his second perfect game; after that runner was caught stealing, no other batter reached base. Young was now the second-oldest player in either league, but was still one of the AL's elite pitchers.  One month before his no-hitter, he'd allowed just one single while facing 28 batters.

  <p key="85fd1606-f238-415c-b137-8cd27906ca73">
   For fourteen consecutive years, from 1893 through 1906, Young led his league in fewest walks per nine innings thirteen times, and finished second the other season. Only twice in his 22-year career did Young finish lower than 6th in the category.  Although the
   WHIP
   ratio was not calculated until well after Young's death, Young was the retroactive league leader in this category seven times, and was second or third another seven times.

  <p key="5c9a5247-0457-499b-ba72-94efd20912ab">
   In addition to his peerless control, Young was also a workhorse who avoided injury.  For nineteen consecutive years, from 1891 through 1909, Cy Young was in his leagues' top ten for innings pitched; in fourteen of the seasons, he was in the top five.  Not until 1900, a decade into his career, did Young pitch two consecutive incomplete games.

   By habit, Young restricted his practice throws in
   spring training
   .  "I figured the old arm had just so many throws in it," said Young, "and there wasn't any use wasting them."  Young once described his approach before a game:
  </p>
  <p key="afbedefd-93a9-4b01-a40f-c354ca556c3c">
   Young also credited his offseason farming chores, including wood chopping, with keeping his pitching strength in good shape until he was 44.
   Even at the time of his retirement, his arm was healthy, but Young had gained weight and was unable to field his position anymore.
   In three of his last four years, he was the oldest player in the league.
