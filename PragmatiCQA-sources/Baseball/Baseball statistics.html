   Traditionally, statistics like batting average for batters (the number of hits divided by the number of at bats) and earned run average (approximately the number of runs given up by a pitcher per nine innings) have governed the statistical world of baseball. However, the advent of

  <p key="53a56dd5-7935-43f9-b491-4e6eb2e7d6ff">
   Some
   sabermetric
   statistics have entered the mainstream baseball world. Among statistics that measure a batter's overall performance,
   On-base plus slugging
   (OPS) is one of the easiest to calculate. It adds the hitter's

   </a>
   (number of times reached base -by any means- divided by total plate appearances) to his or her
   slugging percentage
   (
   total bases
   divided by at bats).  Some argue that the OPS formula is flawed and that more weight should be shifted towards OBP (on base percentage).  Regardless, OPS still stands as the most direct means of evaluating a hitter's performance using readily available statistics.
  </p>
  <p key="048b479e-7fe7-43a7-933a-533946d3d058">
   OPS is also useful when determining a pitcher's level of success.  'Opponent On-base Plus Slugging' (OOPS) is becoming a popular way to evaluating a pitcher's actual performance.  When analyzing a pitcher's statistics, some useful categories to consider are: K/9 (strikeouts per nine innings), K/BB (strikeouts per walk), and HR/9.  WHIP (walks+hits per inning pitched) and OOPS (opponent on-base plus slugging) are popular statistics; however, if DIPS theory is correct, a pitcher has little control over these statistics.  When viewing all these categories together, you gain a much clearer picture of the pitcher's success level (as opposed to simply considering W-L and ERA).  Though not widely used, statistics like FIP (Fielding Independent Pitching) can be used as a predictor of a pitcher's "true" success, with the impact of his fielders removed.

    Defense-Independent Pitching Statistics

   . These statistics, such as Defense-Independent ERA (dERA), attempt to evaluate a pitcher solely according to those events governed solely by the pitcher's performance, regardless of the strength of the defensive players behind him.
  </p>
  <p key="82399538-6d9b-48e2-8f14-440da1bf0732">
   Also important are all of those statistics in certain in-game situations. For example, a certain hitter's ability to hit left-handed pitchers might cause his manager to give him more chances to face lefties. Other hitters may have a history of success against a given pitcher (or vice versa), and the manager may use this information to engineer a favourable matchup.
