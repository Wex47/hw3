The Foundation sought to bring tourists to Cooperstown, which had been doubly damaged by the Great Depression, which decimated the local tourist trade, and Prohibition, which was devastating to the local hops industry. A legend that U.S. Civil War hero
   Abner Doubleday
   invented baseball in Cooperstown was instrumental in the early marketing of the Hall, though in fact the truth of the story is doubted by some.

   , which is now composed of living Hall of Famers and recipients of the two major awards. Five years after retirement, any player with 10 years of major league experience, who passes a screening committee (which removes from consideration players of clearly lesser qualification) is eligible to be elected by BBWAA members with 10 years' membership or more. From a final ballot typically including 25-40 candidates, each writer may vote for up to 10 players; until the late 1950s, voters were advised to cast votes for the maximum 10 candidates. Any player named on 75% or more of all ballots cast is elected. A player who is named on fewer than 5% of ballots is dropped from future elections. In some instances, the screening committee had restored their names to later ballots, but in the mid-1990s, dropped players were made permanently ineligible for Hall of Fame consideration, even by the Veterans Committee. A 2001 change in the election procedures restored the eligibility of these dropped players; while their names will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, they may be considered by the Veterans Committee.

In 2005 the Hall completed a study on African American players between the late 19th century and the integration of the major leagues in 1947, and conducted a special election for such players in February 2006; seventeen figures from the Negro Leagues were chosen in that election, in addition to the eighteen previously selected. The Committee was widely criticized for failing to elect

While few of the BBWAA selections have been particularly controversial, prior to its recent restructuring the Veterans Committee had, at times, seemed to pass over the most worthy candidates in order to enshrine contemporaries and teammates of the committee members.

   The revamped Veterans Committee has held two elections to date—in
   2003
   for both players and non-players, and
   2005
   for players only. No individual was elected either time; some observers are already starting to doubt whether the new Veterans Committee will ever elect a player, or whether the Committee members – most of whom are Hall members – are reluctant to elect new candidates, in the hope of heightening the value of their own selection

   Pete Rose
   . Jackson and Rose were both banned from baseball for life for actions related to gambling on their own teams - Jackson was determined to have cooperated with those who conspired to lose the
   1919 World Series
   on purpose, and Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent spot on the ineligible list in return for

   when he was their manager in the 1980s. (Baseball's Rule 21, prominently posted in every clubhouse locker room, mandates permanent banishment from the sport for having a gambling interest of any sort on a game in which a player or manager is directly involved.) While Jackson and Rose had outstanding playing careers that would usually merit Hall of Fame induction, the Hall of Fame disallows election of anyone on the permanent suspension list. (Many others have been permanently suspended, but none have Hall of Fame qualifications on the level of Jackson or Rose. A select few, such as

   The Hall has also recently changed its stance regarding team membership. Although all the teams for which a player played are usually listed in the text of the plaque, most are depicted wearing the cap of one specific team. Before the current trend of frequent free agency, this was not controversial, since players of Hall of Fame quality often played most of their career with one team. As free agents began to be inducted, it was the player's choice which cap they would wear, and the players did not always make the most popular choice. For instance,

   ), the Hall decided to change the policy. Although the decision-making process would be a mutual responsibility, the Hall - not the players - would have the final say in such matters.
   Gary Carter
   was the first to test this policy; he won his only championship with the

   Wade Boggs
   was in a similar situation; he won his only championship as a member of the 1996
