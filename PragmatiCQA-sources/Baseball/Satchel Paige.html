    When asked about the year Paige was born, his mother said, "I can't rightly recall whether Leroy was first born or my fifteenth." On a separate occasion, she confided to a sportswriter that her son was actually three years older than he thought he was. A few years later she had another epiphany—he was, she said, two years older. She knew this because she wrote it down in her Bible. When Paige wrote his memoirs in 1962, he was not convinced about this. He wrote, "Seems like Mom's Bible would know, but she ain't never shown me the Bible. Anyway, she was in her nineties when she told the reporter that and sometimes she tended to forget things."

    Paige could not return to the NNL because he was banned from the league for the 1935 season by Greenlee when he jumped to the Bismarck team.  Paige turned to J. Leslie Wilkinson and the Kansas City Monarchs.  Wilkinson, risking the wrath of Greenlee, was elated to bring Paige aboard.  Paige stayed with the Monarchs through the end of the year.

    Paige, at the demand of his wife, returned to Pittsburgh where Greenlee acquiesced to Paige’s salary demands and gave him a $600-per-month contract, by far the highest in the Negro Leagues.  In order to get Wilkinson not to sign Paige again, Greenlee agreed that the NNL would recognize a competing league the following season, to be made up of Midwest teams and overseen by Wilkinson.  That would lead to the renewing of the

    Three games into the season, Paige’s arm went dead.  He could barely lift his arm, much less pitch.  In the final game of the season, Paige was matched up against Dihigo.  Paige relied on throwing junkballs while Dihigo was throwing blistering fastballs.  Through six innings, Paige threw from every angle from overhead to crossfire, even underhanded.  He was able to hit the corners of the plate for strikes and the batters, always wary of his fastball, couldn’t dig in properly and take advantage of his lack of velocity.  Finally in the seventh, his arm gave out completely.  With the game scoreless, Paige gave up a hit and two walks.  Rearing back to throw a fast ball, he uncorked a wild pitch that resulted in a run scoring.  He managed to retire the side by going back to throwing junkballs.

    , a teammate of Paige, Paige realized that it was for the better that he himself wasn’t the
    first black
    in major league baseball.  Robinson started in the minors, an insult that Paige would not have tolerated.  By integrating baseball in the minor leagues first, the white major league players got the chance to “get used to” the idea of playing alongside black players.  Understanding that, Paige said in his autobiography that, “Signing Jackie like they did still hurt me deep down.  I’d been the guy who’d started all that big talk about letting us in the big time.  I’d been the one who’d opened up the major league parks to colored teams.  I’d been the one who the white boys wanted to go barnstorming against.”  Paige, and all other black players, knew that quibbling about the choice of the first black player in the major leagues would do nothing productive, so, despite his inner feelings, Paige said of Robinson, “He’s the greatest colored player I’ve ever seen.”
