   opened the door for Eckersley to move into the closer's role.  He saved 16 games in 1987 and then established himself as a dominant closer in 1988 by recording a league-leading 45 saves.  He recorded saves in each of the four games the A's won in sweeping the Red Sox in the 1988 AL Championship Series, and in the
   1989 World Series
   he secured the victory in Game Two, and then earned the save in the final game of the Series, as the A's swept the San Francisco Giants in four games.

   Eckersley was the most dominant closer in the game from 1988 to
   1992
   , finishing first in the A.L. in saves twice, second two other times, and third once.  He saved 220 games during the five years and never posted an ERA higher than 2.96. He gave up five earned runs in the entire
   1990
   season, resulting in a microscopic 0.61 ERA. Eckersley's control, which had always been above average even when he was not otherwise pitching well, became his trademark; he walked only three batters in 57.7 innings in
   1989
   , four batters in 73.3 innings in 1990, and nine batters in 76 innings in 1991. In his 1990 season, Eckersley became the only relief pitcher in baseball history to have more saves than baserunners allowed (48 SV, 41 H, 4 BB, 0 HBP).

Eckersley's 5-year stretch from 1988-1992 is arguably the best 5-year stretch ever recorded by a relief pitcher in regular season play.

   . However, even in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a closer was considered a weaker and less valuable pitcher than a top starter. Pitchers started games and if they were real men, they finished them (or so the mentality went). Relievers were either "firemen" (pitchers who only came into pressure-packed situations, with runners on and few out late in a game, and thus "put out the fire"), or pitchers not good enough to start; the vast majority of relievers were considered to be the latter.

   The A's used Eckersley almost exclusively for the ninth inning and inserted him regardless of the pressure or game situation. Instead of being a fireman or a mop-up man, Eckersley became a one-inning pitcher. Starters were no longer expected to finish games; there was another pitcher who was coming into the game in the ninth inning, no matter what. Although the idea of a dedicated closer was hardly new (

   Eckersley's incredible short-term dominance of the position was perhaps the most influential aspect of this popularization. He was seen to shut down a game after the eighth inning; he was fresh, cocky, and usually hit his spots. He pointed his finger at an opposing batter after a whiff or a ground out (something Eck was known for because of his great sinker, a pitch he primarily developed after becoming a closer) or at the opposing dugout, and his glare became well-known after he and Boston's

   After Eckersley, every team wanted a pitcher who would end a game after  eight innings, save their starters from overextending themselves, and give their fans something exciting to look forward to late in the game. Although the value of a closer is still debatable, Eckersley's influence is indisputable; by 2006, the notion of a team without a dedicated closer seemed as ridiculous as a pre-Eckersley team with one.  In fact, a
   complete game
   by a starter is now as rare if not rarer than a
   save
   by a relief pitcher was 40 or 50 years ago. Eckersley had exactly 100 complete games as a starter, making him the only pitcher with 100 complete games and 300 saves in his career.
