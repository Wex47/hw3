   In 1947, Major League Baseball implemented the
   bonus rule
   , a restriction aimed at reducing player salaries, as well as keeping wealthier teams from monopolizing the player market.
   In its most restrictive form, it forbade any team which gave an amateur a signing bonus of more than $4,000 from assigning that player to a minor league affiliate for two seasons.  If the player was removed from the major league roster, he became a free agent.  The controversial legislation was repealed twice, only to be re-instituted.

   Originally, three separate drafts were held each year. The June draft, which was by far the largest, involved new high school graduates, as well as college seniors who had just finished their seasons.  A second draft was held in January for high school and college players who graduated in the winter. Finally, there was a draft in August for players who participated in amateur summer leagues.
   The August draft was eliminated after only two years, while the January draft lasted until 1986.

   Early on, the majority of players drafted came directly from high school.  Between 1967 and 1971, only seven college players were chosen in the first round of the June draft.
   However, the college players who were drafted outperformed their high school counterparts by what statistician
   Bill James
   called "a laughably huge margin."
   In 1978, a majority of draftees had played college baseball, and by 2002, the number rose above sixty percent.

   Increasingly, teams drafted based on whether or not a player was likely to sign for a particular amount of money, rather than on his talent.  This became known as a "signability pick."  Before the 1992 draft, team owners unilaterally decided to extend the period of time a team retained negotiating rights to a player from one year to five.  In effect, the rule prohibited a high school draftee from attending college and re-entering the draft after his junior or senior seasons.  The

   filed a legal challenge, but Major League Baseball argued that, since the Players Association did not represent amateur players, it was not necessary for the union to agree to the change.
   An arbitrator ultimately decided that any change to draft articles must be negotiated with the Players Association.

   Prior to 2007, a team retained the rights to sign a selected player until one week prior to the next draft, or until the player enters, or returns to, a four-year college on a full-time basis.  Starting in 2007, the deadline for signing a drafted player is August 15.  A selected player who enters a junior college cannot be signed until the conclusion of the school's baseball season.  A player who is drafted and does not sign with the club that selected him may be drafted again at a future year's draft, so long as the player is eligible for that year's draft.  A club may not select a player again in a subsequent year, unless the player has consented to the re-selection.

In the one-week period before any draft, which is called the "closed period", the general rule is that no club may sign a new player.

   Teams can earn Compensatory picks in the draft based on departing free agents.  Free Agents are ranked by the Elias Sports Bureau based on their previous two years of playing, and against players of similar positions.  Players are categorized as either Class A or Class B, or they fall into the category of all other players.  Below is a description of each free agent class and the compensation the free agent's former team received when the player signs with a different team.
  </p>
  <p key="bab2b689-e94e-4e5a-a29d-3568a1741f23">
   • A Class A free agent is ranked in the top 20 percent of players at his position. A team that signs a Type A player gives its top draft pick to the club that the player is leaving; that club also receives a supplemental pick in the "sandwich" round between the first and second rounds.
  </p>
  <p key="08caa007-510e-47a9-af43-82640d67df75">
   • A Class B free agent is ranked below the top 20 percent but in the top 40 percent of players at his position. A team that loses a Type B player receives a supplemental pick, but the signing team does not lose a pick.
  </p>
  <p key="e5448c0d-0a3b-425c-a9c1-5dd28facc4d1">
   • All other players, who carry no compensation at all. There had previously been a third class of "Type C" players, but that was eliminated in the most recent

   .
  </p>
  <p key="9800772c-6e8d-4f82-8c90-0110c5cc2260">
   To earn a compensatory pick, a free agent must either be signed before the arbitration deadline in early December, or be offered arbitration by their former team but still sign with someone else.
  </p>
  <p key="459d80a7-0431-470a-94b3-ec8dad58ecc9">
   Compensatory picks that one team gives another via this method are the highest available pick that team has, except that a top-15 pick cannot be lost.  If a team owes two other teams draft picks via Type A free agents, the team whose departing player had a higher score gets the higher ranked pick.  A team cannot lose picks it has earned via compensation.  Also, the first 15 picks in the draft cannot be lost via compensation, so a team that is in that rank would give up their second round pick.
  </p>
  <p key="098ceee1-6c17-48b1-8e65-4f56fae71dc8">
   The order of the supplemental round between the first and second rounds is determined by inverse order of the previous year's standings.  All the Type A picks are done first, and then the order resets for all the Type B compensation picks.
  </p>
  <p key="c7479c2d-19d2-404b-80c1-c2ad1594206d">
   Teams can also earn compensation for unsigned picks from the previous year's draft.  If a team doesn't sign a first or second round pick, they will get to pick at the same slot plus one the following year.  For example, if the team with the #5 pick does not sign that player, they would have the #6 pick the following year.  The regular draft order would continue around those picks.  For compensation for not signing a third round pick, teams would get a pick in a supplemental round between the third and fourth rounds.  If a team fails to sign a player with one of these compensated picks, there is no compensation the following year.
