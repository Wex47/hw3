   Known as much for his philanthropic work, Winfield began giving back to the communities in which he played from the beginning of his professional athletic career.  In 1973, his first year with the Padres, he began buying blocks of tickets to Padres games for families who couldn't afford to go to games, in a program known as "pavilions".  Winfield then added health clinics to the equation, by partnering with San Diego's Scripps Clinic who had a mobile clinic which was brought into the stadium parking lot.

   When Winfield played for the Toronto Blue Jays, he learned teammate David Wells was one of the "Winfield kids" in San Diego.

   In his hometown of St. Paul, he began a scholarship program (which continues to this day).  In 1977, he organized his efforts into an official 501(c)(3) charitable organization, known as the David M. Winfield Foundation for Underprivileged Youth, the first

   As his salary increased and he partnered with more corporations, the programs expanded to include holiday dinner giveaways and national scholarships.  In
   1978
   , San Diego hosted the All-Star game, and Winfield bought his usual block of pavilion tickets.  Winfield then went on a local radio station and inadvertently invited "all the kids of San Diego" to attend.  The huge turnout resulted in the first open-practice of the All-Star game, which has been adopted by

   The Foundation also became a bone of contention in Winfield's public feud with

   ; Steinbrenner accused the Foundation of mishandling funds and often held back payments which resulted in long, costly court battles.  Ironically,  Steinbrenner was in fact holding back part of Winfield's salary; he wasn't actually making contributions to the Foundation.  Ultimately, the Foundation was paid and the alleged improprieties proved unfounded.

   This aspect of Winfield's career influenced many of MLB's players as much as his on-field play.
