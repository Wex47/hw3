   's admittance to the
   National League
   . The supposed strike plans never came to fruition, and some baseball historians now question the story's veracity. In an incident three months after the strike controversy, with Robinson playing first base for the
   Dodgers
   , Slaughter hit an infield ground ball and was thrown out by several steps. With Robinson stretched out to make the catch, Slaughter spiked him in the leg. Slaughter denied any malicious intent on the play, and some baseball historians agree that the incident was merely a result of Slaughter's old-school baseball mentality. The incident came on the heels of several high profile brawls between the Cardinals and Dodgers during the pennant races of the 1940s, with Dodger manager and former Cardinal

  <p key="1cef9b6e-c93d-45ef-812e-0fb6cc799a8a">
   Other commentators, however, attached racist motives to Slaughter's actions. After his retirement, sportswriters delayed Slaughter's entrance to the
   Hall of Fame
   over the questionable racial incidents that he was linked to. In later years, Slaughter was asked if he would have an objection to managing black players, and responded that as long as they produced and played hard he would have no problem doing so. Some baseball historians and many contemporaries believe that it was not perceived racism on the part of Slaughter that made him controversial, but rather that it was his relentless give-no-quarter philosophy in the era of coddled free agents that caused the modern baseball establishment to shun him. Aside from the racial accusations swirling around the Robinson incident, Slaughter was known for his generally intense, often violent style of play. The
   Sporting News
   quoted one Dodger contemporary as calling Slaughter "the dirtiest player in the league," a charge Slaughter himself did not refute.
