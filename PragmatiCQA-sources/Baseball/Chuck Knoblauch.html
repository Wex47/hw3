   , the New York Times published a rare look at Chuck Knoblauch's post-baseball life. The article painted Knoblauch's outlook on baseball and The Mitchell Report as being apathetic. As he has been retired for 5 years, he expressed "bewilderment at his inclusion" in the report and stated that "I have nothing to defend and I have nothing to hide at the same time." As of January 2008, Chuck Knoblauch owned a condominium in Houston, and a house in the Houston area, and was not interested in returning to professional baseball in any capacity.
