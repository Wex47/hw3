Ventura's foot was gruesomely twisted and the incident caused his wife, Stephanie, to run onto the field just seconds after.  The initial prognosis was that he would be lost for the season; the news dashed the Sox’ hope of contending. Amazingly, with help from team trainer Herm Schneider, and much pure grit and determination, Ventura returned on

The trade winds almost blew him out of town, too: after speaking out against the pitchers' leaving, he was placed on Reinsdorf's “hit list”.

His homer and RBI totals weren’t far off his career averages, but the Sox attempted repeatedly to trade him and declined to renew his contract, with Reinsdorf claiming that he was “deteriorating”. Despite setting career highs in games played and triples, not to mention leading the league in chances yet again, Ventura finally departed on December 2 when the New York Mets signed him to a four-year deal.

   Ventura's 1997 ankle injury - a compound fracture and dislocation - also affected his leg muscles, which began to atrophy following the accident. For years, Ventura took regular cortisone shots to get through the pain, even taking an average of one per month during his final season. However, full strength in his leg never returned, and the daily pain from his ankle and leg contributed to Ventura's decision to retire from baseball. After retirement, Ventura limped badly and was forced to walk with a cane regularly. On November 18, 2005, Ventura underwent an ankle allograft, a unique procedure that replaced his mangled ankle bone with an exact-sized match from a cadaver. Following the surgery and rehabilitation, Ventura now walks without pain and without a limp. He also sometimes appears on ESPN University as an anchor.
