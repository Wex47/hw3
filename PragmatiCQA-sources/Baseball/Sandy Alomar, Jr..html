   Benito Santiago
   at the major league level.  After two short call-ups with the Padres, he finally got his chance at an everyday job after being traded to Cleveland before the
   1990
   season along with
   Carlos Baerga
   , in exchange for
   Joe Carter
   .  Once in Cleveland, he established himself immediately, becoming the first rookie catcher to start an

   Gold Glove Award
   .  Despite All-Star appearances in each of the next two years, Alomar began to lose more and more time to injuries and failed to realize his potential for several seasons.  He came back strong in the first half of
   1996
   to make his fourth All-Star team, but then faded in the second half.

   In
   1997
   , everything finally came together for Alomar.  He batted .324, was the MVP of the All-Star game, put together a 30-game
   hitting streak
   (one short of
   Nap Lajoie
   's Indians record and four short of his former teammate Benito Santiago's record for catchers), and helped lead Cleveland to their third straight postseason appearance.  In the Division Series against the
