   The third baseman requires good reflexes in reacting to batted balls, as they are often the closest infielder (roughly 90-120 feet) to the batter. They also need a strong arm, since they have the farthest to throw to

   Third base is known as the "Hot Corner", since most
   right-handed
   hitters will tend to hit the ball hard in this direction. In this situation, the third baseman needs fine hand-eye coordination and quick reactions in order to catch hard
