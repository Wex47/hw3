   Cicotte didn't return to the major leagues again until 1908, when he resurfaced with the Red Sox. After he compiled a 41-48 record in a Boston uniform, the Red Sox sold him to the White Sox on July 22, 1912.

   Cicotte celebrated a breakout year in 1913, going 18-12 on the season with an ERA of 1.58. He went on to lead the league in
   winning percentage
   in 1916. But his best year was 1917, when he won 28 games and led the league in wins, ERA (1.53), and
   innings pitched
   . On
   April 13
   he threw a
   no hitter
   against the
   St. Louis Browns
   . That year, the White Sox went to the World Series, defeating the

   Injuries reduced Cicotte to a 12-19 record in 1918, but in 1919, he rebounded to win 29 games and once again lead the league in wins, winning percentage, and innings pitched, as well as in
   complete games
   . His 1919 salary was $6,000, but he had a provision for a $10,000 bonus if he won 30 games. As the season drew to a close, owner
   Charles Comiskey
   ordered manager
   Kid Gleason
   to bench Cicotte, denying him a chance at a 30-win season and the bonus money. Some have speculated this was his motivation for participating in the

   Cicotte was the first of the eight players to come forward, signing a confession and a waiver of immunity.  Cicotte admitted to the grand jury in September, 1920 that he took a $10,000 bribe to "throw" the
   1919 World Series
   . He later recanted this confession and was acquitted of all charges at trial by jury. Despite this, Cicotte and his alleged co-conspirators were subsequently banned for life from baseball by
   Kenesaw Mountain Landis
   , Major League Baseball's new commissioner, recently hired to restore the integrity of the game in the wake of the 1919 scandal.

   .  In that film, the name is incorrectly pronounced as "See-cott" probably stemming from the pronunciation used by Cicotte's (Cy-cottie)'s pitching grand-nephew.  The Society for American Baseball Research has confirmed the "Cy-cottie" pronunciation aliong with all other knowledgeable baseball researchers.  
Cicotte had a grand-nephew who later pitched briefly in the majors (including 1957 with the Yankees), who pronounced his name (See-cott) to distance himself from the Black Sox scandal.
