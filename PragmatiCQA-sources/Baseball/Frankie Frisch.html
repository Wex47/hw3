The Cardinals had won only one pennant before Frisch joined the team; the Giants would win the pennant only once in Frisch's nine seasons as the Cards' regular second baseman. Perhaps his most impressive feat in St. Louis was winning over the fans in the wake of the Hornsby trade; his ability to consistently hit over .300, along with his defense and baserunning - both substantially better than Hornsby's - were significant factors in his favor.

After no players had been selected by the writers in the previous two years (the only elections since Hornsby's selection in 1942), the rules were revised to limit eligibility to those players who had retired after 1921; Frisch was among the first four players to benefit from the more reasonable field of candidates.
