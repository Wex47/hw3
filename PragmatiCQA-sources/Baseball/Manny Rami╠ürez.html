   to bench Ramírez for one game. Despite his strong play in the 2003 post-season, Ramírez's Red Sox lost in heartbreaking fashion to the Yankees in a 7 game showdown in the
   ALCS
   .  The new Red Sox ownership and management, having to deal with the $20 million a year contract, put Ramirez on irrevocable waivers the following offseason, allowing any team to claim him and thus add him to its roster.  However, all 29 other teams passed because of the length and cost of his contract, proving to be a blessing in disguise.

    July 31: Although he is one of the most productive batters in major-league history, Ramírez has been on the trading block every year as the Red Sox have tried to unload the remainder of his $160 million, eight-year contract, often at Ramírez's behest.

   resulted from Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive - and chronic - complaining about the strike zone by Youkilis in the dugout, as well as the first baseman's penchant for throwing equipment after at-bats. Before the fifth inning  - and after the Red Sox-Rays punching session - Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras slapping Youkilis. The pair also exchanged words, and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still barking at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard. According to three sources, Ramirez had told Youkilis to "cut that [expletive] out." That was what provoked Youkilis and started the problem.

   has dubbed this "Manny Being Manny," a term that has entered everyday usage among baseball fans in Boston and across the country, to refer to any baseball mistakes or odd behavior by Ramírez both on and off the field. This phrase was coined when on July 18th, 2005, Manny went into the "Green Monster" in between innings to use the bathroom, and when pitcher
   Wade Miller
   was ready to begin the next inning, Ramirez was nowhere to be found.

At first he thought he hit a home run, and continued to round the bases, until the third base umpire stopped him. The announcers commented on how he was a tremendous young hitter, but seemed to have a short attention span: Manny was then almost immediately picked off at second base by the catcher. Later, after drawing a walk in the 10th inning, he was replaced with a pinch runner.

    - In game five of the ALCS at Jacobs Field, Ramirez hit a fly ball to deep center field that bounced off the top of the outfield wall and back into play. Ramirez, assuming he had hit a home run, casually strolled to first base and was forced to settle for a single instead of an easy double after it was ruled that the ball had never left the field.

    - In the bottom of the 6th inning, in a game against the LA Angels, Manny tried to chase down a fly ball in front of him in left field hit by
    Maicer Izturis
    . He went into a slide to catch the ball, but missed it so it dropped and rolled behind him. He scampered on all fours to get the ball, and ended up rolling on top of the ball when he reached it making centerfielder
    Jacoby Ellsbury
    unable to pick up the ball. Manny had to lift up his rear to get the ball off the ground. When he finally picked up the ball and threw it into the infield with a big smile on his face Izturis was on third base instead of the likely single had Manny just fielded the ball instead of trying to catch it on the fly. Theo Epstein and
    Terry Francona
