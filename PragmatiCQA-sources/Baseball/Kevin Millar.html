   .  From 1997 to 1999, during games encompassing several minor league stints, Millar set the record for most consecutive games reaching base with 71 straight (although this statistic only began to be formally tracked in the minors in 1996). This record was tied in 2003 by future Red Sox teammate

   During the 2003 playoffs, Millar came up with the phrase "Cowboy Up," and in 2004 referred to his team as "idiots" to keep his teammates loose during the stretch run to the World Series Championship. Shortly after coining the phrase "Cowboy Up," Millar trademarked the term late in the 2004 season and earned $0.34 each time the phrase was utilized on television, radio, or print
   . Millar continues to collect royalties stemming from his trademark, totaling upwards of $750,000 through 2007.
