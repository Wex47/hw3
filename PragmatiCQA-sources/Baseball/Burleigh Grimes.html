   His friends and supporters note that he was consistently a kind man when off the diamond. Others claim he showed a greedy attittude to many people that 'got on his bad side.' He would mainly speak to only his best friend Ivy Olsen in the dugout, and would only pitch to a man named Mathias Schroeder before games. Schroeder's identity was not well known among many Dodger players, as many say he was just 'a nice guy from the neighborhood.'
