Traditionally, an umpiring crew rotates such that each umpire in the crew works each position, including plate umpire, an equal number of games.

   For example, on the Major League level, "[t]he Crew Chief shall coordinate and direct his crew's compliance with the Office of the Commissioner's rules and policies. Other Crew Chief responsibilities include: leading periodic discussions and reviews of situations, plays and rules with his crew; generally directing the work of the other umpires on the crew, with particular emphasis on uniformity in dealing with unique situations; assigning responsibilities for maintaining time limits during the game; ensuring the timely filing of all required crew reports for incidents such as ejections, brawls and protested games; and reporting to the Office of Commissioner any irregularity in field conditions at any ballpark."
   [1]
   Thus, on the professional level, some of the duties assigned to the umpire-in-chief (the plate umpire) in the
   Official Baseball Rules
   have been reassigned to the crew chief, regardless of the crew chief's umpiring position.

   , an umpire's judgment call is final, unless the umpire making the call chooses to ask his partner(s) for help and then decides to reverse it after the discussion. For some calls, including balls and strikes, no reversal is possible. If an umpire seems to make an error in rule interpretation, his call, in some leagues, can be officially protested.  If the umpire is persistent in his or her interpretation, the matter will be settled at a later time by a league official.  Such protests are seldom upheld; indeed, in most cases of protest, the umpire's interpretation is found to be correct.

   but the term "amateur" refers to the level of baseball officiated, not the status of the umpire (according to the Little League Baseball/Softball rule book, umpires should be volunteers and not be paid). Umpires are responsible for ensuring that all players, coaches, and fans conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner, and that the game's focus is on playing, rather than on personal matters or "bad blood" between opposing teams. Each umpire has the authority to eject any player, manager, or coach from the premises in order to insure the integrity of the game. In some cases, they have authority over the spectators as well. There are numerous organizations that train/test anyone interested in umpiring for local leagues and can help make connections to the leagues in the area. Little League and Babe Ruth Baseball are two of the most popular organizations when it comes to youth baseball and each have their own application, test, and training process for becoming an umpire.In Canada many municipalities run their own amateur baseball leagues for children and hire umpires. 
The pinnacle of amateur umpiring is the Little League World Series. Amateur umpires from around the world participate in this event on a completely volunteer basis. However, to get to this point umpires must go participate at various levels of All-Star tournaments ranging from district to regional to state tournaments.

   After five weeks of training, each school sends its top students to the Professional Baseball Umpires Corp. (PBUC) evaluation course also held in Florida.  The actual number of students sent on to the evaluation course is determined by PBUC and not the umpire schools.  Generally, the top 10 to 20 percent of each school's graduating class advance.  The evaluation course is conducted by PBUC staff, which differs in personnel from the staff at the respective umpire schools. The evaluation course generally lasts around 10 days.  Depending on the number of available positions in the various minor leagues, some (but not all) of the evaluation course attendees will be assigned to a low level

   Professional umpires begin their careers in a
   Class "A"
   league, which is divided into four levels (rookie, short-season, long-season and advanced "A").  Top umpiring prospects will often begin their careers in a short-season "A" league (for example, the
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="New York-Penn League.html" key="2753b146-0050-4b34-ba65-58981524aae7" title="New York-Penn League">

   ), but most will begin in a rookie league (for example, the

  <p key="81b078e5-626b-4872-9fa5-52f8da87b8f4">
   Throughout the season all minor league umpires in Class A and Class AA are evaluated by members of the PBUC staff.  All umpires receive a detailed written evaluation of their performance after every season.  In addition, all umpires, except those in the rookie or short "A" leagues, receive written mid-season evaluations.
  </p>
  <p key="5e81c79a-33ba-4f8d-a7f8-0e1b73d0d0a9">
   Generally, an umpire is regarded as making adequate progress "up the ranks" if he advances up one level of Class "A" ball each year (thus earning promotion to Class AA after three to four years) and promotion to Class AAA after two to three years on the Class AA level.  However, this is a very rough estimate and other factors not discussed (such as a lack of or overwhelming number of retirements at higher levels) may dramatically affect these estimates.  For example, many umpires saw rapid advancement in 1999 due to the mass resignation of many Major League umpires as a collective bargaining ploy.

   In addition, top AAA prospects may also be rewarded with umpiring only Major League pre-season games during spring training (in lieu of Class AAA games).  Finally, the very top prospects may umpire Major League regular season games on a limited basis as "fill-in" umpires (where the Class AAA umpire replaces a sick, injured or vacationing Major League umpire).
  </p>
  <p key="2c13dd03-39a0-4d2a-ab28-ba8631854b0f">
   Finally, upon the retirement (or firing) of a Major League umpire, a top Class AAA umpire will be promoted to Major League Baseball's permanent umpire staff. During this entire process, if an umpire is evaluated as no longer being a major-league prospect, he (or she) will be released, ending their professional career.
