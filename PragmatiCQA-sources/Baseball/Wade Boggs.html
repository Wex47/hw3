   A left-handed hitter, Boggs won five batting titles starting in
   1983
   . He also batted .349 in his rookie year which would have won the batting title, but was 121 plate appearances short of the required minimum of 502. From
   1982

   , Boggs hit below .349 only once, hitting .325 in

   Bill Madlock

   The historic ball was caught in the right field stands of Tropicana Field by Mike Hogan, a sports information director at the University of South Florida, who gave it back to Boggs at the conclusion of the game. Hogan had moved to Tampa just 10 days prior to the event. Boggs retired in

Before Boggs joined the Yankees, they were 14th in pitches per plate appearance, and 4th and then 1st after he joined. In addition, the Yankees were 12th and 8th in

   Before his retirement, Boggs was plagued by newspaper reports that the expansion Devil Rays gave him financial compensation in return for selecting a Devil Rays cap for his plaque at the

   , though he has denied that any such condition was part of his contract.
   In light of those reports (and other rumors that teams were offering number retirement, money or organizational jobs in exchange for the cap designation) the Hall decided in 2001 to change its practice of deferring to players wishes regarding cap logo selection, and reinforced the Hall's authority to determine with which cap the player would be depicted. Wade Boggs was elected to the

The Hall decided that Boggs would eventually be depicted wearing a Boston cap for his 2005 induction, despite his acrimonious relationship with Red Sox management. During the Hall of Fame player introductions of the 2008 All-Star Game at Yankee Stadium, he decided to wear the Yankees cap instead.
