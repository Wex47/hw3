   and is considered to be one of the top pitchers in the history of baseball. In April 2006, Martínez gained his 200th career win (against 84 losses, the highest winning percentage for any 200-game winner).
  </p>
  <p key="c4014d8a-1fc2-4bad-b5cf-ea6ede355145">
   Martínez is unusual for a power pitcher as he is listed as 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) and 170 pounds (77 kg), small by modern-day standards.
  </p>
  <p key="2ecbbb94-d1a6-419e-9f5e-91d28cc58ed3">
   Martinez is also atypical in that he has many "out" pitches upon which he can rely. His
   fastball
   , breaking
   curveball
   and
   circle changeup
   are all well above average; combined with his historically excellent control, they proved to be an overpowering package. Martínez throws from a low three-quarter position that hides the ball very well from batters, who have remarked on the difficulty of picking up Martínez's delivery. Throughout his career, his arm angle has dropped increasingly lower; he presently throws from the "low 3/4" slot.
  </p>
  <p key="534d8cbe-2ff4-4a3f-b428-4ea48b5eb668">
   Earlier in his career, his fastball was consistently clocked in the 95 mph (153 km/h) range; used in combination with his devastating changeup and occasionally mixing in his excellent curveball, he was as dominant a pitcher as the game has ever seen. In recent years, as injuries have taken their toll, Martinez has made the adjustment to rely more on guile than power. His fastball now is usually in the 88-89 mph (142-144 km/h) range, although he is still able to throw a mid-90s fastball when the need arises. He now uses his curveball, circle-changeup, and an occasional slider, along with his fastball.  With his command of the strike zone, he continues to be a top strikeout pitcher even though he does not throw as hard as he once did. Baseball historian
   Bill James
   describes Martinez as being exponentially more effective than his pitching peers due to his variety of pitches, arm angles, pitch speeds, pinpoint control, and numerous modes of deception.

At the end of May, he was 5-1 with a 2.50 ERA, with 88 strikeouts and 17 walks and 44 hits allowed in 76 innings; Martinez's record was worse than it could have been, with the bullpen blowing leads for him, and with one of the games being a 0-0 matchup with Arizona's

Beginning on June 6, Martinez went 4-7 with a 7.10 ERA in a series of spotty starts interrupted twice by stays on the disabled list.

   . "To go back, I have to recover, I have to be healthy. But if God doesn't want that, then I would have to think about giving it all up."  Martinez added, "It's going to be a bitter winter because I am going to have to do a lot of work. The pain I feel was one of the worst I have felt with any injury in my career."  Martinez's injuries have jeopardized his chances of reaching certain milestones; currently, he has 2,998 strikeouts.

   By December 30, 2006, Martinez was more optimistic: "The progress has been excellent. I don't have problems anymore with my reach or flexibility, and so far everything is going very well. The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. You have to let it run its course. So we're aiming for July or August as the return date." Martinez also reports bulking up as part of his recuperative regimen: "I've put on about 10 pounds of muscle, because that's one of our strategies."
   Both Martinez and the Mets remain hopeful that he will return to major league action during the second half of the 2007 season.

   Martinez was able to return to the mound for the Mets in September 2007, starting five games and finishing 3-1 with a 2.57 ERA.  He collected his 3000th career strikeout during his first start back.  His return was not enough to stop the Mets' slide out of the playoffs.
