   curveball
   . Selig received a bachelor's degree in American History and Political Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in
   1956
   . While at the University of Wisconsin, he became a member of Pi Lambda Phi Fraternity. After serving two years in the armed forces, Selig returned to Milwaukee and began working in the automobile business with his father.

   1953
   . Selig became the team's largest public stockholder. Selig was heartbroken and devastated when he learned that the Braves were going to leave Milwaukee in favor of Atlanta. In

   World Series
   (the first time it had not been staged since

Notably, the National Basketball Association (NBA), National Hockey League (NHL), and National Football League (NFL) commissioners have always been considered primarily as advocates for the league owners who elect them and who they are answerable to. Some have argued that Selig's role as the first clearly pro-owner commissioner has led directly to MLB's ability to institute changes and bargain strongly with the

If found guilty the league could have been liable for $300 million in punitive damages. Selig was eager to settle the case because the judge had previously ruled that the Expos could not be moved or contracted until the case was over. The case eventually went to arbitration and was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.

   in Selig's hometown of
   Milwaukee
   . The game was tied 7-7 in the bottom of the 11th inning. Unfortunately, the recent custom of allowing each player appearance time meant that the managers had used their entire rosters. To avoid risking the arms of the pitchers who were currently on the mound, Selig declared the game a tie, to the dissatisfaction of the Milwaukee fans. Since then, Selig has tried to reinvigorate the All-Star Game, most notably by awarding the winning league home-field advantage in the World Series. The 2003 All-Star Game had the same U.S. viewership as 2002 (9.5 rating; 17 share) and the ratings declined in 2004 (8.8 rating; 15 share) and 2005 (8.1 rating; 14 share)

   In
   2005
   , he faced U.S. Congress on the issue of Anabolic steroids. Since the Congressional hearings in early 2005, Selig has put forth a much more strict proposal for steroid testing to replace the current system. This proposal also makes Selig the first major sports commissioner to propose the banning of amphetamines, which, some say, are more of a problem in baseball than steroids themselves.
