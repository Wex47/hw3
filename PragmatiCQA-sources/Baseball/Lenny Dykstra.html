   with 105, which was a league record for 17 years. That season, he batted .358 with 8 HR, 81 RBI, and 105 stolen bases while recording 107 walks against just 35 strikeouts.  He was consequently named the Carolina League's MVP.   Dykstra soon emerged as one of the Mets prized prospects, and while playing in AA in 1984, he befriended fellow outfielder and teammate
   Billy Beane
   .  Beane would later say that Dykstra was "perfectly designed, emotionally" to play baseball and that he had "no concept of failure."

The following season, Dykstra was slated to serve as part of a center field platoon with Wilson, but when Wilson suffered a bad eye injury during spring training, Dykstra began the season as the outright starter and leadoff hitter.  Later that season, the Mets would release

   National League East
