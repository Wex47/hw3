    or not, he accepted money from gamblers to do so.  For this reason, he has never been elected to the Hall of Fame.  If he's not eligible for induction, the reasoning goes, Rose shouldn't be, either.  In addition, because of the
    Black Sox Scandal
    , the rules against betting on baseball and consorting with gamblers are posted in every professional baseball clubhouse, where it is seen (if not read) every day by every person who comes in.  The rule was clear, Rose knew it as well as anyone else, and broke it anyway.  And, as a baseball historian, particularly aware of Ty Cobb and his contemporaries (and Cobb was a friend and admirer of Jackson), Rose knew full well the consequences of Jackson's actions.  He bet on baseball anyway.** While ESPN also did a "You Can't Blame" trying to let Jackson and the other "Black Sox" off the hook for throwing the Series, they did not take a stand on whether Jackson, more than half a century after his death, had suffered enough and should be in the Hall.

    4. The Hall of Fame.  It decides who shall be permitted in and not.  The Hall's Board of Directors chose to make ineligible for induction any person on MLB's "permanently ineligible" list.  If the Hall changed its mind and said that Rose, Shoeless Joe or anyone else on the list was now eligible for induction, there's nothing MLB or its Commissioner could do about it, short of lobbying the voters to vote against Rose and/or Jackson.  It's out of MLB's hands.

    1. Rose lied about his actions for 15 years.  Had he, from the beginning, admitted what he'd done, apologized, and asked MLB and baseball fans for forgiveness, it's likely he would have been given a lesser penalty, or perhaps reinstated after a few years.  It has been said that America is a forgiving nation, but the forgiveness must be preceded by confession and repentance, and while Rose has now confessed, he gives the impression that he is sorry only that he was caught and punished, not for what he did to get there. As a result, several of the Hall-of-Famers themselves,
