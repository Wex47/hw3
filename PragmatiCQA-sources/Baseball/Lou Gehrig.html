The Yankees became the first team to put numbers on their jerseys when the coach went down the lineup and gave each player a number based on their spot in the batting order. Ruth was assigned 3, and Gehrig was assigned 4, numbers that would not change, even as the order was rearranged down the line.  Lou Gehrig is tied with Joe DiMaggio for the record of most career games with 4 long hits in one game, with 5 such games.  Gehrig set records for most consecutive years (13) with 100 runs scored, 100 runs batted in, and 300 total bases (1926-1938).  Prior to 2008, each feat was tied once (by 3 different players).  Hank Aaron had 100 runs scored for 13 consecutive years (1955-1967), Jimmy Foxx had 13 consecutive years of 100 batted in (1929-1941), and Willie Mays had 300 total bases for 13 consecutive years (1954-1966).  In 2008, Alex Rodriguez became the 2nd player with 13 consecutive years of 100 runs scored (1996-2008).  Rodriguez' streak was stopped in his injury-plagued 2009 season when he scored only 78 runs.
