   The White Sox were a frequent contender during the early 20th century, winning 5 of the first 19 league pennants; but the team's fortunes dropped precipitously in the aftermath of the
   1919 "Black Sox" scandal

   2005
   when it won its first World Series Championship since
   1917

   It is interesting to note that since 1920, although the White Sox have won fewer pennants than the Cubs or Red Sox - whose fans can be considered among the most angst-riddled fans in all of sports - as well as being responsible for perhaps the biggest scandal in baseball history, the White Sox' fan base has largely shrugged off their relative lack of success over the years, blaming it more on inferior teams, poor management and bad luck rather than some other-worldly "curse". Even the players who conspired to fix the 1919 World Series seem not to have been reviled or held responsible for the White Sox' lack of success as much as certain Cubs and Red Sox icons have been. Rightly or wrongly, those Sox players have often been seen as victims, and Comiskey himself has often been seen as bearing a large part of the blame for what happened due to his extremely frugal management style.

   Although the White Sox had winning records every season from 1951 through 1967, the Yankees dynasty of the era often left the Sox frustrated in second place; they were league runner-up 5 times between 1957 and 1965. Health problems forced Veeck to sell the team to brothers Arthur and John Allyn in 1961, and while the team continued to play well, many of the ballpark thrills seemed to be missing.

   ), but frantic lobbying of the part of the Illinois governor and state legislature resulted in approval (by one vote) of public funding for a new stadium. Although designed primarily as a baseball stadium (as opposed to a "multipurpose" stadium) New Comiskey Park (redubbed

   in 2003) was built in a 1960s style similar to

   . It opened in 1991 to positive reviews; many praised its wide open concourses, excellent sight lines, and natural grass (unlike other stadiums of the era such as
   Skydome
   in Toronto.) However, it was quickly overshadowed in the public imagination by the wave of "nostalgia" or "retro" ballparks, beginning with

   Despite a number of innovations in its original construction - including a lower deck concourse that circumscribes the entire stadium, allowing a view of the game from any location - the park was often criticized for its sterile appearance and steep upper deck. The playing field's distance from the stands has also been criticized by Chicago fans accustomed to more intimate ballparks.

Notable renovations of early phases included: re-orientation of the bullpens parallel to the field of play (thus decreasing slightly the formerly symmetrical dimensions of the outfield); filling seats in up to and shortening the outfield wall; ballooning foul-line seat sections out toward the field of play; creating a new multi-tiered

   More recently, the top third of the upper deck was removed in 2004 and a black wrought metal roof was placed over it, covering all but the first 8 rows of seats. This decreased seating capacity from 47,000 to 40,615. 2005 also saw the introduction of the Scout Seats, redesignating (and re-upholstering) 200 lower deck seats behind home plate as an exclusive area, with seat-side waitstaff and a complete restaurant located underneath the concourse. The most significant structural addition besides the new roof was 2005's FUNdamentals Deck, a multi-tiered structure on the left field concourse containing batting cages, a small

   1920
   , when they finished second in the league thanks to the late-season "Black Sox" suspensions. The combination of the league's best record with the American League victory in the All-Star Game gave the White Sox the home field advantage throughout the 2005 post-season (perhaps unnecessary as the White Sox won every post-season road game they played in 2005).

   Among the other changes that occurred in 2005 (and still seen in 2006) was the creation of a new marketing campaign, referring to the team's new style of play. 2005 saw a much-reduced reliance on power hitting (even though the team still hit over 200 home runs on the season), and a move toward speed, and defense. This culminated in what locally became known as "Ozzieball" or "Grinderball". As part of the marketing campaign, the White Sox began inventing "The Grinder Rules", a list of fictitious "rules" created as a part of an advertising campaign, and a way of reminding fans about the changes to the team, and the success it was bringing. The first Grinder Rule became the team's motto for the 2005 season: "Win, or die trying!"

   The rules themselves are an "incomplete" list, as the numbers are somewhat random. They are collected from print, billboard, television, and radio advertisements, as well as advertising at
   U.S. Cellular Field

   The ALDS also set the tone for what would be an unusually suspenseful post-season; while their first game was considered a blow-out, the remaining games saw the White Sox making the most of rare opportunities and hanging on to narrow leads. In Game 2, the White Sox were actually down 4-2 when Red Sox second baseman Tony Graffanino, formerly playing for the White Sox, let Juan Uribe's potential inning-ending, double-play grounder go through his legs; one out later, Tadahito Iguchi hit a three-run homer to left that clinched the game for the White Sox. In Game 3, Orlando Hernandez entered the game with the bases loaded and nobody out with the White Sox ahead by only one run in the bottom of the sixth inning. Based on their regular season performance, it was later calculated that the Red Sox's probability of winning at that point was .662, even though they were trailing by one run. Instead, the first two batters, Jason Varitek and Tony Graffanino, both popped out, and Johnny Damon struck out swinging on a breaking ball. Hernandez went on to retire six of the next seven batters, and the White Sox's rookie reliever Bobby Jenks closed out the game.

   The White Sox championship run can be considered one for the ages. Apart from a brief shaky stretch in early September, White Sox team displayed sheer dominance as evident by the wire-to-wire first place in American League. Only the 1927 Yankees were able to achieve such a feat. Their 11-1 postseason record was tied with 1999 Yankees as the best single post season mark. (Only Cincinnati Reds in 1976 had a better winning percentage by going 7-0). The White Sox also became the only team to win all three post-season victories on the road. Amazingly, despite their 105 year history, this was only the franchise's third World Series championship, (following victories in 1917 and 1906). It also marked their first pennant since the advent of divisional play in 1969 (the White Sox won the inaugural American League pennant in 1901, but this was 2 years prior to the first modern World Series).

    History of White Sox uniforms
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="f4bd19ff-0c57-464f-b123-62698c62d062">
   Over the years the White Sox have become noted for many of their uniform innovations and changes. In 1960, the White Sox became the first team in the major sports to put players' last names on jerseys.
  </p>
  <p key="fad7603b-394b-4a52-8699-7162bf7fdf62">
   Although the uniforms in the very early days of the franchise featured a block "C" in red, the uniforms' primary color switched to a navy or midnight blue (on white) after a couple of years. Again, a block "C" was often the only adornment.
  </p>
  <p key="2e44bdd3-5432-4442-b57f-28e0b1d2d200">
   In 1912, however, the White Sox debuted one of the most enduring and famous logos in baseball—a large "S" in a Roman-style font, with a small "O" inside the top loop of the "S" and a small "X" inside the bottom loop. This is the logo associated with the 1917 World Series championship team and the 1919 Black Sox. With a couple of brief interruptions, the dark blue logo with the large "S" lasted through 1938 (but continued in a modified block style into the '40s). Through the 1940s, the White Sox team colors were primarily navy blue trimmed with red.
  </p>
  <p key="2b409f5f-6dbf-4499-847f-0927040f08ba">
   The White Sox logo in the '50s and '60s (actually beginning in the 1949 season) was the word "SOX" in an Old English font, diagonally arranged, with the "S" larger than the other two letters. From 1949 through 1963, the primary color was black (trimmed with red after 1951). The Old English "SOX" in black lettering is the logo associated with the Go-Go Sox era.
  </p>
  <p key="417fe200-37ce-4996-9cde-e20ee2c36b95">
   In 1964, the primary color went back to navy blue, and the road uniforms changed from gray to pale blue. In 1971, the team's primary color changed from royal blue to red, with the color of their pinstripes and caps changing to red. Curiously, the 1971-1975 uniform included red socks.

   In 1976 the team's uniforms changed again. The team's primary color changed back from red to navy. The team based their uniforms on a style worn in the early days of the franchise, with white jerseys worn at home, blue on the road. The team also had the option to wear blue or white pants with either jersey. Additionally the teams "SOX" logo was changed to a modern-looking "SOX" in a bold font, with 'CHICAGO' written across the jersey. Finally, the team's logo featured a silhouette of a batter over the words "SOX".

   The new uniforms also featured collars and were designed to be worn untucked - both unprecedented wrinkles. Yet by far the most unusual wrinkle was the option to wear shorts, which the White Sox did for one game against the

   had tried the same concept at one time, and it was also poorly received. Apart from aesthetic issues, as a practical matter shorts are not conducive to sliding, due to the likelihood of significant abrasions.

   announced a contest where fans were invited to create new uniforms for the White Sox. The winning entry was submitted by a fan where the word "SOX" was written across the front of the jersey, in the same font as a cap, inside of a large blue stripe trimmed with red. The red and blue stripes were also on the sleeves, and the road jerseys were gray to the home whites. It was in those jerseys that the White Sox won 99 games and the AL West championship in 1983, the best record in the majors.
  </p>
  <p key="88ed3824-4867-42f5-945b-695c0d8fb94c">
   After five years those uniforms were retired and replaced with a more basic uniform which had "White Sox" written across the front in script, with "Chicago" on the front of the road jersey. The cap logo was also changed to a cursive "C", although the batter logo was retained for several years.
  </p>
  <p key="86f2848c-2752-4b89-84d6-3b64de51545c">
   For a mid-season 1990 game at Comiskey Park the White Sox appeared one time in a uniform based on that of the 1917 White Sox.
  </p>
  <p key="7d5862a8-b154-4e92-b4e6-91d8e2643999">
   The White Sox then switched their regular uniform style one more time. In September, for the final series at Old Comiskey Park, the old English "SOX" logo (a slightly simplified version of the 1949 logo) was restored, and the new uniform also had the black pinstripes restored. The team's primary color changed back to black—this time with silver trim. With minor modifications (i.e., occasionally wearing vests, black game jerseys) the White Sox have used this style ever since.

   of the White Sox, a rivalry that some made fun of prior to the Sox's 2005 title due to the fact that both of them had extremely long championship droughts. The nature of the rivalry is unique; with the exception of the
   1906 World Series
   , in which the White Sox upset the favored Cubs, the teams never met in an official game until
   1997
   , when interleague play was introduced. In the intervening time, the two teams sometimes met for exhibition games. An example of this volatile rivalry is the game played between the
   White Sox
   and the
   Cubs
   at
   U.S. Cellular Field
   on May 20, 2006. White Sox catcher
   A.J. Pierzynski
   was running home on a sacrifice fly by centerfielder

   U.S. Cellular Field

   . While there are other major league cities and metropolitan areas in which two teams co-exist, all of the others feature at least one team which began playing there in
   1961
   or later, whereas the Sox and Cubs have been competing for their city's fans since
   1901
   . Only in New York, where the Yankees and Mets compete is there a comparable intra-city rivalry.

   Many fans of one Chicago baseball team dislike the other team. Loyalties are often determined by longstanding family allegiance to one team or the other, or, almost as frequently, whether they live on the South Side or the North Side. In this, Chicago retains a local rivalry like those once experienced in other cities. Like Chicago and New York, Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis once had crosstown rivalries, but have since been lost as teams moved in the 1950s to other cities (even the 1962 expansion New York Mets are a stand-in for the old Giants-Dodgers-Yankee rivalry), Chicago's rivalry is ongoing, dating from the old "baseball wars" of 1901, and no doubt now intensified by the recent White Sox triumph.

   The teams have competed fairly equally for local fans for much of their co-existence. Through 2005, the Cubs have drawn greater attendance 60 times, and the White Sox 45 times, but the difference is primarily a recent effect, as the White Sox have only outdrawn the Cubs twice since 1984 (1991–92, the first two years after the current ballpark opened). The Cubs' attendance advantage in the last two decades can partly be attributed to the fact that their games began being broadcast nationally on WGN-TV] in 1978, creating a national following for the team and establishing

   , parent company of WGN, purchased the Cubs in 1981. Additionally, far fewer Sox games were shown on WGN after their return to the station.) As Chicago's South Side and suburbs are roughly equal in population to those on the North Side, the local fan bases of the two teams may be similar in size.

However, with the White Sox first world championship in 88 years occurring in 2005, their competitiveness in 2006, and the changing demographics in the Bridgeport neighborhood, the White Sox appear to be creeping up in popularity with the Cubs. They surpassed the Cubs in TV and radio ratings, and a recent poll revealed the White Sox to be Chicago's favorite team, topping the Bears and the Cubs.
