   Sabermetricians call into question traditional measures of baseball skill.  For instance,
   batting average
   is considered to be a statistic of limited usefulness because it turns out to be a poor predictor of a team's ability to score runs.  Typical sabermetric reasoning would say that runs win ballgames, and so a good measure of a player's worth is his ability to help his team score more runs than the opposing team.

   Sabermetrics is concerned both with determining the value of a player in a season gone by, and with trying to predict the value of a player in the future based on his past performances.  These are not the same thing.  For example, a player with a high batting average one year may have been very valuable to his team, but batting average is known to be a volatile stat and relying on it to remain high in future years is often not a good principle.  A sabermetrician might argue that a high
   walk
   rate is a better indication that a player will retain his value in the future.

   While this area of study is still in development, it has yielded many interesting insights into the game of baseball, and in the area of performance measurement generally.

  <p key="fde65eba-9a43-4abd-961b-4522fe8b26c4">
   Some sabermetric measurements have entered mainstream baseball usage, especially
   OPS
   (on-base plus slugging) and, to a lesser extent,
   WHIP
   (walks plus hits per inning pitched).

   .  Although not a public proponent of sabermetrics, it has been widely noted that Beane has steered the team during his tenure according to sabermetric principles:  Batters should try to get walks, traditional defensive statistics (such as errors and fielding percentage) are less important than people think, pitchers should be able to strike out batters, spending amateur draft picks on high school pitchers is a bad use of resources, etc. Since the Athletics have lower revenues and are considered a small market team, Beane's use of sabermetrics to capitalize on what are perceived to be undervalued talents (walks, defensive range, etc.) is considered crucial to competing with larger market teams like the
   Yankees
   and
   Red Sox
