   Eventually Ford went from the No. 4 pitcher on a great staff to the universally acclaimed No. 1 pitcher of the Yankees, becoming known as the "Chairman of the Board" (nickname assigned by catcher Elston Howard) for his ability to remain calm and in command during high-pressure situations. He was also known as "Slick" for his craftiness on the mound, necessary because he did not have an overwhelming fastball, but being able to throw several other pitches very well gave him pinpoint control.

   . His won-loss percentage of .690 is not just due to being on a fine team. The Yankees were 1,486-1,027 during his 16 years. Without his 236-106, they had 1,250 wins and 921 losses, for a won-loss of .576. Ford was thus .114 higher than his team's record net of his record. On top of that, Casey Stengel, Yankees manager for all of Ford's career through 1960, often "saved" his ace left-hander for more formidable opponents such as the Tigers, Indians and White Sox. When he became manager in 1961, Ralph Houk promised Ford he would pitch every fourth day, regardless of opponent. A career-best 25-4 record ensued, but Ford's season was overshadowed by the scintillating home-run battle between Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle.

Ford would sometimes use the diamond in his wedding ring to gouge the ball, but he was eventually caught by an umpire and warned to stop. Howard then sharpened a buckle on his shinguard and used it to scuff the ball.
