Giambi got off to a horrible start in 2008, hitting below .200 for more than a month.  However as of June he has turned his season around and became one of the team's most productive players, hitting 32 homeruns with an on-base percentage of 0.373.  On November 5, 2008, the Yankees declined the option on Giambi's contract for the 2009 season making Giambi a free agent.
