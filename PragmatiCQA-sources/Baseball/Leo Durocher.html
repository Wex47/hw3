A controversial and outspoken character, Durocher's career was dogged by clashes with authority, umpires (his 95 career ejections as a manager trailed only McGraw when he retired, and still rank fourth on the all-time list), and the press.

   And in his first season as a manager,
   1939
   , Durocher epitomized the position for which most would remember him. As a manager, his temperament came into its own, and the most enduring images of Durocher are of him standing toe-to-toe with an umpire, vehemently arguing his case until his inevitable ejection from the game. In assembling his teams, he valued the same characteristics in his players, his philosophy best expressed in the widely quoted – but misunderstood – phrase for which he now best remembered: "Nice guys finish last."
  </p>
  <p key="2ebd375a-e126-48e3-8853-709c7b3d8697">
   In a
   July 6
   ,
   1946
   interview with
   Red Barber
   , Durocher had been commenting on the common belief at the time that if a team's players got along well, they would naturally play better than teams with difficult or irascible players; noting some of the players on the Giants who had reputations as personable individuals, notably
   Mel Ott
   , he observed that they were all "nice guys", but would nonetheless finish last (while his Dodgers were in first place), summing up his argument with, "Nice guys; finish last." Durocher later noted that the remark was quoted accurately in the published interview, but came to take on a different meaning when some incorrectly thought he meant that such a team would finish last
   <i key="b20121a5-7416-4a1a-b622-c289d23040c3">
    because

   it included "nice guys", when in fact he had meant that there was no correlation (and in fact, saw it more as an
   <i key="5ebddc99-13f3-47e9-a184-f43bff54c2f6">
    ironic
   </i>
   situation) between the personalities on a team and their level of play. (See 1966 Chicago Cubs, below.) Thus the quote "Nice guys finish last" has long been attributed to Durocher, including an entry in
   <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvQmFydGxldHQlMjdzX0ZhbWlsaWFyX1F1b3RhdGlvbnM/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x" key="536a024f-315a-4ada-a912-cc8370bfb544" title="Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (page does not exist)">
    Bartlett's Familiar Quotations
   </span>
   . Many historians assert, however, that the famous four words never were actually uttered by Durocher; the quotation as it is remembered actually came from headline writers distilling Durocher's quote that "The nice guys are all over there, in seventh place, not in this dugout" into a pithy soundbite.
  </p>
  <p key="85e84a92-1223-4592-879b-fad65020df27">
   The Dodgers were coming off six straight losing seasons, but Durocher made a quick turnaround; apart from the war year of 1944, he would not have a losing campaign with the team. In
   1941
   , just his third season of managing, he led the Dodgers to the National League pennant (their first in 21 years) with a 100-54 record. They lost the
   1941 World Series
   to the Yankees in five games and just missed the
   1942
   NL pennant despite winning 104 games.
  </p>
  <p key="58a9ba6e-ea34-4450-b59d-b2a7ac2836fa">
   Yet despite all the success between 1939-42, Durocher and GM MacPhail had a tempestous relationship. MacPhail was a notorious drinker and as hot-tempered as his manager, and often he would fire Durocher in the midst of a night of drinking. In the morning, however, MacPhail would always hire Durocher back. Finally, with
