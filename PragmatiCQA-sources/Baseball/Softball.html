   the ball and may throw the ball freely between players, so one player can field the ball while another moves to a position to put out the runner. The defense can
   <i key="ac70e27b-2594-4a5d-b04f-767db7d4ca08">
    tag
   </i>
   the runner, by touching the runner with the ball while the runner is not on a base. The defense can also touch first base while in possession of the ball; in this case it is sufficient to beat the batter to first base and an actual tag of the batter is unnecessary.  A runner is said to be
   <i key="f5329323-b768-45fa-bc37-376f8a55ab98">
    thrown out
   </i>
   when the play involves 2 or more defensive players. Runners generally cannot be put out when touching a base, but only 1 runner may occupy a base at any time and runners may not pass each other. When a ball is batted into play, runners generally must attempt to advance if there are no open bases behind them; for example, a runner on first base must run to second base if the batter puts the ball in play. In such a situation, the defense can throw to the base that the lead runner is attempting to take (a
   <i key="10e5d2e3-b20d-4ef0-806d-faf9b832427d">
    force out

   ), and the defense can then also throw to the previous base. This can result in a multiple-out play: a
   <i key="bc8b624a-0d37-4fc0-8756-8f01ff4a4cca">
    double play
   </i>
   is 2 outs, while a
   <i key="a28ffb69-9251-481e-a879-2d38d73e52e7">
    triple play
   </i>
   is 3 outs. Runners with an open base behind them are not forced to advance but may do so at their own risk; the defense must tag such runners directly to put them out rather than tagging the base.

  <p key="69d1c11c-c3e7-4195-891e-c53d914c60e1">
   A ball which is hit in the air and caught before hitting the ground is an immediate out, regardless of whether the ball would have landed fair or foul. A

   <i key="266beb1b-810c-4dfd-800e-8580795a66fc">
    line drive
   </i>
   is a ball hit close to the horizontal. In any such situation, runners must remain on their bases until the ball is caught or hits the ground. If a runner leaves the base before the catch, the defense can throw the ball to that base, and if the base is tagged before the runner returns, the runner is out as well, resulting in a double play. If the runner remains on the base until the ball is caught, or returns to the base after the catch but before the defense can put him out, he is said to

   and may attempt to advance to the next base at his own risk.
  </p>
  <p key="da8d5317-55d1-4cd0-a769-4b4f9250dd42">
   Offensive strategy is fairly straightforward, revolving around hitting the ball to enable the batter to reach base safely and to advance the base runners towards home plate. Defensive strategy can be more complex, with particular situations calling for different positioning and tactical decision making. For both sides, there can be a trade-off between outs and runs: the offense can

    sacrifice
   </i>
   a batter to advance runners, while the defense may allow a runner to score if the remaining runners can be put out in a double play.

   at each corner. The bases other than home plate are 15 in (38 cm) square, of canvas or a similar material, and not more than 5 in (13 cm) thick. The bases are usually securely fastened to the ground. The bases are numbered counter clockwise as first base, second base, and third base. Often, but not always, outside first base (that is, in foul territory) and adjacent and connected to it there is a contrast-colored "double base" or "safety base". It is intended to prevent collisions between the first baseman and the runner. The runner runs for the foul portion of the double base after hitting the ball while the fielding team tries to throw the ball to the regular first base before the runner reaches the safety base. However, not all softball diamonds have these safety bases and they are much more common in women's softball than in men's. The double base is required in ISF championships.

   The infield consists of the diamond and the adjacent space in which the infielders (see below) normally play. The outfield is the remaining space between the baselines and between the outfield fence and the infield. The infield is usually "skinned" (dirt), while the outfield has grass in regulation competitions.

In 2002, high-visibility yellow "optic" covering, long-used for restricted flight balls in co-ed recreational leagues, became standard for competitive play.

   All defensive players wear fielding gloves, made of leather or similar material. Gloves have webbing between the thumb and forefinger, known as the "pocket". The first baseman and the catcher may wear mitts; mitts are distinguished from gloves in that they have extra padding, and no fingers. In 2007, ASA and other organizations revised their rules regarding gloves and mitts, allowing any player to use a glove or mitt. Except for the pitcher, whose glove cannot be white or gray (this confuses the batter), gloves and mitts can be any color. Gloves used in softball are generally larger than the ones used in baseball.

   Including for softball players, most players use "sliding shorts" otherwise known as compression short for other sports like soccer, football etc. These shorts help to protect the upper thigh when sliding into a base. Another additional sliding equipment used are "sliders". These are somewhat padded shinguards that extend usually from the ankle to the knee of the wearer and wrap all the way around the leg(s). They protect the shin, calf, etc. from getting bruised or damaged while sliding into homeplate and make it easier to slide into the plate.

This is to prevent damage to the face.

   . They make the decisions like a referee in football. The number of umpires on a given game can range from a minimum of one to a maximum of seven. There is never more than one "plate umpire"; there can be up to three "base umpires", and up to a further three umpires positioned in the outfield.  Most fast pitch games use a crew of two umpires (one plate umpire, one base umpire).
  </p>
  <p key="913fc2d4-13f1-4a55-8f24-216fdf041df8">
   Official umpires are often nicknamed "blue", because of their uniforms – in many jurisdictions, most significantly ISF, NCAA and ASA games, umpires wear navy blue slacks, a light powder blue shirt, and a navy baseball cap. Some umpires wear a variant of the uniform: some umpires in ASA wear heather gray slacks and may also wear a navy blue shirt; umpires from the USSSA wear red shirts with black shorts; NSA umpires generally wear either a cream- or black-colored shirt. Canadian umpires can wear either a light blue or red shirt. Regardless of what uniform is worn, all umpires in the same game are required to have matching clothing.
Decisions are usually indicated by both the use of hand signals, and by vocalizing the call. Safe calls are made by signaling with flat hands facing down moving away from each other, and a verbal call of "safe". Out calls are made by raising the right hand in a clenched fist, with a verbal call of "out". Strikes are called by the plate umpire, who uses the same motion as the out call with a verbal call of "strike". Balls are only called verbally, with no hand gesture. The umpire also has the option of not saying anything on a ball. It is understood that when he stands up, the pitch was not a strike. Foul balls are called by extending both arms up in the air with a verbal call of "foul ball", while fair balls are indicated only by pointing towards fair territory with no verbal call.
All decisions made by the umpire(s) are considered to be final. Only decisions where a rule might have been misinterpreted are considered to be protestable. At some tournaments there might be a rules interpreter or Tournament Chief Umpire (TCU) (also known as the Umpire In Chief, or UIC) available to pass judgment on such protests, but it is usually up to the league or association involved to decide if the protest would be upheld. Protests are never allowed on what are considered "judgment calls" – balls, strikes, safes, fair/foul and outs.

  </h3>
  <p key="65be2ad4-903a-4eef-9cd3-12971284a7a0">
   The Play begins with the umpire saying "Play Ball". After the batter is ready and all fielders (except the catcher) are in fair territory, the pitcher stands at the pitching plate and attempts to throw the ball past the batter to the catcher behind home plate. The throw, or pitch, must be made with an underarm often called "windmill" motion: the ball must be released below the hip when the hand is no farther from the hip than the elbow.
  </p>
  <p key="6fbe6865-3b41-4494-b316-5c169b8d7ac9">
   A windmill motion is done by extending your throwing hand around your body backwards and releasing the ball at about hip level at maximum speeds. In girls' fastpitch, 12u pitchers usually throw in the high 30's (mph) to mid 40's, 14u is in the low to high 40's, 16u is when you will see girls throwing 50-60 mph; with the rare being high 60's to 70mph. However, speed is not always the most important factor in fastpitch softball. Pitchers can throw balls that curve (in-Screw, out-curve), rise (straight rise, or rise screw), drop (straight drop or drop curve), as well as a change-up (slow) and fastball. A change of pace (off-speed) is also very important, good pitchers will be able to throw all their pitches at varying speeds and possibly even different pitching motions (submarine or windmill). Pitchers use deception as a primary tactic for getting batters out as the reaction times from 40' (43' for 18U and college) only provides approx .5 sec or less to react to the thrown pitch.
  </p>

   . However, in advanced play a highly-skilled pitcher may deliberately pitch a ball outside the strike zone if she believes the batter is likely to swing.  In other instances, such as when an extremely powerful hitter comes up to bat and they are followed by a weaker hitter, a pitcher may deliberately walk the first batter based on the calculation that the next batter will be an easy out. The strike zone is slightly different in different forms of softball. A pitch that passes through that zone is a

   In 16-inch softball, the pitch is lobbed. It must be thrown higher than the batter's head and pass through the strike zone. Umpires often will make calls based on where the ball lands behind the plate. A pitch in "the well" is considered a perfect pitch.

A home run includes any ball that bounces off a fielder and goes over the fence in fair-territory or that hits the foul pole. If a batted ball bounces off a fielder and goes over the fence in foul territory, hits the fence, a fielder, and then goes over, or if it goes over the fence at a location that is closer than the official distance, the batter is awarded a double instead.

   If a runner becomes entitled to the base where another runner is standing, the latter runner must advance to the next base. For example, if a player hits the ball and there is a runner on first, the runner on first must try to advance to second because the batter-runner is entitled to first base. If the batter reaches first base without being put out, then that player can then be forced to run towards second base the next time a ball is driven into fair territory. That is because the player must vacate first base to allow the next batter to reach it, and consequently can only go to second base, where a force out may be recorded.

   by running to the next base on the pitch and reaching it before being tagged with the ball. Until recently, stealing was forbidden in slow pitch because a runner would get a huge head start while the slow pitch is making its way to the batter.   As a result of rule changes initiated by the Independent Softball Association which later made its way to the Amateur Softball Association and the International Softball Federation in the 21st century, most levels of slow pitch permit stealing bases, provided the runner starts when the ball either touches the ground or crosses the plate.  This rule encourages pitchers to be more responsible with the pitch and catchers to play defense, as balls which miss the catcher are now grounds to have stolen bases.

   There are nine players out on the field at one time. Although the pitcher and catcher have the ball the most, each person has a specific job.  In the infield there is the pitcher, catcher, first base, second base, shortstop, and third base. In the outfield there is left fielder, center fielder, and right fielder. In slow pitch softball there is an extra fielder, who is specified as a rover. Normally, the defensive team will play with four outfielders, meaning there is a left fielder, left-center fielder, right-center fielder, and right fielder.

    Modification of rules
   </span>
  </h2>
  <p key="c67ff511-fa02-455d-ad69-173206c4ecc2">
   One reason for the popularity of softball is the ease of modification of the rules, thereby allowing the game to be adapted to a variety of skill levels. For example, in some slow pitch softball leagues a batter starts at bat with a count of one ball one strike.  In some leagues, the number of home runs that can be hit by a team are limited.  In other leagues, stealing of bases is prohibited.
  </p>
  <p key="b5b1eeac-5153-4331-8809-90ebacfa6004">
   Some leagues require teams to use limited flight softballs.  These softballs, when hit, will not go as far as regular softballs.  Other leagues limit the number of runs which can be scored in an inning. Five is a common limit.
  </p>
  <p key="783036b6-d97c-43e1-947c-0a3faadb12c7">
   By allowing these and other modifications, softball can be enjoyed by children, teenagers, and adults.  Senior leagues with players over the age of 60 are not uncommon.
  </p>
  <p key="43a726e7-5672-4795-b8f1-60e2bb3c5d44">
   An example of a rule modification is the "offensive pitcher" (or "self pitch") often found in informal games where the emphasis is on the social rather than the competitive aspects of the game. The pitcher aids the batter by attempting to give the easiest pitch to hit. There are no walks, and a batter is normally given a fixed number of pitches to attempt to hit (usually 3 or 4). The batter is considered to strike out if she fails to hit the ball into fair territory after the given number of pitches. The pitcher does not act as a fielder, and a rule is often made that if a batted ball touches the pitcher, the batter is out.
  </p>
  <p key="dd18e01d-e138-4347-ba93-873c84ee1888">
   In some leagues the number of pitches to walk or strikeout can be reduced. For instance, one strike is an out, and two balls is a walk. This is common in leagues where doubleheaders are played, or in late season leagues when reduced daylight is an issue.  It results in shorter games, as players are more apt to swing, even at marginal pitches, rather than risk striking out on one pitch.
  </p>
  <p key="481c880d-7867-4bbe-be40-8e519b1ca78d">
   Many leagues also include a second first base immediately adjacent to the main one.  This is usually orange and the batter running through first base is supposed to run straight through it.  This minimizes the chances of a collision.  By the same token some leagues have an alternate home plate and rule that plays at home are always force plays.  In these cases there is typically a white line drawn approximately 1/3 of the way down the baseline that is considered a point of no return.  This is designed to reduce the "Pickle"  which can put a great strain on the ankles and knees of older baserunners.

   Only the wall behind the batter is considered foul territory. The other walls are considered fair. If a ball hits a wall and is caught before it lands, the batter flies out. Usually, there is a small area on one of the walls that results in a home run being awarded if the batted ball hits it.

   alumni had gathered at the Farragut Boat Club in Chicago to hear the score of the annual football game. When the score was announced and bets were paid, a Yale alum threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The other person grabbed a stick and swung at it. Hancock called "Play ball!" and the game began. Hancock took a boxing glove and tied it into a ball. A broom handle was used as a bat.
   The first softball game ended with a score of 44-40.
   The ball, being soft, was fielded barehanded rather than with gloves like those which had been introduced to baseball in 1882. Hancock developed a ball and an undersized bat in the next week. The Farragut Club soon set rules for the game, which spread quickly to outsiders. The game, under the name of "Indoor-Outdoor", was moved outside next year, and the first rules were published in 1889.
