   In
   1973
   , Lasorda became the
   third-base coach
   on the staff of Hall of Fame manager
   Walter Alston
   , serving for almost four seasons. He was widely regarded as Alston's heir apparent, and turned down several major league managing jobs elsewhere to remain in the Dodger fold. Finally, Lasorda became the Los Angeles manager
   September 29
   ,
   1976
   upon Alston's retirement.

   1981

   1993
   , Lasorda questioned whether then-Dodger
   Pedro Martinez
   , because of his slight build, had the size and stamina to be a starting pitcher in the major leagues. Lasorda's views led the Dodgers to trade Martinez to the
   Montreal Expos
   where Pedro began to build his
