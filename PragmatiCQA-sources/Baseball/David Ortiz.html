    , Ortiz had recurring symptoms from his irregular heartbeat and was a last minute scratch in the Red Sox game at Oakland. Manager
    Terry Francona

   Ortiz began the 2008 season slumping badly. The entire month of April, he batted only .198 with 5 home runs, 3 of which he hit in the last 5 games of the month. However, by the end of May he had brought his average all the way up to .252, hitting .318 on the month. In May, he also hammered 8 home runs, bringing his total for the season up to 13. However, Ortiz partially tore the tendon sheath in his left wrist while swinging at a pitch during the
   May 31
   game against Baltimore. After meeting with team doctors, Ortiz was placed on the disabled list on
   June 2
   . Initial diagnostics were not good, with some saying Ortiz would likely miss the rest of the season. However, Ortiz was out of his cast in about 3 weeks and began baseball activities shortly thereafter.  He was activated from the DL on
   July 27
   , after a very successful rehab stint with Triple-A
   Pawtucket
   and Double-A
   Portland
   , during which he hit  2 home runs. In 6 games in July, Ortiz batted .391 with a home run and 4 RBI. However, following the
   July 31
   trade of cleanup hitter and good friend
   Manny Ramirez
   , Ortiz began a slump which saw him go 1-15 (as of
   August 4
   ) with  no home runs and a single RBI.
