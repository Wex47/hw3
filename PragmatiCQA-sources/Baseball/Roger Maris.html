   In 1961, the American League expanded from 8 to 10 teams, generally watering down the pitching, but leaving the Yankees pretty much intact.  Yankee home runs began to come at a record pace.  One famous photograph lined up six 1961 Yankee players, including

   , and
   Bill Skowron
   , under the nickname "Murderer's Row," because they hit a combined 207 home runs that year. "Murderers' Row" was actually coined in the 1920s.  As mid-season approached, it seemed quite possible that either Maris or Mantle, or perhaps both, would break Ruth's 34-year-old home run record.  Unlike the home run race of
   1998
   , in which both McGwire and Sosa were given extensive positive media coverage, sportswriters in 1961 began to play the "M &amp; M Boys" against each other, inventing a rivalry where none existed, as Yogi Berra has testified in recent interviews.

  <p key="aca7bd5b-9152-49b5-ba38-dea17a4f839a">
   Five years earlier, in
   1956
   , Mantle had already challenged Ruth's record for most of the season and the New York press had been protective of Ruth on that occasion also.  When Mantle finally fell short, finishing with 52, there seemed to be a collective sigh of relief from the New York traditionalists.  Nor had the New York press been all that kind to Mantle in his early years with the team: he struck out frequently, was injury prone, was a

   .  Over the course of time, however, Mantle (with a little help from his teammate

   , a native of New York's Borough of Queens) had gotten better at "schmoozing" with the New York media, and had gained the favor of the press.  This was a talent that Maris, a blunt-spoken upper midwesterner, never attempted to cultivate; as a result, he wore the "surly" jacket for his duration with the Yankees.
  </p>
  <p key="67fa766d-3c49-43e7-9c88-20bce9bb1c06">
   So as 1961 progressed, the Yanks were now "Mickey Mantle's team" and Maris was ostracized as the "outsider", and "not a true Yankee."  The press seemed to root for Mantle and to belittle Maris.  But Mantle was felled by a leg infection late in the season, leaving Maris as the only player with a chance to break the record.
  </p>
  <p key="41885885-9400-4ca7-a3da-fc57dbcde3f9">
   On top of his lack of popular press coverage, Maris' chase for 61 hit another roadblock totally out of his control: along with adding two teams to the league, Major League Baseball had added 8 games to the schedule.  In the middle of the season, Baseball commissioner

   announced that unless Ruth's record was broken in the first 154 games of the season, the new record would be shown in the record books as having been set in 162 games while the previous record set in 154 games would also be shown. It is an urban legend, probably invented by New York sportswriter Dick Young, that an asterisk would be used to distinguish the new record.

   .  No asterisk was subsequently used in any record books—Major League baseball itself had no official record book, and Frick later acknowledged that there never was official qualification of Maris' accomplishment.  However, Maris remained bitter about the experience. Speaking at the
   1980
   All-Star game, he said of that season, "They acted as though I was doing something wrong, poisoning the record books or something. Do you know what I have to show for 61 home runs? Nothing. Exactly nothing." Despite all the controversy, Maris was awarded the 1961

   for the top professional athlete of the year, as well as winning the American League's MVP Award for the second straight year.  It is said, however, that the stress of pursuing the record was so great for Maris that his hair occasionally fell out in clumps during the season. Later Maris even surmised that it might have been better all along had he not broken the record or even threatened it at all.
According to retrosheet play-by-play research published in 1995 (some of the original figures were in dispute), Maris led the league outright in runs scored with 132 in 1961 (Mantle had 131), and he tied for the rbi lead with Baltimore's Jim Gentile (who hit 46 home runs that year and was 3rd in MVP balloting) with 141 rbi's.
