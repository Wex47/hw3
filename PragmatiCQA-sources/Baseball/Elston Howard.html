   Tony Conigliaro
   noted, "I don't think I ever saw a pitcher shake off one of his signs. They had too much respect for him." In 1967 Howard also took over

The hit was crucial, as former teammate Maris homered in the bottom of the inning for the Cardinals before the Red Sox closed out the 3-1 win. St. Louis, however, won the Series in seven games.
