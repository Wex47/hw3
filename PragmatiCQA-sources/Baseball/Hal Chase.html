   However, despite being an excellent hitter and his reputation as a peerless defensive player, Chase's legacy was tainted by a litany of corruption.  He allegedly gambled on baseball games, and also engaged in suspicious play in order to throw (deliberately lose) games in which he played.

   , claimed that Chase was "laying down" in games.  This claim was later made by manager
   Frank Chance
   .  Yet, during this era, gambling was so rampant that whenever a player wasn't at his best, particularly in a big city such as New York, there were claims of players laying down, whether it was true or not.  Stallings' claims may have resulted from a feud between him and Chase.  While Chance allegedly made the same claim, he later told management that Chase was giving his all, but his abilities were in a state of decline.

   , talks about Chase's defensive abilities at length. He apparently made many spectacular plays that burnished his reputation as a glove wizard, but also committed 402 errors at first in just ten seasons, making his career fielding average only .980, four points below average for the period. (And since Chase was known to throw games, it's impossible to know how many of these misplays were intentional.)

    On why he bet on baseball:   "I wasn't satisfied with what the club owners paid me. Like others, I had to have a bet on the side and we used to bet with the other team and the gamblers who sat in the boxes. It was easy to get a bet. Sometimes collections were hard to make. Players would pass out IOUs and often be in debt for their entire salaries. That wasn't a healthy condition. Once the evil started there was no stopping it, and club owners were not strong enough to cope with the evil."

I lived to make great plays. What did I gain? Nothing. Everything was lost because I raised hell after hours. I was a wise guy, a know-it-all, I guess."
