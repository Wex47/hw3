Averill batted .378 in 1936, leading the American League in hits with 232, but finishing 2nd to

   After his career, he was very outspoken on being elected to the
   Hall of Fame
   . While he didn't campaign for induction, he did make the statement that if he was ever to be inducted, he didn't want it to be posthumously, and if that was the case, he wanted his family to decline the honor. He was inducted in 1975, 8 years before his passing, so he got his wish.
