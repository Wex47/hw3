   In 1946, Berra wore uniform No. 38 on the Yankees, switching to 35 the next year. In 1948, he changed to No. 8, which became well-known as his number for the rest of his career on the Yankees and

   in seven games, after which Berra was fired. It was later written that general manager
   Ralph Houk
   had been ready to discharge Berra since midseason, apparently for a perceived loss of control over the team.

   Berra made a very brief return to the field as a player-coach for the crosstown Mets, playing in just four games. His last at-bat came on May 9, 1965, just three days shy of his 40th birthday. Berra stayed with the Mets as a coach for the next eight seasons, becoming the team's manager in 1972. That same year, he was elected to the

   . The following year, his Mets won the NL East division despite winning just 82 games, and eventually lost that year's World Series in seven games. Berra remained the team's manager for two more seasons. In 1976, he rejoined the Yankees as a coach. The team won its first of three consecutive AL titles, and (as had been the case throughout his playing days) Berra was regarded as a lucky charm. Berra was eventually elevated to Yankee manager before the 1984 season. Berra agreed to stay in the job for 1985 after receiving assurances that he would not be fired, but the impatient Steinbrenner did fire Berra after the 16th game of the season. This caused a rift between the two men that would not be mended for almost 15 years.

The Museum is currently the home of various collector's items, including the mitt with which Yogi caught the only perfect game in World Series history, several autographed and "game-used" items, three World Series Championship trophies, and all of Yogi's championship rings. It was an appearance on behalf of the Museum by George Steinbrenner that led to their ultimate reconciliation. Berra is very involved with the project and frequents the museum for signings, discussions, and other events. It is his vision to teach children important values such as sportsmanship and dedication both on and off the field of play. When asked "So, what is it you do here?"
