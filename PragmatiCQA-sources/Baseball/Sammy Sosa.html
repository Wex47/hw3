   In May 2004, Sosa suffered a strange injury. While sitting next to his locker chatting with reporters before a game in San Diego's
   PETCO Park
   , he sneezed violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the
   disabled list
   . Later, he fell into one of the worst slumps of his career, only snapping out of it in the last week of the season. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years.
  </p>
  <p key="a202fef8-9e11-4448-b4a6-4cc58af6c82d">
   Sosa's actions in the last game of the 2004 season raised many eyebrows, and eventually led to his departure from Chicago. Going into the last game, the Cubs had lost seven of eight games to fall out of contention for a playoff berth. Sosa had already been told that he would not be in the starting lineup for that game, and arrived at
   <a href="Wrigley Field.html" key="5768a3dd-0702-4309-8e2d-24f71a6e2cb5" title="Wrigley Field">

   only an hour before game time; this was a violation of team rules. He then left Wrigley without permission during the game, claiming to reporters afterwards that he left in the seventh inning. However, a surveillance video proved that Sosa had left the stadium 15 minutes after the game started. Several days later, the Cubs fined him one game's pay (approximately $87,000).
  </p>
  <p key="703df57f-afdf-4161-916d-fa62d5bbfd01">
   After his teammates learned of the departure that day, they decided to vent their frustration on Sosa's trademark

   that he kept in his locker. For several seasons, Sosa was notorious for monopolizing the music in the locker room (it's normally the custom in the majors for the team's starting pitcher that day to select the music that is played in the locker that day). He would superstitiously play pop music deemed undesirable by most of his teammates or salsa music at a very high volume, often refusing to turn it down (even on one occasion when then-teammate
   Joe Girardi
   was suffering from a
   <span class="new" data-uncrawlable-url="L3dpa2kvTWlncmFpbmU/YWN0aW9uPWVkaXQmcmVkbGluaz0x" key="ca85e2be-71ec-4b97-a228-89228f7ad21b" title="Migraine (page does not exist)">

   ). One of Sosa's teammates destroyed the boombox with a bat. Many speculate that Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood was the boombox destroyer. That action was viewed as symbolic of the end of Sosa's era with the Cubs.
  </p>
  <p key="40104b9b-6694-47b5-94d6-598f47a2f1e1">
   By then, most observers considered Sosa to be declining as a player, as he was the only player in Major League Baseball whose batting average, home runs, and RBI all declined in each year since 2001. It has been speculated by many members of the media and fans about the possibility of steroid use by Sosa due to the dramatic statistical swings throughout his career.
   Others noted that Sosa's production went into a tailspin immediately after he was hit in the head by a Salomon Torres pitch in April 2003, and never recovered to former levels.
  </p>
  <p key="a73a0c10-183d-4757-ac38-09efdcc79eb6">
   Although no evidence of steroid use by Sosa has ever been found, following suspicions of PED use and his late-2004 actions, the Cubs were generally regarded as eager to trade him. However, the structure of his contract made this problematic. Sosa had one year left on his contract, with a team option for a second year. His salary would be $17 million in 2005, and was to rise to $18 million in 2006. However, the contract also stipulated that if Sosa was traded during the duration of the deal, the team option would be waived, making his 2006 salary guaranteed, and adding a $19 million option for 2007.

   indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17,875,000 for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles, with 500 home run hitter
   Rafael Palmeiro
   , Sosa and Palmeiro became the first
   500 home run club
   members in history to play together on the same team after reaching their 500 home run marks.

   After a great deal of preseason hype from Sosa and Orioles management, Sosa had a modest start to the season, which was followed by terrible slumps during mid-season. His trademark home run hop (which once signaled a sure home run) was now followed by mostly a lot of long fly ball outs. The slumps caused then Orioles manager

   to drop Sosa as low as the 7th spot in the lineup. When Sosa's slump continued, Mazzilli resorted to benching Sosa. Sosa eventually returned to the lineup and while the slumps did subside somewhat, he still had problems producing as a hitter. Toward the end of the 2005 season, Sosa had another mysterious injury and spent a great deal of time away from the team.

   Sosa finished the season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, and RBI. On

   2006
   , Sosa's agent Adam Katz stated: "We're not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time."

   Sosa is not guaranteed a spot on Texas' 40-man roster, so it is possible that he will not play an actual major league game for them. Sosa's contract allows him to elect for free agency on March 15 if he is not added to the major league team by then.
