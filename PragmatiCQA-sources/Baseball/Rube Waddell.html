   However, he was odd and unpredictable: Waddell had a habit of leaving the dugout in the middle of games to follow passing fire trucks to fires, and performed as an alligator wrestler in the offseason.  He was an alcoholic for much of his adult life, reportedly spending the entirety of his first signing bonus on a drinking binge (
   <i key="735ee1b5-e7bb-4fa7-ab0f-d77fb5d0181b">

   called him "the sousepaw").  Waddell's eccentric behavior led to constant battles with his managers and scuffles with bad-tempered teammates; complaints from his teammates forced his trade from Philadelphia to St. Louis in early 1908, despite his importance to the team and his continued success. Recent commentators (such as

    "In my opinion, and I suppose if there is any subject that I am qualified to discuss it is pitching, Rube Waddell had more sheer pitching ability than any man I ever saw. That doesn't say he was the greatest pitcher, by a good deal. Rube had defects of character that prevented him from using his talents to the best effect. He is dead and gone, so there is no need for me to enlarge on his weaknesses. They were well enough known. I would prefer to dwell on his strong points. And he had plenty."

   Because of his troubles with alcohol and erratic nature, Waddell's career was checkered.  His first pro contract was with Louisville (for $500), though he only pitched two games with the team at the end of the 1897 season.  When the season was over, he was loaned to the Detroit Wolverines of the Western League to gain professional seasoning.
  </p>
  <p key="98bfdc81-30c5-4cf6-8127-3ca36120f6bb">
   Waddell left his next team, Detroit of the Western League, to pitch in Canada before eventually returning to Homestead, PA to pitch semi-pro baseball there.  He pitched for Columbus of the Western League in 1899, continued with the team when the franchise moved mid-season to Grand Rapids, and finished with a record of 26-8.  He rejoined Louisville in the final month of the 1899 season and won seven of nine decisions.  When the National League contracted to eight teams for the 1900 season, Louisville lost its franchise.  Louisville's top players, included Waddell, were transferred to Pittsburgh.

   in 1900, leading the
   National League
   in ERA.  But his erratic behavior led manager Fred Clarke to suspend him.  After pitching semi-pro ball in small towns such as Punxsatawney, Connie Mack learned of Waddell's availability, and with Pittsburgh's approval, convinced Waddell to pitch for Milwaukee for several weeks in the summer of 1900.  Milwaukee was in the newly-organized American League, which was not yet a direct or legitimate competitor to the NL.  When Waddell displayed his prowess for Milwaukee, Pittsburgh asked for Rube to be returned to the club.  By 1901, Waddell had worn out his welcome and his contract was sold to the Cubs, who ended up suspending him for the last month of the season-- which Waddell promptly spent pitching for a semi-pro team in Wisconsin.  Waddell then joined a

   team that travelled to California.  While there, Waddell was convinced to stay and joined the Los Angeles Loo Loos in a league that one year later would become the Pacific Coast League.  Connie Mack, now in Philadelphia, was desperate for pitching, and when he learned Rube was pitching in California, he dispatched two Pinkerton agents to sneak Waddell to Philadelphia, where he would lead the
   Philadelphia Athletics
   to the 1902 American League crown.

    Jimmy Austin has claimed that, in 1909, he hit a home run off of a tipsy Waddell who then glared angrily at him during his entire trot around the bases.  However, maintaining the 360-degree pivot made Waddell dizzy, and he passed out on the mound.  Evidence indicates, however, that this story could not have happened as Jimmy Austin described it
    .  Austin likely merged three different games against Waddell into one memory.  In their first meeting, Austin banged out a triple to the deepest part of centerfield in the first inning, but was stranded by Waddell, who retired the rest of the batters in order.  In their second meeting, Waddell was removed from a game after being hit by a batted ball.  In their third meeting, Austin likely faced a Waddell who had been bored by playing for a poor Browns club.  In that game, Austin batted with runners on first and second and bunted.  Rube twisted as he threw to third - and got the force out.  However, he feigned injury and appeared less than cooperative to manager Jimmy McAleer, so McAleer pulled Waddell from the game.  Oddly, Austin was removed from the bases when he tried to advance an extra base on a single to left field.
