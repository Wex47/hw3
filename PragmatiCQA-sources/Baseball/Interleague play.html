   . But while regular season interleague play was discussed for baseball's major leagues as early as the 1930s, the concept didn't take hold until the 1990s (at least in part as an effort to renew the public's interest in MLB following the controversial

   From
   1997
   to
   2001
   , teams from the American League West played teams from the National League West, etc., typically scheduled to alternate between home and away in consecutive years. However, in
   2002
   , the league began alternating which divisions would play which divisions, and thus in 2002 the American League East played the National League West, the American League Central played the National League East, and the American League West played the National League Central. Matchups which had been of particular interest prior to this format — mainly geographic rivals — were preserved. This is expected to be the continuing format of the interleague schedule though corresponding divisions were integrated in this rotation in
   2006
   .

   (DH) rule is applied in the same manner as in the World Series and the All-Star Game. In an American League ballpark, both teams use a DH to hit for the pitcher. In a National League ballpark, both teams' pitchers must bat. Some baseball observers feel it might be fairer to reverse this (in other words, always follow the DH rule of the visiting team instead of the home team), thereby offsetting the home-field advantage.

    Since a few more games are played against non-divisional opponents than before, there is a better chance for a last place team to catch up with the teams in front of it in its own division, even with very few games remaining in the season.  Combined with the divisional realignment of 1994 (which now sends three divisional winners and one wild card from each league to the post-season), more teams remain in the running to qualify for the post-season, and they remain in the running longer.  In other words, teams are less likely to be mathematically eliminated as early in the season as they used to be, so fan interest is probably stronger.

    With the two leagues not having the same number of teams, and with one division (the National League Central) containing six teams while another (the American League West) has only four (the other two divisions in both leagues consisting of five teams each), various irregularities in scheduling result. Most notably, teams no longer play identical opponents as their divisional rivals, and even where they do, they don't always play them an identical number of times. This can lead to "strength of schedule" disparities like those the

    has to deal with on a yearly basis. For example, in any given season, one NL Central team might play every AL East team except the (strong) first place team, while another NL Central team plays all but the (weak) last place team. Another scheduling problem is that because the leagues are not equal in size, there always has to be one national league game on interleague days (interleague is done with block scheduling like the NHL, so all the teams play interleague games on the same day, and all the interleague games are played in one part of the schedule (third weekend of may and most of June)

    The "rivalry" series that consist of six games a year for some teams leads to further scheduling inequities.  For example, the Chicago Cubs play the recently solid Chicago White Sox six times a year, while their division rival St. Louis Cardinals play the recently poor Kansas City Royals six times a year.
