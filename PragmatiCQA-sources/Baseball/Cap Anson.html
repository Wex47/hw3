   The White Stockings won the first league title, but fell off the pace the following two seasons. During this time, Anson was a solid hitter, but not quite a superstar. Both his fortunes and those of his team would change after Anson was named captain-manager of the club in 1879, hence the nickname "Cap",
   although the newspapers typically called him by the more formal "Captain Anson" or "Capt. Anson". With Anson pacing the way, the White Stockings won five pennants between
   1880
   and
   1886
   . They were helped to the titles using new managerial tactics, including using a third-base coach, having one fielder back up another, signaling batters, and the rotation of two star pitchers.
   In the first half of the 1880s, aided by speedy players like
   Mike Kelly
   , Anson had his players aggressively run the bases, forcing the opposition into making errors. After the expression first became popular, in the 1890s, he retroactively claimed to used some of the first "hit and run" plays.
  </p>
  <p key="beaacbd4-b43b-4bd3-9f28-a1efc1976ee6">
   Anson shares credit as an innovator of modern
   spring training
   along with then-Chicago President
   Albert Spalding
   , as they were among the first to send their clubs to warmer climes in the South to prepare for the season.
   On the field, Anson was the team's best hitter and run producer. In the 1880s, he won two batting titles (1881, 1888) and finished second four times (1880, 1882, 1886-87). During the same period, he led the league in RBIs seven times (1880-82, 1884-86, 1888). His best season was in 1881, when he led the league in batting (.399), OBP (.442), OPS (.952), hits (137), total bases (175), and
   RBIs
   (82). He also became the first player to hit three consecutive
   home runs
   , five homers in two games, and four doubles in a game, as well as being the first to perform two unassisted
   double plays
   in a game. He is one of only a few players to score six runs in a game, a feat accomplished on
   August 24
   ,
   1886
   .

  <p key="76e9aff4-7f27-4f37-ad2e-639b382c738f">
   Anson signed a ten-year contract in 1888 to manage the White Stockings (which, because of a typographical error he failed to spot, ended after the 1897 season instead of 1898),
   but his best years were behind him. He led the league in walks in 1890 and garnered his eighth and final RBI crown in
   1891
   , but declined precipitously thereafter. On the managerial front, he failed to win another pennant.

   in 1890, what little talent the club still had was drained away, and the team nickname "Colts", though never official, became standard usage in the local media

   lured Anson to the Chicago team, which Spalding now managed.
   After signing the contract, Anson had second thoughts (his future wife did not want to leave her family in Philadelphia), and offered Spalding $1,000 to void the contract.
   Spalding held Anson to the contract, and Anson came to Chicago in March, 1876.

   Spalding retired as a player and manager after the 1877 season, but continued as secretary, and later president, of the White Stockings.
   Anson became a player/manager of the team in 1879, and by 1889 had a 13% ownership.

   In 1888 Spalding announced that the White Stockings, including Anson, and a "picked nine"
   from the rest of the National League would begin a World Tour after the end of the season. Spalding put up most of the money, but Anson invested $3,750 of his own.
   James Hart was hired as business manager and Anson developed an intense dislike for him.

  <p key="d1f1bf57-7131-4a27-868d-fa6cf3baac01">
   After the Spalding stepped down as president of the Chicago club in 1891, he appointed James Hart to the position,

   Spalding, however, continued to run the club behind the scenes.

  <p key="e81dd37b-3bd4-4d2b-a504-0512813ac863">
   In December 1892, Hart, with Spalding's blessing, reorganized the White Stockings into a stock company.
   Anson was required to sign a new contract, which ended in 1898 instead of 1899 as the previous one had.
   Anson spotted the error later but said nothing, trusting that Spalding would honor the previous terms.
  </p>
  <p key="22cd92ab-bc39-45d6-a7de-91a2ad9ac9b3">
   Hart began to undermine Anson's managerial decisions by reversing fines and suspensions imposed by Anson.
   By 1897 Anson had little control over his players; after Anson demanded a sportswriter print that Anson thought "the Chicago ball club is composed of drunkards and loafers who are throwing him down",
   his days as manager were numbered. Spalding invited Anson and his wife on a four week journey to England in late November 1897.
   Spalding dropped many hints on the voyage, encouraging Anson to voluntarily retire, but Anson had no intention of doing so.
   Things remained in limbo until
   January 29
   1898
   when the Associated Press printed a statement by Spalding: "I have taken pains as a mediator to find out from Chicagoans how they feel about a change of management. There has been a decided undercurrent in favor... Lovers of baseball think that Anson has been in power too long."
