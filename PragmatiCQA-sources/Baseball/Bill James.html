   writer, historian and statistician whose work has been widely influential. Since 1977, James has written more than two dozen books devoted to baseball history and statistics. His approach, which he termed
   sabermetrics
   in reference to the
   Society for American Baseball Research
   (SABR), scientifically evaluates statistical data in attempting to determine why teams win and lose. In 2006, Time magazine named him in the Time 100 as one of the most influential people in the world.

   After four years at the University of Kansas and one course short of graduating, James joined the United States Army in
   1971
   . James was the last person in Kansas to be drafted for the Vietnam war, although he never saw action there. Instead, he spent two years stationed in South Korea, during which time he wrote to KU about taking his final class. He was told he actually had met all his graduation requirements, so he returned to Lawrence in
   1973
   with degrees in English and economics. He also finished an Education degree in
   1975
   , likewise from the University of Kansas.

   An aspiring writer and obsessive fan, James began writing baseball articles after leaving the United States Army in his mid-twenties. Many of his first baseball writings came while he was doing nightshifts as a security guard. Unlike most writers, his pieces didn't recount games in epic terms or offer insights gleaned from interviews with players. A typical James piece posed a question (e.g., "Which pitchers and catchers allow runners to steal the most bases?") and then presented data and analysis written in a lively, insightful and witty style, that answered the question.

  <p key="3f7eb2df-5dc2-46da-b3df-a5c02b572380">
   Editors considered James' pieces so unusual that few believed them suitable for their readers. In an effort to reach a wider audience, James self-published an annual book titled

   For most of his career, James' ideas have either been ignored or rejected by professional baseball teams. James' sabermetrics rejects much of the conventional wisdom that has been passed down by players, executives, and writers over decades. Most teams, managers, and players prefer to continue to follow maxims that were developed decades ago, as well as their gut instincts.

   . The move generated some controversy, but after 25 years James had finally gained an official position within Major League Baseball.  Current Red Sox GM
   Theo Epstein
   also turned out to have a sabermetric bent.
  </p>
  <p key="642ea482-474e-4882-89ca-182f72f5980b">
   One point of controversy was in handling the Red Sox' relief pitching.  James had previously published several analyses of the use of the
   closer
   in baseball, and had concluded that the traditional use of the closer both overrated the abilities of that individual, and used him in suboptimal circumstances.  Reportedly, James influenced a reorganization of the Boston bullpen, with several moderately talented relievers and no clear closer.  When Boston lost a number of games due to bullpen failures, they were forced to acquire a traditional closer (
   Byung-Hyun Kim
   ) in order to address the issue. Many writers considered this to be a rejection of James' ideas, and the signing of ace reliever
   Keith Foulke
   following the season further suggests this.  Others, however, argue that the Boston pen was simply not very talented and that the outcome doesn't necessarily undermine James' arguments.
  </p>
  <p key="04a865e4-8bf3-4ff2-9610-c5e0972c4ab7">
   It should be noted that Boston did not implement James' idea of the "relief ace". James did not suggest a "bullpen by committee"; rather, his studies showed that the relief ace should be used in close or tie games as early as the 7th inning, when the outcome of a ballgame is really decided. Boston had no relief ace in 2003.  During the
   2004
   regular season Foulke was used primarily as a closer in the
   Tony La Russa
   model; however, Foulke's usage in the 2004 postseason was along the lines of a relief ace with multiple inning appearances at pivotal times of the game.

   manager
   Phil Garner
   also employed a relief ace model, perhaps unwittingly, with his use of
