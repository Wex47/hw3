   Smoltz continue to post excellent statistics in
   1998

   1999

   Tommy John surgery

   In

   Eric Gagne

   2003
   , but he still recorded 45 saves with a minuscule 1.12 ERA. He only allowed eight earned runs in 64.3 innings pitched. In
   2004
   , Smoltz finished with 44 saves, but was frustrated with his inability to make an impact as a closer during another Braves' post-season loss.

   . Because of poor run support, Smoltz would lose his next two decisions despite pitching well. After these initial difficulties, things would fall into place. At the All-Star break, Smoltz was 9-5 with an ERA of 2.68, better than his career average. As a result,

   selected Smoltz as a member of the 2005 NL All-Star team. Smoltz gave up a solo home run to

   Smoltz finished the 2005 season 14-7 with a 3.06 ERA with 169 strikeouts while allowing only 210 hits in 229 2/3 innings. Before the season began, many questioned whether Smoltz would be able to reach the 200 inning plateau in his return to the rotation. While the number of innings he logged during the season was impressive, it caused him to wear down towards the end of the season.

   In
   2006
   , Smoltz continued his re-emergence as one of the elite starting pitchers in the game. Although Smoltz still features a fastball clocked at up to 95-96 MPH and one of the game's best sliders, he has utilized a curveball more so than in years past. Smoltz finished the season with a record of 16-9, an earned run average of 3.49, and 211 strikeouts. He was tied for the National League lead in wins, and finished a close third-best in strikeouts. His record would have been even better if not for six blown saves by the much-maligned Braves bullpen.

   On
   September 21
   ,
   2006
   , the Braves announced they had picked up Smoltz's eight million dollar contract option for the
   2007 season
   . He will continue to serve as a veteran leader for the Braves. Smoltz's future beyond '07, however, remains up in the air. While he has stated his desire to finish his career in Atlanta on numerous occasions, the Braves' payroll limitations left the possibility open that he could sign elsewhere following the season. Smoltz eventually did re-sign with the Braves for the
   2008
   season, but went through surgury early in the season and was sidelined for the rest of the year.

Atlanta apparently would not offer more than $3 million in guaranteed money. Smoltz also saw Boston as having more of a chance of making the World Series in what likely will be his final season. Smoltz later revealed that both the
