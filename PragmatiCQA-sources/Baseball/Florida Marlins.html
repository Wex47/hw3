   With the addition of Delgado, the Marlins were expected to finish the
   2005
   season in either first or second place in the NL East by many sportswriters. However, at the All-Star break they were 44-42, and the NL East was unusually competitive, as all five of its teams had a winning record at the break. As a result, the Marlins were criticized for underachieving in the first half of the season. While Cabrera, Willis, and several others posted very good first-half numbers, Lowell was one of the worst offensive producers among regular major-league starters, and Leiter went 3-7 with an

   Entering the 2012 season the Florida Marlins will be known as the Miami Marlins.
  </p>
  <p key="9ca25769-6def-4c3b-babf-b4427b17c89c">
   The Marlins signed former Padres closer Heath Bell, former White Sox starter Mark Buehrle, and former Mets shortstop Jose Reyes. They traded for former Cubs starter Carlos Zambrano. Expectations were high entering the 2012 season.Their 1st game in the new stadium was 4/4/12 vs the St. Louis Cardinals in a game they lost 4-1. Unfortunately, this didn't work and they got 4th place (?) in the NL East. They then had a fire sale and traded everyone of value away.
