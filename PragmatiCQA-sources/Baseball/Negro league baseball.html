He studied the mechanics of his pitchers and could spot the smallest flaw, turning his average pitchers into learned craftsmen.

In midsummer of 1945, Rickey, almost ready with his Robinson plan, pulled out of the league.  The league folded after the end of the

Young players with enough talent were signed by major league teams, often without regard for any contracts that might have been signed with Negro League clubs.

So the Negro Leagues, once among the largest and most prosperous black-owned business ventures, were allowed to fade into oblivion.

   At first, the Hall of Fame planned a "separate but equal" display, which would be similar to the Ford Frick award for baseball commentators, in that this plan meant that the Negro League honorees would not be considered members of the Hall of Fame. This plan was criticized by the press, the fans and the players it was intended to honor and Satchel Paige himself insisted that he would not accept anything less than full fledged induction in to the Hall of Fame. The Hall relented and agreed to admit Negro League players on an equal basis with their Major League counterparts in
