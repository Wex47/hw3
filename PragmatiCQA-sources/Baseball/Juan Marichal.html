   Marichal's delivery was renowned for one of the fullest windups in modern baseball, with a high kick of his left leg that went nearly vertical (even more so than
   Warren Spahn
   's delivery). Marichal maintained this delivery his entire career, and photographs taken near his retirement show the vertical kick only slightly diminished. The windup was the key to his delivery in that he was consistently able to conceal the type of pitch until it was on its way. The kick also served to disrupt the batter's timing.

   Marichal was discovered by Ramfis Trujillo, the son of late Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. Ramfis was the primary sponsor of the Dominican Air Force Baseball Team (Aviacion Dominicana), which Marichal pitched a 2-1 victory game in his native Monte Cristi. From the very moment the game ended, Marichal was a member of Aviacion Dominicana team, drafted into the Air Force right on the spot by Ramfis' orders.

   Many people in Los Angeles protested the apparently light punishment meted out, but as it was it hurt the Giants significantly. They were in a neck-and-neck pennant race with the Dodgers and the race was decided with only two games to play. Marichal's nine-day suspension, along with being barred from the Los Angeles trip, cost him at least three pitching turns, and forced the Giants to juggle their rotation to compensate. The Giants, who ended up winning the August 22 game and were down by 2 1/2 games afterward, eventually lost the pennant by 2 games. Marichal also lost his last three decisions. However, slugger

   In 1970, Marichal experienced a severe allergic reaction to penicillin (following an ear infection incurred in Japan) which led to back pain and chronic arthritis. Marichal's career stumbled in
   1970
   , when he only posted 12 wins and his ERA shot up to 4.12, before straightening itself out with a stellar
   1971
   season in which he won 18 games and his ERA dropped below 3.00. It was his final great season, however, as he posted 6-16 and 11-15 records in

His teams appeared in two postseasons (in 1962 and 1971) but were not victorious in either series against the New York Yankees and Pittsburgh Pirates, respectively. Between 1962 and 1971, the Giants averaged 90 wins a season, and Marichal averaged 20 wins a year.
