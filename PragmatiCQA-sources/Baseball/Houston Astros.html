   1964
   the Harris County Domed Stadium was officially named the Astrodome after the Houston club changed its nickname,

  </p>
  <p key="68cb9ca0-d087-42f1-87de-d54f636412e3">
   Regardless of trade mark issues, "Astros" was a good fit for the futuristic ambiance of the revolutionary domed stadium and also since Houston was by then the home of NASA's astronaut program.  The scoreboard retained subliminal references to the old nickname, as it featured electronically animated cowboys firing pistols, with the "bullets" ricocheting around the scoreboard, when an Astros player would hit a home run. Early on, the groundskeepers also wore imitation spacesuits to promote that futuristic image.
  </p>
  <p key="281ab163-775f-4884-b4fa-ea8338568605">
   As a condition of their entry in the National League, the Astros committed to building a new domed stadium, designed as a defense against the oppressive heat and humidity of the Houston summer. The result was the Astrodome.

   , the Astrodome was a multi-purpose stadium, designed for both football and baseball. However, because it was enclosed, it could also be used for events traditionally held in indoor arenas, such as basketball, concerts and political conventions, allowing outdoor-sized crowds in an indoor venue.
  </p>
  <p key="ab7fbf85-15a4-41ef-bb29-9dc54abe7393">
   Besides its roof, the Astrodome was revolutionary for a number of other reasons. It was one of the first stadiums to have individual, theatre-type seats for every seat in the venue. Additionally, it was one of the first stadiums to have luxury seats and club seating, at the time a relatively new concept in sports venues. It also had an "exploding scoreboard", which would show various animations after a home run or a win, as well as messages and advertising.

   The Astrodome was also one of the first stadiums in the country to use an artificial playing surface. The creation of an artificial surface came across based on necessity. Originally the Astrodome had a grass field and a transparent roof. However, during the
   1965
   season, players and fans complained about the glare on the field which detracted from the game. As a result, the roof was painted black.  This solved the glare problem but killed off the grass. As a solution the Astros deployed a product from Monsanto Corporation called
