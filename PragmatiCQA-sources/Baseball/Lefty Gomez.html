   , she gave up her career in 1936.  By 1937 the marriage was on shaky ground.  Apparently in an effort to rekindle their relationship, they sailed to Bermuda in January, returning to New York aboard the Monarch of Bermuda on the twenty-seventh.
   It evidently didn’t help much, as Lefty traveled to Hollywood that April and June returned to Massachusetts to stay with family.  Through the tabloids, she learned in December that Lefty was filing divorce papers in Mexico, charging incompatibility.  Being a devout Catholic, June refused a divorce but agreed to a formal separation, citing abandonment and cruel and inhuman treatment.
   Publically, Lefty said the whole idea of divorce was absurd, but after the first of the year he moved to Reno to get a six-week divorce.  It was his intention for the divorce to be finalized by the time he began spring training in Florida.
   Separation proceedings continued for months, but was called off in May 1938.
   Lefty and June went on to have two daughters, Vernona and Sharon, and one son named Gary.

   In 1940, Lefty suffered an arm injury, which left him up for grabs by another team, but in 1941 he played fairly well, winning 15 and losing 5.  During that season, he was said to be a great starting pitcher, but won through the support of Johnny Murphy, who relieved him in later innings.  After the 1942 season ended, Lefty took a job as a dispatcher with the General Electric River Works, a defense plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, which only paid $40 a week.  Then on January 27, 1943, the Yankees sold Lefty to the Boston Braves for $10,000.

   During the 1960s, he often coached children at the Carquinez Grammar School in Crockett, which is situated just east of Rodeo.  At thet time, Rodeo didn't have a school but he wanted to do something for the kids.  Pushing sixty, he had not lost his sense of humor and entertained the children as much with his anecdotes as his coaching and lectures on sportsmanship.
   On one occasion, Joe Grokett, a first grade student, decided to steal first base, which he did, zigzagging arounnd the outfield with the base close to his chest until the other kids caught up with him.  They pounded him half to death while Lefty, seated calmly on the bleachers, monitored the incident  with interest.  After the beating, Lefty waved Grokett over to him to lecture him on good sportsmanship.  Grokett listened intently, and then remarked to the veteran ballplayer, "Shouldn't you be telling that to them?"
   On February 2, 1972, the Veterans Committee  selected Lefty Gomez for the National Baseball Hall of Fame, along with Giants outfielder Ross Youngs and former American League President Will Haridge.  The Committee noted that Lefty pitched in five World Series games and never lost one.  Wearing a Yankee cap, Gomez became the 2nd Hispanic player (of Hispanic descent) to be inducted.
