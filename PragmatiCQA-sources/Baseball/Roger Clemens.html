The Red Sox opted not to re-sign him following the 1996 season. However, the full quote from which "twilight" is excerpted was not entirely negative, and also referred to Red Sox management's stated hopes that Clemens would spend his entire career with Boston.

   .  During a
   July 8
   , 2000 game between the Mets and the Yankees, Clemens hit Piazza squarely in the head with a pitch. Piazza had previously enjoyed great success as a hitter against Clemens (including a

   against Clemens one month earlier), which was widely seen as Clemens' motivation.  The incident and its aftermath received intense media coverage.  Piazza bitterly criticized Clemens, while the Mets were assailed for not "protecting" their star catcher (retaliating by hitting an important Yankee batter).  And when both the Yankees and the Mets reached that year's

  </p>
  <p key="d82df7ab-42ad-4acc-8a9d-068b053ba031">
   In Piazza's first at-bat of Game 2, his bat shattered, sending a large piece of the broken bat shard flying in Clemens' direction.  Clemens picked it up and threw the broken bat down toward the first base line, missing Piazza but clearing the benches of both teams.  Clemens later claimed that he was "fielding" the broken bat, having mistaken it for the baseball.  His explanation was widely ridiculed
   , in part because pitchers fielding baseballs hit in fair territory do not typically throw them towards the home plate side of their dugout.  Mets pitcher
   Al Leiter
   said, "If he felt that way, shouldn't he have thrown it to Tino (Yankee first baseman

   During the subsequent faceoff, both Clemens and Piazza appeared hesitant to confront one another. Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe compared the situation to two schoolyard bullies, afraid to fight, but suddenly forced to.  Clemens was not ejected from the game, although he would later be fined $50,000. Following the bizarre incident, he proceeded to shut down the Mets with 8 innings of 2-hit, no-walk, 9-strikeout pitching.

   in 2000.  With Clemens batting against the Mets for the first time, the game represented the Mets' first risk-free chance to "get even" with Clemens for his nearly two-year-old beanball.  The speculation was that Clemens was certain to be plunked; the reality was more ambivalent.  Mets starter
   Shawn Estes
   threw a pitch behind Clemens' back, failing to satisfy the crowd and drawing an umpire's warning (thus preventing Estes from making another HBP attempt).  However, the Mets scored four runs off Clemens, including home runs by the two Met principals Estes and Piazza, and handed Clemens the loss.

In Game 4 of the NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, he made a dramatic emergency relief appearance, entering as a pinch-hitter (the first pinch-hitting appearance of his career), then pitching the 16th through 18th innings and collecting the series-ending win. However, during the
   World Series
   , a hamstring pull ended Clemens's start after two innings, as his hometown team lost 5-3. It was Clemens's only World Series appearance for the Astros.

   Clemens has been the focal point of several controversies. His reputation has always been that of a pitcher unafraid to throw close to batters. Clemens led his league in hit batsmen only once, in 1995, but he has been among the leaders in several other seasons. This tendency was more pronounced during his earlier career, and has since tapered off. Still, Clemens's reputation precedes him. After the 2000 ALCS game against the Mariners where he knocked down

   , followed by the notorious broken-bat incident in the World Series, cemented Clemens's surly, unapologetic image in the minds of many detractors. Clemens was 12th all time in hit batsmen after the 2006 season,
   though it has been pointed out that this is consistent with a long-time pitcher who uses the entire plate. Nevertheless, before his signing with the Astros, Clemens had long been accused of hitting batters because he had the luxury of being an American League pitcher who rarely went to bat himself.
   In 2004-5, Clemens hit 9 batters in 426 innings, a notable reduction in his HBP rate. Clemens has been hit by a pitch twice in his career, in 2005 by
   Kip Wells
   and in 2006 by

   , Clemens made a racially insensitive remark when asked about the devotion of Japanese and South Korean fans during the World Baseball Classic: "None of the dry cleaners were open, they were all at the game, Japan and Korea."
   Toward the beginning of his career, his postseason failures with the Red Sox led to him being branded in some quarters as an October "choke artist"; toward the end, his annual on-and-off "retirements" have revived a reputation for diva-ish behavior.
