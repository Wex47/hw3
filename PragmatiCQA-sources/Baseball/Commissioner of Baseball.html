   Subsequent Commissioners wielded varying degrees of power with varying degrees of success.  An important aspect of the office is that, while charged with defending the "best interests of baseball", the Commissioner was always elected by baseball team owners alone, and thus is not directly answerable to players, umpires, or fans.  Still, there are a number of occasions on which the Commissioner has made decisions unpopular with the owners to defend the "best interests of baseball," such as when

   Selig continued under the title of Acting Commissioner until 1998, when he divested himself from active involvement in the Brewers and became Commissioner in full.  Having been an owner himself for 30 years, Selig is seen as much less of an independent authority than were previous commissioners.  His ascent was soon followed by the disastrous
