   for several years prior to Wills' insurgence, Wills brought new prominence to the tactic.
   Perhaps this was due to greater media exposure in Los Angeles, or to the Dodgers' greater success, or to their extreme reliance on a low-scoring strategy that emphasized pitching, defense, and Wills' speed to compensate for their lack of productive hitters. Wills was a significant distraction to the pitcher even if he didn't try to steal, because he was a constant threat to do so.
   The fans at
   Dodger Stadium
   would chant, "Go! Go! Go!" anytime he got on base.
   A winner of the
   Gold Glove Award
   in 1961 and 1962, Wills was selected five times for the
   All-Star Game
