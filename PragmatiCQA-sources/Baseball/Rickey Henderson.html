   's last major league game, Rickey garnered his 3,000th career hit.  He had originally wanted to sit out the game so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.  At the age of 42, his last substantial major league season, Henderson finished the 2001 season with 25 stolen bases, 9th in the NL.  It is a measure of his skill and longevity that his 25 steals increased his existing lead on all nine of the other Top 10 active stolen base leaders.  It also marked Rickey Henderson's 23rd consecutive season in which he'd stolen more than 20 bases.

   Henderson was quoted as recently as May of 2005, still insisting that he is capable of playing in the major leagues.  Contrary to what some believe, Henderson's refusal to retire is not delaying his eligibility for

   Henderson's playing style has one especially unusual feature: he throws left-handed and bats right-handed. Many right-handed throwers bat left-handed, but the opposite is extremely rare, especially among non-pitchers. Another left-handed thrower who batted right-handed was former Yale baseball player and President George H. W. Bush. Explaining how that happened, Rickey once said, "All the other kids playing around me were batting right-handed, so that's the way I thought you were supposed to do it, so that's what I did, too. At one point, I wanted to be a switch-hitter and try the left side, but I was hitting .300, .350 in the minors, and they (the

   , for referring to himself in the third-person (for example, calling Padres GM Kevin Towers to inquire about a contract and leaving a message starting "this is Rickey, calling on behalf of Rickey."), and for talking to himself at length when he is up to bat.  He has been known to speak to his bats, asking them which one has the next hit inside them.  He once fell asleep on an icepack, thereby contracting a case of frostbite in August.  In 2001, he described a long single this way:  "I hit it out, but it didn't go out." Another time, Rickey was offered a seat on the team bus, the player saying that he had tenure.  To which Rickey replied, "Ten years?  What are you talking about?  Rickey got 16, 17 years."
  </p>
  <p key="63d6fb55-69f7-4128-ab2d-68bb91c1af24">
   Another story occurred while Henderson was playing for the Oakland A's.  Team bookkeepers could not account for a $1 million discrepancy in their finances.  The mysterious figure was eventually traced to Henderson, who had received the sum as a signing bonus.  Instead of cashing the check, he'd had it framed, where it still hung on his wall.
  </p>
  <p key="b54dfe63-1ece-41fa-ab90-9a72f54c95f2">
   One widely reported story, however, is by all accounts a fabrication.  Supposedly while playing for Seattle, Henderson went up to
   John Olerud
   , a former teammate then with the New York Mets, and asked why Olerud wore a batting helmet out on the field, noting that he "used to have a teammate in Toronto who did the same thing,"  to which Olerud replied, "That was me."
