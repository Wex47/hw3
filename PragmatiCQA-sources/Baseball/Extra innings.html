   Ordinarily, a baseball game consists of nine
   innings
   , each of which is divided into halves: the visiting team bats first, after which the home team takes its turn at bat. However, if the score remains tied at the end of nine complete innings, the rules provide that "play shall continue until (1) the visiting team has scored more total runs than the home team at the end of a completed inning; or (2) the home team scores the winning run in an uncompleted inning." Because they bat in the second (or "bottom") half of an inning, a home team which scores to take a lead either in the ninth inning or at any point in extra innings immediately ends the innning and the game with a win for that team.  Usually, the home team wins by only 1 run in this situation; but if the hit is a home run which leaves the playing field, all runners and the batter are entitled to score, with their runs counting in the final score even if it puts the home team ahead by more than 1 run. (Here, a grand slam with the score tied would put the home team ahead by 4 runs.)

   The rules of the game, including the batting order, availability of substitute players and pitchers, etc., remain intact in extra innings.
   Managers
   must display caution to avoid using all their substitute players, in case the game reaches extensive extra innings.
