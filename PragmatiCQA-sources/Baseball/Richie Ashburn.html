   Ashburn spent 12 of his 15 major-league seasons as the Phillies' center fielder (from
   1948
   through
   1959

Ashburn had the most hits (1,875) of any batter during the 1950s.  He also played in the most major league games during the 1950's (all with the Phillies).

To remedy matters, someone in the Mets organization taught Ashburn to say "Yo la tengo," Spanish for "I’ve got it." When Ashburn first used this phrase, it worked fine in keeping Chacón from running into him. But then left fielder

   In his last five seasons, Ashburn had played for the 8th-place Phillies, the 7th-place Cubs and the 10th place Mets. The infamous first-year Mets club only won a quarter of its games, and Ashburn decided to retire from active play. The last straw might have been during the Mets' 120th loss, when Ashburn was one of the three Mets victims in a
   triple play
   pulled off by his former teammates the 9th-place Cubs.
