   Batting is often cited as one of the most difficult feats in sports as it works down to hitting a small round ball with a thin round bat.  In fact, if a batter can get a hit in three out of ten
   at bats
   , giving him a
   batting average
   of .300, pronounced three-hundred, he is considered a good hitter.  In

   , an average of total bases with at-bats.  An OPS at or near 1.000 is considered to be the mark of an exceptional hitter.  A sustained OPS at or above 1.000 over a career is a feat only a few hitters have ever been able to reach.
