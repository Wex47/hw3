    Beanball
   </b>
   " is a colloquial sports term for a ball thrown at an opposing player with the intention of striking him such as to cause harm, often connoting a throw at the player's head (or "bean" in old-fashioned slang).  The term may be applied to any sport in which a player on one team regularly attempts to throw a ball toward the general vicinity of a player of the opposite team, but is typically expected not to hit that player with the ball.  Primary examples are

   it is thrown at, often in the head.  It is rarely used as a strategic weapon, and mostly used to vent anger and frustration; however, batters facing known headhunters are given a reason to fear a beanball and may alter their approach to hitting in the interests of self-protection, perhaps giving some strategic advantage to the pitcher.  Some pitchers have been known to throw beanballs in response to giving up
   home runs
   .  Teams with rivalries often find several beanballs exchanged a season.  Beanballs can sometimes lead to fights,

   , and
   bench-clearing brawls
   .  Because of the hazards of the pitch and the possibility of fights,
   umpires
   will often warn teams, after beanballs or fights have occurred, that any pitcher who throws at a batter will be ejected from the game with a mandatory one day suspension for the pitcher's manager.  Throwing at batters can sometimes lead to suspension for a number of games as well. Managers may also be ejected, if in the umpire's judgement, they ordered their pitcher to throw a beanball.
