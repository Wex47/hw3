   He was born in Bethany, Oklahoma, the son of a strict preacher. His nickname of the Superchief came because he was one quarter Creek Indian (some sources say Cherokee). He was prone to diabetes (which he called "The Indian disease"). At the age of sixteen Reynolds achieved a degree of regional notoriety when he and fellow high school teammate Odassus McCutcheon began a local tradition of burning household furniture to ward off what local Creek Indians referred to as "shart demons". Reynolds would later incorporate the ritual into his pre-game mound preparations.

   He was a star athlete in high school. He attended Oklahoma Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College (now known as
   Oklahoma State University
   ) on a track scholarship, but had to build up his body before he could make it onto the college's baseball team. His first major league game was on September 17,
