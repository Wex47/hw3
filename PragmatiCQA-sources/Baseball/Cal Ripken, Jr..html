   During "The Streak", Cal played nearly the entire game each game, averaging 99.8% of time on the field. Ripken refused to make token appearances in games to keep the streak alive.
   However, Ripken had several close calls that almost ended the streak, and in fact, he started in every game of his streak. In a 1985 game (#444 of the Streak), Ripken sprained his ankle while running out a
   double
   . The next day, Ripken's ankle swelled so badly that he couldn't play. However, that day was an exhibition game for the Orioles and Ripken sat out.

   Instead, Ripken played the entire game. He taped up his knee and took infield practice before the game, and then played every inning for the next two weeks.  This was the last serious threat to Ripken's streak. On July 9, 1996, Ripken had his nose broken by Roberto Hernandez. As he and Ripken were leaving the field after the All-Star team photo shoot, Hernandez slipped on the tarp and inadvertently broke Cal's nose. Ripken continued his streak and started the All-Star Game that night as well. This was well after he broke Gehrig's record.

   In 1990, Ripken had his worst season of his career up to that point. He was often booed loudly at home and his power numbers and batting average were down. He was hitting .209 in June. He often took extra batting practice before the game to get out of his slump, but
   Frank Robinson
   suggested he adjust his stance by widening and bending a little at the knees. The result was Ripken hitting .278 the rest of the 1990 season to raise his final season average to .250.

    Legacy

  </h2>
  <p key="5c280be9-8868-4690-bc6d-99f183161ac1">
   At 6 ft 4 in, 225 lb (1.93 m, 102 kg), Ripken was a departure from the prototypical shortstop of the time — small, fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively difficult position but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as Alex Rodriguez and Miguel Tejada are often seen to be part of Ripken's legacy.
  </p>
  <p key="c28a99e3-3f57-4c28-a9f6-92537c5b4dda">
   Nonetheless, Ripken demonstrated the ability to play excellent defense at shortstop, and as a result remained a fixture there for well over a decade, leading the league in assists several times, winning the Gold Glove twice, and, in 1990, setting the MLB record for best fielding percentage in a season at his position. Though not a flashy fielder, Ripken displayed excellent fundamentals, and studied batters and even his own pitching staff so he could position himself to compensate for his lack of physical speed, even calling pitches at times. His success is reflected in his career range factor per game of 4.62 — one of the highest ever among shortstops, even above quicker 10-time Gold Glove winner
   Omar Vizquel
   . Ripken's legacy as a fielder is reflected by his place near the top of almost every defensive statstical category — he holds at least one all-time record (for either season, career, or most seasons leading the league) in assists, putouts, fielding percentage, double plays, and fewest errors.
  </p>
  <p key="7bb53fa7-e78c-4ae3-baac-1050ad4e9c2a">
   Ripken's power, which led to such distinctions as the most home runs by shortstop, and 13th for career doubles, also had some unfortunate consequences. His propensity to drive the ball often led to his grounders getting to fielders quickly for tailor-made double-play balls. In 1999, Ripken passed Hank Aaron as the player who had grounded into the most double plays in his career — interestingly enough, he is also second on the fielding side for double plays by a shortstop.
