   Counsell is particularly known for his unusual batting stance, where he points the bat straight up into the air as high as he can and moves it back and forth in an erratic fashion. While batting, almost his entire back is pointed towards the pitcher, though his feet remain perpendicular with the pitcher's mound. Counsell is also one of very few Major Leaguers not to wear batting gloves. He is not known for hitting far with his stance but he can run fast.

   As of the 2009 season, Counsell has changed to a traditional batting stance.
