   Grove joined the Orioles in
   1920
   and embarked on an epic minor league career which saw him regarded by some as one of the best pitchers in baseball, even before he ever threw a pitch in the majors. Breaking into the team's pitching rotation at midseason, Grove posted a 12-2 record. Over the next four seasons, he posted marks of 25-10, 18-8, 27-10 and 27-6, leading the

  <p key="b3a0eef9-aa7f-45b4-ba41-f8bfeb964108">
   Grove remained in the minor leagues through
   1924
   because Dunn, who ran an independent operation with no major-league affiliation, refused several offers from the majors to acquire him. Finally, early in
   1925
   , Dunn agreed to sell Grove's rights to the

   He battled injuries as a rookie and posted only a 10-13 record, despite leading the league in strikeouts.  Grove then settled down in
   1926
   and won the first of a record nine

Grove led the league in wins, ERA (2.06), strikeouts (175), winning percentage, complete games and shutouts.  He was also chosen as league

(Red Ruffing defeated him by 2 strikeouts in 1932).  Dazzy Vance of the Brooklyn Dodgers led his first 7 full seasons (1922-1928) after making token appearances in 1915 and 1918.  Grove often pitched in relief in between starts, and actually pitched in relief in 5 consecutive games in 1933.

   At the time, the Red Sox were a bad team, and Grove didn't help much his first year, when an arm injury held him to an 8-8 record. However in
   1935
   , Grove returned to form with a 20-12 record and a league-leading 2.70 ERA.  Grove won his eighth ERA title a year later, and also led the league in that category and winning percentage in
   1939
   .  Grove did not win as many games in Boston as he did in Philadelphia, as managers he had some bouts of arm trouble.  Nevertheless, Grove continued to post outstanding records, including 14-4 in
   1938
   and 15-4 in
   1939
   .  Grove set still-standing major league records by leading the league 9 times in earned-run-average and 5 times in won-lost percentage, as well as 7 consecutive 20-win seasons by a lefthander.  His 8 20-win seasons are an AL record for a lefthanded pitcher (
   Eddie Plank
   had 7 20- win seasons in the AL and 1 in the Federal League (1915) and
   Warren Spahn
   had a total of 13 in the NL, but not more than 6 in a row.
