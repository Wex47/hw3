   Honus Wagner was born on February 24, 1874 to Bavarian immigrants Peter and Katheryn Wagner, in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania neighborhood of Mansfield (today known as Carnegie).  He was one of nine children, however only five lived past childhood.  As a child, he was called Hans by his mother, which would later evolve into Honus. "Hans" was also an alternate nickname during his major league career.  Wagner dropped out of school at age 12 to help his father and brothers in the coal mines.  In their free time, he and his brothers played sandlot baseball and developed their skills to such an extent that three of his brothers would go on to be professionals as well.  Wagner's older brother

   In the early phase of his career, Wagner played nearly every position, starting at third base, then seeing action in the outfield and first base, before his managers finally settled upon shortstop as his most valuable position. Defensively, he would scoop up grounders with his huge hands, often firing handfuls of gravel across the infield with his powerful throws.

   , all future Hall of Famers were notable "pupils" of Wagner. During this time, he wore uniform number 14, but later changed it to his more famous 33, which was later retired for him.  (His entire playing career was in the days before uniform numbers were worn.)  Wagner lived out the remainder of his life in Pittsburgh, where he was well known as a friendly figure around town.  He died on December 6,
   1955
   at the age of 81, and is buried at Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in the South Hills area of

   A life-size statue of Wagner, swinging the bat, atop a marble pedestal featuring admiring children, was forged by a local sculptor name Frank Vittor, and placed outside the left field corner gate at
   Forbes Field
   .  It was dedicated on

   , and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans.  The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them.  It now stands outside the main gate of
   PNC Park
   .  As that park is near the site of the Pirates' original home,
   Exposition Park
   , in a sense Wagner has come full circle.

   That very card was once owned by hockey great

   .  One theory for the card's scarcity is that Wagner, a non-smoker, requested the production of this card be halted since it was being sold as a marketing vehicle for  tobacco products.

   The problem with this theory is that Wagner appears on a tobacco piece produced by Recius in the late 1800s.  Another theory postulates that Wagner was not offered any compensation for the use of his likeness.  Consequently, he supposedly withdrew his permission to print any more copies.
