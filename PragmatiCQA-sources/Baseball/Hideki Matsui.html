However, when he started playing with his older brother and his friends, Matsui was such a good batter that his embarrassed brother insisted that he bat left-handed or stop playing with them. Matsui soon enough became an overpowering left-handed batter, and stayed on that side of the plate from then on. Matsui's stance is somewhat eccentric because he does not place any movement on his bat.

   .  Another factor was that Matsui's 16 home runs were disappointing in view of his 50 the year before in Japan. Some writers admitted they voted Berroa first because Matsui had previous experience in Japan. Also in his first game, Matsui did not understand what was happening when the Bleacher Creatures were chanting his name. He therefore did not acknowledge them and the chanting went on for almost two minutes.  (The fans in the Yankee Stadium bleachers are referred to as "Bleacher Creatures."  At the beginning of each Yankee home game, they do a "roll call" in which they rhythmically chant the name of each starting player, except the pitcher and catcher, until the player acknowledges the call.)
