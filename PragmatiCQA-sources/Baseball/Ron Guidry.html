He was even tougher with 2 outs and runners in scoring position (.152/.221/.253), and in the 9th inning of games (.119/.200/.136). Guidry's success during 1978 was due in large part to mastering the slider. He began throwing the pitch the year before, and was able to use the sharp-breaking slider to complement his great fastball throughout the season.

   However, Guidry was criticized in 2007, because the highly-acclaimed pitching staff was underachieving.
   The Yankees pitching staff in 2007 walked the sixth most batters overall in the Major leagues; this was the most walks in a season for a Yankees pitching staff since the 2000 season.  Torre's departure from the Yankees following the 2007 ended Guidry's tenure as pitching coach.  Though he was interested in returning to the Yankees for the 2008 season, he was not offered a position on new manager
   Joe Girardi's
   coaching staff.
   He did return to the Yankees as a spring training instructor.
