Damon was even quoted before his departure from the Red Sox as saying, "There's no way I can go play for the Yankees, but I know they're going to come after me hard.  It's definitely not the most important thing to go out there for the top dollar, which the Yankees are going to offer me. It's not what I need."
   In an October 1, 2005 interview with Damon's wife, Michelle, she stated, "I can't see him in a Yankees uniform....This could be his last contract, it could be his retirement, his future, his kids' future. But New York? No. Boston would really have to hurt his feelings."
   He joined the Yankees only months later.  As a result of this seeming indiscretion, a favorite T-shirt was seen in the Boston area which read "Looks like Jesus, throws like Mary, acts like Judas."

   During the first Yankee-Red Sox game of the 2006 season on May 1, Johnny Damon was cheered for his first plate appearance by some fans, whom he saluted (There were many more who booed him during that at bat, and when he took his position in center field, some fans threw fake money on the field).  After that plate appearance, he was booed by Fenway fans everywhere. He went 0-for-4. A minority of fans cheered Damon when he tipped his hat to his old team's dugout and then to the rest of the Fenway crowd.
   Reflecting on his return to Fenway, Damon remarked  "I love Boston and I always will.  I'll always have terrific memories and great fans here.  Those fans [that booed] are just the kind of people who wish they were in my spot -- they really do.  They've got no class, but that only speaks for a few of them. However, a few months later, he was quoted as saying in an interview, "Moving to New York was the best decision I ever made.  Now I'm in a place that actually wants me."  Damon may have been referring to the fans that booed him, or to the organization itself for not offering him more money, which he also said was of little importance to him months earlier.
