   One of the most controversial aspects of the player selection process is a rule that each team has to have at least one representative on its league's All-Star roster. While this rule made sense in baseball's pre-expansion days, when there were only eight teams in each league, many now consider it to be outdated since there are now almost twice as many Major League teams in existence. Opponents of the rule contend that the purpose of the game is to spotlight MLB's best players, and many superior players get left off the roster in favor of less deserving players from weaker teams. Supporters of the rule maintain that if the rule were dropped, a small number of powerful teams could end up dominating most of the available roster space. Also, supporters of the rule say that it gives fans from every team (even the poor teams) a reason to watch the game-the reason being that if the game were dominated only by players from a few top teams many fans wouldn't watch because they wouldn't have a favorite or familiar player to follow.

   A number of compromises have been suggested, such as limiting the number of representatives a particular team could have, or requiring that a certain percentage of teams be represented. However, Major League Baseball has not indicated that it is considering altering or eliminating the rule in any form.

   in
   Boston
   on
   July 31
   ,
   1961

   Following a highly controversial situation in the
   2002
   game when both teams ran out of pitchers in the 11th inning, and in response Commissioner
   Bud Selig
   declared the game over, Major League Baseball changed the rules to give the All-Star game "meaning" and additional incentive for victory. From the
   2003
   season up to the present, the league that won the All-Star Game was to be given home-field advantage for the
   <a href="World Series.html" key="f0152029-61d3-4a57-8c1b-8cdee1539ab0" title="World Series">
    World Series
   </a>
   (something Selig is considering ending, as the AL is unbeaten in every All-Star Game since 1997). Previously, home field advantage in the World Series alternated between the two leagues each year.
  </p>
  <p key="2b1dddc3-5ce4-43ca-a17a-7a7838152e4b">
   Even under the new rules, there is no guarantee that a repeat of the 2002 situation might not occur. The game could still be called a "suspended game" in which case it would become a tie if no make-up date was scheduled. It would be extremely difficult to find such a make-up date: Major League Baseball would have to postpone one or more days of the regular season and/or schedule the make-up date on the travel day between the regular season and the
   Division Series
   . Also, one team or the other could alternatively forfeit the game by refusing to continue (see: Major League Baseball's "Official Rules: 4.00 Starting and Ending a Game").
