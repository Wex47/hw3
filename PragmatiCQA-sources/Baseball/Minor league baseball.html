   Minor league baseball also goes by the nickname the "farm system," "farm club," or "farm team(s)," because of a joke passed around by major league players in the 1930s when St. Louis Cardinals general manager
   Branch Rickey
   formalized the system and teams in small towns were "growing players down on the farm like corn."

  <p key="b3da43dd-4428-4275-b8d6-19ae7801ab39">
   Baseball evolved in the mid-to-late 19th century from an amateur pastime into an organized professional sport.
  </p>
  <p key="472ecfba-971c-4487-9d17-5a96b0bf9d96">
   Fully and openly professional baseball teams arose in 1869.  The earliest professional association, the National Association of 1871 to 1875, comprised all fully professional teams.  This proved unworkable.  There was no way to ensure competitive balance, and financially unsound clubs often failed midseason.  This problem was solved in 1876 with the formation of the National League, with a limited membership which excluded less competitive and financially weaker teams.
  </p>
  <p key="536a1c93-a633-4c92-aa10-9e500ecaa237">
   Professional clubs outside the National League responded by forming regional associations of their own.  There was a series of ad hoc groupings such as the New England Association of 1877 and the Eastern Championship Association of 1881.  These were loose groups of independent clubs which agreed to play a series of games for a championship pennant.
  </p>
  <p key="13eb7985-a229-444b-ac67-a4c06a2aa885">
   The first minor league is traditionally considered to be the Northwest League of 1883 to 1884.  Unlike the earlier minor associations, it was conceived as a permanent organization.  It also, along with the National League and the American Association, was a party to the National Agreement of 1883.  Included in this was the agreement to respect the reserve lists of clubs in each league.  Teams in the National League and the American Association could only reserve players who had been paid at least $1000.  Northwest League teams could reserve players paid merely $750. This implicitly established the division into major and minor leagues.
  </p>
  <p key="edae1869-3318-4430-a16c-8401007ead93">
   Over the next two decades many more minor leagues signed various versions of the National Agreement.  Eventually the minor league joined together to negotiate jointly.

   They worried about the conflict spilling over into their operations. Representatives met at the Leland Hotel in
   Chicago
   on
   September 5
   ,
   1901
   . In response to the National-American battle, they agreed to form the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, called the NABPL, or "NA" for short. (The "NA" uses the name Minor League Baseball today.) Powers was made the first president of the NABPL, whose offices were established in Auburn, New York.
  </p>
  <p key="fb86cc2c-3d59-426d-86c6-c6cf1227d831">
   The purpose of the NA at the time was to maintain the independence of the leagues involved. Several did not sign the agreement, and continued to work independently.
  </p>
  <p key="042c8a38-5039-4852-96b5-4483e9391f73">
   In 1903 the dog fight between the American and National Leagues ended in the
   . The NABPL became involved in the later stages of the negotiations to develop rules for the acquisition of players from their leagues by the National and the American.
  </p>
  <p key="41736a36-b345-4710-9f50-b2df51d503c3">
   The NA was signed because players were being pilfered from clubs in other leagues with little or no compensation to the teams. The 1903 agreement ensured that teams would be compensated for the players that they had taken the time and effort to scout and develop.
  </p>
  <p key="5fb624c9-bf04-4d3a-a387-c03ee8534f82">
   No NA team was required to sell their players, although most did because the cash became an important source of revenue for most teams.
  </p>
  <p key="bb9758ef-f349-466a-84dd-66102ad9fe1f">
   These leagues were still fiercely independent, and the term "minor" was seldom used in reference to them, save by the major-market sports writers. News did not travel far in the days before heavy television and radio, so, while the leagues often bristled at the major market writers descriptions, their viewpoint of the situation in that day was that they were independent sports businesses, no more and no less.

   . The minor league players work at the lower end of major league pay scales and are covered by all rules and player agreements of the players association.  This allows the other 15 players to play every day rather than sit on the bench. Minor league players not on the 40 Man Roster are under contract to their parent major league baseball club but have no union. They generally work for far less pay, starting at Rookie to Triple-A (highest). Many players have signing bonuses and other additional compensation that can run into the millions of dollars, although that is far more rare.

   Even though minor league players are paid considerably less than their major league counterparts, they are still nevertheless paid for their services and are thus considered professional athletes.  Baseball cards refer to "pro record" and "pro seasons" as including both major and minor leagues.  For this reason, minor league players generally consider it an insult when someone asks when they're going to "get to the pros".

  <p key="29c8b667-e12e-4f9c-86c0-b604051c3c9e">
   Major league clubs in the modern farm system will enter into affiliation agreements with several teams to develop players at each class-level. Each major-league team has agreements with one AAA team, one AA team, at least two at A level (including Short-Season A), and at least one in a US-based Rookie League.
  </p>
  <p key="8b7055a8-8eb4-472a-bfc5-f9bb40c384cc">
   Class A ball used to be divided into High-A and A levels.  Minor League Baseball eliminated the distinction in 2002, but the system still develops players by moving them through the California, Carolina, and Florida State Leagues in the same way that has been done for decades. Twenty-one major league teams have a Short-Season A affiliate and a Rookie affiliate. Teams without a Short-Season A affiliate will invariably have at least two rookie franchises.  All clubs keep one Rookie team in a US system, like the Gulf Coast League or the Arizona League. Teams can have several additional Rookie League clubs, depending upon whether the teams participate in the rookie leagues in the Dominican Republic, Venezuela or Mexico. In some cases in the Dominican Summer League, teams may also split control of a rookie club.

Oftentimes referred to as a "parking lot" because many major-league quality players (especially if they had signed with some of the leagues' worst teams) are held in reserve at the minor league level for major league emergencies (since they would not have to clear waivers to be called up).

For those not in contention, it gives them an opportunity to evaluate their "next best" players for the next season under game conditions.

Many will jump to the major league from this level, as many of the top prospects are put here to play against each other, rather than against players with big-league experience often seen in "AAA." A small handful of players might be placed here to start, usually veterans from foreign leagues with more experience in professional baseball.

   Until
   1963
   , there were also Class B, C, and D leagues (and, for half a season, one E league). The Class B of that day would be equivalent to the Rookie level today. The other class designations disappeared because leagues of that level could not sustain operation during a large downturn in the financial fortunes of minor league baseball in the 1950s and 1960s caused by the rise of television broadcasts of major league sports across broad regions of the country.

   A major league team's Director of Player Development determines, in coordination with the coaches and managers who evaluate their talent, in

   The farm system is ever-changing: Evaluations of players are ongoing. The Director of Player Development and his managers will meet or teleconference regularly to discuss how players are performing at each level. In addition to personal achievement, injuries, and high levels of achievement by players in the classes above and below all steer a player's movement up and down in the class system.

   Players will play for the team to which they are assigned for the duration of that season unless they are "called up," promoted to a higher level; "sent down," demoted to a lower class team in the major league club's farm system; or "released" from the farm system entirely. A release from minor-league level used to spell the end of a minor league player's career.  In more modern times, with a more powerful
   independent baseball
   system, many players will "park" a career for a season or two in the independent leagues, which are scouted much more heavily. Many will get a second or third look from the major league scouts if they turn their career around in the indies.

     Rehabiliation (Rehab) Assignments
    </b>
    - Players on the Disabled List (DL) can be sent to the minor leagues for rehab work. Players are sent to minor league clubs by geography and facilities, not by class for these reassignments. Curt Schilling's recovery from an ankle injury in 2005 saw him rehab in Pawtucket, Rhode Island at the Triple-A
    Pawtucket Red Sox
    , very close to the home club in Boston.

     Minor League Free Agency
    </b>
    - Like major leaguers, minor league players also enjoy free agency. Their contracts expire after three years if they are on the 40 man roster, and unless their contracts are renewed by mutual agreement, they are released from any obligation to the major league club. Those who can't find the right deal with an affiliated baseball club may also take a season in independent baseball before returning to the farm system of another major league club. This is done because players, in the world of free agency and high-dollar salaries, often find their careers "stuck." Major league clubs will often trade for a big dollar position player rather than call someone up from the minor leagues. This can leave position players in the Triple-A and Double-A levels of the farm system with no ability to move up. They become 'spare parts' players unless they can find a new club that views their skills differently.

     Class System Variations
    </b>
    - The classification system today is a very rough rule of thumb, particularly in the "readiness" category. There are players who start at all levels of the farm system, although launching from Triple-A is the most rare. More and more players are taken from Class AA to the majors without time in Class AAA. Triple-A has two appropriate nicknames: It's been dubbed the "parking lot" by some sports writers because players can easily get trapped into being reserves for injured major leaguers. It's also been called the "third major league," because the level of play is exceptional, players play harder because they want to prove something to those judging their talent, and because they draw as well as, if not better than, some of their major league counterparts. The Marlins may have won the 2003 World Series, but up until playoff time, their Triple-A
    Albuquerque Isotopes
    franchise was outseating the major league club most nights of the week. The independent leagues also play a role, draining off some talent looking for a change, while some players, particularly foreigners, may elect to play in Japan or another country.
