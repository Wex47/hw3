   Selig's experiment was staggeringly successful - those nine games drew 264,297 fans.  In Chicago that season, the Sox drew 539,478 fans to their remaining 58 home games.  In just a handful of games, the Milwaukee crowds accounted for nearly

   In 1969, the Sox schedule in Milwaukee was expanded to include 11 home games (one against every other franchise in the American League at the time).  Although those games were attended by slightly fewer fans (198,211 fans, for an average of 18,019) they represented a greater percentage of the total White Sox attendance than the previous year - over one-third of the fans who went to Sox home games in 1969 did so at County Stadium (in the remaining 59 home dates in Chicago, the Sox drew 391,335 for an average of 6,632 per game).

   Selig was unable to gain a major league franchise for Milwaukee through expansion, so he purchased the Pale Hose from Allyn with the intention of moving them north to County Stadium.  But unwilling to concede Chicago to the National League, the American League vetoed the sale.  Not discouraged, Selig instead bought the struggling
   Seattle Pilots
   instead.  In the spring of 1970 Milwaukee had baseball again, and County Stadium had a new tenant.

   The new stadium funding plan proved to be extremely controversial, and it was not until 1996 that groundbreaking began on the new stadium, by now named
   Miller Park
   as part of a sponsorship deal with nearby Miller Brewing Company.  Miller Park's most distinctive new feature was a retractable roof, deemed essential to drawing fans during the cool and unpredictable Wisconsin spring.  At the time of the groundbreaking, Miller Park was scheduled to open in 2000, making 1999 the final season in County Stadium.
