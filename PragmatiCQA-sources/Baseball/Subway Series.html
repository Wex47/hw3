   Although organized games between all-stars from New York teams against all-stars from Brooklyn teams date back to the 1850s, the first actual New York - Brooklyn "World Championship Series" occurred in
   1889
   , a full nine years before Brooklyn was incorporated into the City of New York by the Greater New York Act of 1898, when the New York Giants squared off against the Brooklyn team of the American Association. Some might argue that the 1889 series would qualify as a "Trolley Series" (being the inspiration for the Dodgers' nickname), but would not qualify as a Subway Series at all, as the first section of New York's subway did not open until 1904.
  </p>
  <p key="54c1502c-a500-4c0d-b691-60c7040dc9b0">
   In the case of the World Series contests listed, the entire Series could be attended by using the subway. The date of the first usage of the term "Subway Series" is uncertain. The term "Nickel Series" (a nickel was the old subway fare) appeared in newspapers by 1927, and "Subway Series" appeared by 1928
   [1]
   . "Subway Series" was clearly already a familiar concept by 1934, as discussed in this article
   [2]
   about that year's All-Star Game to be held in New York, discussing the "subway series" possibility for the Giants and Yankees. (Ultimately, no New York team made it to the 1934 post-season.)

   In addition to the five World Series played between the Yankees and Giants prior to 1940, the two teams also played exhibition series against each other from time to time. The match-ups were known as the "City Series" and were sometimes played in October while other teams played in the World Series.  However, after 1940, this became difficult because the Yankees would routinely appear in the World Series.  In the seventeen year span 1941 through 1957 (after which the Giants and Dodgers left New York City for California), the Yankees appeared in the World Series twelve times, failing to reach the Series only in 1944, 1945, 1946, 1948 and 1954.

The annual charity event was discontinued following the 1957 season when the Yankees became the only major league team in the city, but it was revived in 1962 when the National League returned to New York with the expansion New York Mets.  After dwinding interest and public bickering between the owners of both teams, the Mayor's Trophy Game was discontinued in the late 1970s.

The 7 trains were blue and orange and featured the Mets version of the "NY" logo, and the 4 trains were white with blue pinstripes and featured the Yankees version of the "NY" logo. Also, after each game in the series the city offered free subway rides home for attendees of the game.  Yankee fans displayed signs that read "Yankees in 4 and not in 7", predicting that the Yankees would easily dispatch the Mets in a Series sweep as opposed to a difficult, full-length Series.  The signs had the 4 in a green cirle designating the number 4 train and the 7 in a purple circle designating the number 7 train.
