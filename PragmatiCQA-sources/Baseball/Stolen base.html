   The stolen base (or its attempt) is one of the more exciting plays in baseball.  It has a feeling of free-spiritedness and daring, as the runner forgoes the safer course of staying at his base until the batter hits the ball.  Successful base-stealing requires not just simple running speed, but also good base-running instincts, quickness, and split-second timing.

   1898

In addition, if the situation of the game is such that the steal is of little use (usually late innings with a large difference in score), and the catcher does not attempt to throw out the runner, the runner is not credited with a steal, and the base is attributed to

   A base-stealing runner must begin running as soon as the pitcher has committed himself to throwing a pitch to home plate, neither sooner nor later.  If he begins to run too soon, the pitcher may throw to a base rather than to home — in this case, the runner is

   by throwing to the base several times before pitching, in the hope of dissuading the runner from too big a lead-off.  This action can also result in the runner being tagged out in a pick-off.  Another popular strategy is for the runner to attempt a steal while the hitter is instructed to swing at the pitch if it is at all hittable.  This

   can give the runner a good head start to take an extra base on the hit.  But if the hitter fails to hit the ball, the hit-and-run becomes a pure steal attempt, and the runner may be thrown out. Another risk of the hit-and-run is that a caught line-drive could result in an easy double play.

   A second and lessor known technique is the "delayed" steal. This technique, famously practiced by Eddie Stanky of the Brooklyn Dodgers, is where the runner does not break immediately for second when the pitcher commits to the plate. Instead the runner takes two or three large shuffles off of the base when the pitchers goes to the plate. This keys the middle infielders and the catcher to let their guard down, as it appears the runner is not stealing, but only getting a good secondary lead in case the ball is hit. In reality the delayed stealer is closing distance with second base. When the ball crosses the plate the runner breaks for second base, and is essentially stealing the base on the middle infielders who have not covered second base. Addtionally, the catcher is not ready to come out of his crouch and cannot throw to second until an infielder gets there. The delayed steal is a deceptive technique that is sometimes executed by even slow runners and many times results in a catcher throwing into centerfield. The technique is rarely seen at the Major League level but is used effectively by multiple college programs.

   Second base
   is the base most often stolen, as it is farthest from home plate and thus a longer throw from the catcher is required to prevent it.  Third base is more difficult to steal, but this is still commonly done.  It is possible for a player to steal home base, but this requires great daring and aggressiveness as the ball will almost certainly arrive at home plate before the runner.

   was also renowned for the thrilling feat of stealing home.  In more recent decades, a pure steal of home is hardly ever attempted, although home base is still occasionally stolen during a "delayed double steal," in which a runner on first base attempts to steal second while the runner on third base breaks for home as soon as the catcher throws to second base.

   .  In baseball's earlier decades, a runner on second base could steal first base, perhaps with the intention of drawing a throw which might allow a runner on third to score.  But modern rules forbid going backwards on the basepaths once a base has been legally reached, so there is currently no legal way to steal first base.

   Base stealing is an important characteristic of a particular style of baseball, sometimes called "small ball."  A team playing with this style emphasizes doing little things (including as risky running plays like base-stealing) to advance runners and score runs, often relying on pitching and defense to keep games close.
