   in 1973, managers became more willing to replace starters in the late innings with a lead in order to forestall any late rallies by opponents. Through the 1960s, both leagues' annual
   saves
   leaders tended toward totals of 20–25 saves; few pitchers remained in the role more than two or three years, with significant exceptions such as
   Roy Face
   and
   knuckleballer
   Hoyt Wilhelm
   . But in the 1970s, in an era allowing for greater opportunities for
   closers
   than had previously been available, Fingers' excellence in relief allowed him to gradually increase his annual saves totals past 30. In 1980 he broke Wilhelm's record of 227 saves, and eventually finished with 341, a record that stood until

   passed it in 1992.

   Fingers is regarded as a pioneer of modern relief pitching, essentially defining the role of the closer for years to come. As had generally been true in baseball through the 1960s, Fingers was originally moved to the bullpen – and eventually to his role as a closer – due to struggles with starting. Before Fingers' time, a former starter's renewed success in the bullpen would have led back to a spot in the starting rotation; but since the successes of not only Fingers but also contemporaries such as
   Sparky Lyle
   and
   Goose Gossage
   , it has been widely accepted that an excellent pitcher might actually provide a greater benefit to his team as a closer than as a third or fourth starter. (Gossage, for example, was moved to the starting rotation after a first few seasons in relief — and he got clobbered despite pitching 17 complete games and was then moved back to the bullpen to stay.) As a result, later teams have been more willing to move successful starters — notably
   Dennis Eckersley
   ,

   role of closer, with no plans to bring them back to the rotation (although Smoltz bucked that trend by successfully returning to the rotation in
   2005
   ). In 2006,
   Bruce Sutter
   became the first pitcher in baseball history elected to the Hall of Fame who never started a game in his major league career.

   reported on

   2007
   that Fingers owes Wisconsin (in 2007) more than $1.4 million in income taxes and is the seventh biggest tax delinquent in the state.
   Fingers disputes the claim, saying he was shocked when he learned of it and that taxes were properly withheld from his Brewers paychecks.

  <p key="ae281a17-be0a-455f-b289-d7c6b102e86a">
   On August 15, 2007, the Associated Press reported that Fingers' name had been removed from Wisconsin's delinquent tax list the previous month.  "That's all been taken care of," he told the AP.  "I've had more people try to tell me, 'You know, you owe 1.4 million dollars.'  I said, 'No, I don't.'  We got all that squared away.  I had to go all the way back to 1981 on my income taxes.  That's all been taken care of, and I did pay my taxes back then, so there's no problem.  The revenue department's happy with me right now, so it's all been resolved."
