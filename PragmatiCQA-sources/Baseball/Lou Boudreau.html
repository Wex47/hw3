Boudreau still holds shares records for hitting the most consecutive doubles in a game (four) and most total doubles in a game, both done on July 14, 1946. He also shares the major league record with a few other players for 5 long hits (extra base hits) in one game) - 4 doubles and a home run on July 14, 1946. His 8 fielding titles (based on 100-game seasons) also gives him a share of the major league record.
