   Tejada developed quickly into a top-notch prospect, showing early signs of power. He reached the majors towards the end of the 1997 season, joining a struggling Oakland Athletics club. Though he only hit .202 in 26 games that year, the A's saw potential in the 21-year-old Tejada and gave him the starting shortstop job beginning in 1998. Miguel Tejada grew up idolizing the Baltimore Orioles SS
   Cal Ripken Jr

   The A's, and Tejada, steadily improved over the next two years. His hitting improved as he gained more discipline at the plate. In 1998, he hit .233 with 11
   home runs

   In 2001, Tejada had a comparable offensive year, hitting .267 with 31 homers, including hitting for the cycle on
   September 29
   . The A's captured the American League

   Tejada's breakout year came in 2002. With the departure of Jason Giambi to the New York Yankees during the offseason, and a leg injury to slugger
   Jermaine Dye
   , the A's lost two of their key offensive players. Tejada hit .308 with 34 homers and led the A's to their second Western Division title in three years. Tejada was named to his first All-Star team, had a 24-game hitting streak, and established his career high in runs scored.  The A's campaign included an American League record 20 game win-streak. Tejada contributed one-out, game-winning hits in the 18th and 19th games of that run: a three-run homer off

   The next year, both the A's and Tejada got off to a slow start, with the shortstop hitting under
   .200
   for the first month of the season. Improved play in the second half of the season led the A's to their second straight Western Division title and their third in four years. Tejada hit .278 with 27 homers for the year, a decrease from his numbers in 2002, but still leading many offensive categories for shortstops, earning himself a second consecutive All-Star appearance.

   By the end of the 2003 season, Tejada had established himself as one of baseball's premier shortstops. The  A's elected not to resign the free agent, citing budget concerns and a young

   As an Oriole, Tejada follows in the footsteps of legendary Baltimore shortstop
   Cal Ripken Jr.
   . Like Ripken, Tejada is a strong and durable shortstop with unusual power numbers for a middle infielder. Ripken currently holds baseball's record for consecutive games played at 2,632. Tejada played in his 1,000th
   consecutive game
   on July 1, 2006--then the seventh-longest streak of all-time.  In Game # 1151 on June 20, 2007 he broke his wrist when hit by a pitch.  The next day (June 21, 2007), he went up to bunt in the top half of the first inning, bunted into a force play, and was replaced by a pinch-runner.  Following the game, he was place on the disabled list, ending his streak at 1152 games, the fifth longest in majorleague history (topped only by Ripken-2632,

   Some say Miguel Tejada is the best offensive shortstop in Major League Baseball, a claim well supported by his statistics. Teammate

Tejada had claimed to have been born in 1976 when a Dominican birth certificate showed that he was born in 1974. That birth certificate also shows the spelling of his surname as "Tejeda" rather than "Tejada".
