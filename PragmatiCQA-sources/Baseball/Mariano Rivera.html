   Rivera grew up in Panama frequently playing baseball with his friends, substituting milk cartons for gloves and tree branches for bats.
   Although his father was a fisherman, Rivera never dreamed of taking up the profession, calling the job "way too tough." As a 19-year old, Mariano had to abandon a capsizing 120-ton commercial boat he had been aboard, all but convincing him to give the job up.

   In 1990, a 20 year-old Rivera, then a shortstop, volunteered to pitch for his Panamá Oeste team.  A scout for the New York Yankees, Herb Raybourn was in attendance at one of his games.  Although Rivera had no formal pitching training, he was throwing 85–87
   MPH
   with a smooth delivery, prompting Raybourn to sign Rivera to a contract with a $3,000 signing bonus.
   Rivera rewarded Raybourn's faith by posting

   At the beginning of September 2006, Rivera was sidelined with an elbow strain in his throwing arm.
   With the Yankees leading the Red Sox in the AL East divisional race by a large margin, the team decided to rest him for most of September.
   Rivera finished the 2006 season with 34 saves in 37 opportunities and an ERA of 1.80, the fourth consecutive season he posted a sub-2.00 ERA.
   Although he was well-rested for the postseason for the first time in years, the Yankees were unable to advance past the first round. He pitched just one inning against Detroit, in a non-save situation.

   and MLB.com's Closer of the Year Award for the 3rd consecutive season.

Rivera made headlines by responding if he did not receive an extension from the Yankees, he would pursue free agency.

   Despite a sparkling spring training, Rivera had an uncharacteristically bad month in April. He blew his first two save opportunities, compiled two losses, and gave up 9 earned runs in 7 2/3 innings.
   Rivera saved one game that month and his performance prompted writers to question whether something was wrong.
   Many attributed his struggles early in the year to infrequent use, as the Yankees presented him with few opportunities to enter a game.
   Rivera responded by saving 30 of his next 32 opportunities and posting a 2.22 ERA over the final five months of the season. Still, the 2007 regular season was Rivera's weakest statistical season as a closer, in many respects.  He gave up career highs in earned runs (25) and hits (68) as a closer, and his 3.15 ERA was his highest mark as a reliever.  His 30 saves in 34 opportunities were his second-lowest total as a closer.  He did, however, set a career best for K/9 as a closer (9.34) and he was fourth in the American League with 58 games finished.

   In the 2007 postseason, Rivera appeared in three games and pitched 4 2/3 scoreless innings, all in non-save situations. He lowered his all-time best postseason ERA to 0.77. Still, the Yankees failed to advance past the first round for the third consecutive year. The day after the Yankees were eliminated from the playoffs, Rivera stated that he intended to test the free agent market.
   Rivera eventually agreed to a 3-year, $45 million contract to remain a New York Yankee.
   This contract, averaging $15 million per year, will make him the highest paid reliever in baseball history.

His performance earned him the DHL Presents the Delivery Man of the Month Award for April. Rivera set a personal best by pitching 16 consecutive scoreless innings to start the season. On June 2, 2008, Rivera was named the American League Player of the Week for pitching five scoreless innings and converting three saves the previous week.

   article written by T.J. Quinn, however, claims that Rivera learned to throw his cutter from John Wetteland when Rivera was his set-up man in 1996.

   Although the subject is continuously debated, some people in the baseball world consider Rivera the best relief pitcher in postseason history
   and the greatest closer in baseball history.
   Buster Olney says "no other player can instill calm in his team's fans as reliably as Mariano Rivera, the game's dominant closer and arguably the best relief pitcher of all time."

   and consistency, performing well in the role in the 12 years he has maintained it. As a reliever, Rivera has finished the regular season with a sub-3.00 ERA in all but one season, and only once in his career has he pitched fewer than 60 innings in a season.
   His tenure as the Yankees' closer has exceeded the ordinary lifetime of a Major League closer, as only Trevor Hoffman has remained tenured as closer for the same team since 2002.
