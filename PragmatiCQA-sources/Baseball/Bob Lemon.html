   1948
   he won 20 games in the regular season and two more in the Fall Classic for the World Champion Indians, and in
   1954
   he was 23-7 as Cleveland won the pennant. He retired in 1958 with 207 wins, all but 10 of them won in a ten-year span.  Lemon was the first righthanded pitcher in the lively ballera (since 1920) to record 7 20-game seasons.  Ferguson Jenkins later tied him with 7, and Jim Palmer recorded 8 20-game victory seasons.

   Ironically, five days after the Martin-Lemon changeover, the Yankees divulged at their 1978 Old Timers' Day that Lemon would be moved in

The Yanks, who trailed by at least 14 (some sources say 14 and a half) games in July, pulled even with the Red Sox by defeating them in a four-game September series known as the Boston Massacre ever since. The Yankees pulled ahead by three and a half games, but the Red Sox rallied to tie the Yanks in the final day of the season.

   When the Yankees struggled in the first part of
   1979
   , Lemon, who some say was distracted by the death of his son in the off-season,  took the blame and was fired by  Steinbrenner, replaced by Martin. Amazingly, Lemon maintained a close relationship with Steinbrenner, and when the Yankees needed a boost late in
   1981
   , he was brought back to skipper the team. Lemon moved on to the post-season and dispatched the
   Milwaukee Brewers
   and the

   , and won the first two games of the World Series against the Dodgers, only to lose four straight. Lemon survived a few weeks into the
   1982
   season before Steinbrenner dismissed him one last time. He had managed just over one full season of games (172) for the Yankees, winning 99 for a .576 winning percentage.
