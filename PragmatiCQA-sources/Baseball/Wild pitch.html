   to field with ordinary effort, thereby allowing the batter and/or one or more
   baserunners
   to advance or to score. When (a) first base is unoccupied and/or (b) there are two outs, the catcher must catch the third strike in order to retire the batter; if a wild pitch occurs on such a third strike, the pitcher is credited with a strikeout, but the batter is not retired—he may attempt to advance to first base and must be tagged with the ball or forced at first in order to effect an out.

  <p key="7b1db2be-16ba-460c-9cbd-39c8678bb907">
   A wild pitch usually passes the catcher behind home plate, often allowing runners on base an easy chance to advance while the catcher chases the ball down.  Sometimes the catcher may block a pitch, and the ball may be nearby, but he simply cannot find it for one reason or another.

   A closely related statistic is the
   passed ball
   . As with many
   statistics
   , whether a pitch that gets away from a catcher is counted as a wild pitch or a passed ball is at the discretion of the
   official scorer
   .  The benefit of the doubt is given to the catcher if there is uncertainty; therefore, most of these situations are scored as wild pitches.

  <p key="cc7d375c-cece-4601-85bd-5027ef7a06a7">
   A wild pitch may only be scored if one or more runners advance a base.  If the bases are empty, or the catcher retrieves the ball quickly and the runner(s) are unable to move up, a wild pitch is not charged.  A runner who advances on a wild pitch is not credited with a

   Tony Mullane

   Mickey Welch

   Tim Keefe
