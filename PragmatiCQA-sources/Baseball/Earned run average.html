   would consistently post an ERA under 3.00 during those years. In the

   In modern baseball, an ERA under 2.00 is considered exceptional and is rare. An ERA between 2.00 and 3.00 is also considered excellent and is only achieved by the best pitchers in the league. An ERA between 3.00 and 4.00 is above-average. An ERA between 4.00 and 5.00 is average; the majority of pitchers have an ERA in this range. An ERA above 5.00 is generally considered below-average, and a pitcher with an ERA above 6.00 for a prolonged period of time is usually in danger of demotion to the
   bullpen
   or a lower league.

  <p key="41f056b3-c852-44ce-8a08-9e76a2a1536a">
   It can be misleading to judge relief pitchers solely on their ERAs, because a pitcher is responsible only for the runs scored by batters who reach base from him. If a relief pitcher enters the game with his team leading by one run, 2 outs in the inning, and the bases loaded, then gives up a single which scores two runs, he is not charged with those runs. If he retires the next batter, his ERA for that game would be 0.00 despite having surrendered the lead. In addition, relief pitchers know beforehand that they will only be pitching for a relatively short while, allowing them to throw each pitch with maximum energy, unlike starters, who need to keep something in reserve in case they are called upon to pitch 7 or more innings. This freedom to use their maximum energy for a few innings, or even for just a few batters, helps relievers keep their ERAs down.

   rule in the American League, pitchers spending all or most of their careers in the AL have been at a disadvantage in maintaining low ERAs compared to National League pitchers, who can often get an easy out facing the ninth batter (oddly, Martinez and Rivera, the ERA kings of the last decade or so, have been mostly active in the American League). This discrepancy between the leagues also affects relievers, but not to the same degree as they actually pitch to pitchers less than starters do for a number of reasons, chiefly because they are usually active in late innings when
   pinch hitters
   tend to be used in the ninth spot. ERA is also affected somewhat by the park in which a pitcher's team plays half its games as well as the tendencies of official scorers to assign errors or base hits in plays that could be either. For an extreme example, pitchers for the
   Colorado Rockies
   face a double problem. The high altitude of
