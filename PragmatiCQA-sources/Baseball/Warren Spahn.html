   . Although never quite as dominating as some, he was both astonishingly consistent and durable.  He won 20 games in 13 different seasons, and compiled a 23-7 record when he was aged 42.

   , and is acknowledged as one of the greatest left-handed pitchers in Major League Baseball history.  Spahn was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the BBWAA in 1973 in his first year of eligibility (His eligibility had been delayed, under the rules of the day, by 2 seasons of brief minor league service.)  He received a surprisingly low 83% of the Hall of Fame vote - in view of his achievements.  Several other pitchers have receover 90%.

  <p key="17d127f3-41b9-4220-a6e4-648a71abfc56">
   Spahn threw in the old windmill style, a big arm pump, swinging both hands behind his head, followed with an extremely high leg kick and a straight overhand delivery.   He threw a variety of pitches but his fastball was his best pitch as he could throw it with varying velocities and great control.
  </p>
  <p key="3ecac392-add1-4c94-9852-6bb59c96a659">
   His pickoff move was described as one of the best in the major leagues.  “The toughest pitcher of all for me to run against was Warren Spahn, a left hander.  But would have been just as tough going righthanded.  Spahn’s moves were so deceptive that I often found myself guessing."  -Maury Wills (How to Steal a Pennant, 1976).

   Warren Spahn was also an excellent hitter for a pitcher.  In 1958 he batted .333 with 2 HR and 15 RBI.  Spahn holds the NL record for most homeruns by a pitcher with 35.  He is second all time amongst pitchers in sacrifice flies with 14.

   , moving with the team from Boston to Milwaukee.  Spahn finished in the top five in Cy Young voting 5 times while winning it only once.  He was selected for the All-Star in 14 seasons.  He was not an overpowering pitcher for most of his career after knees problems took much of the velocity away from his fastball.  However he was one of the smartest pitchers in the league.  Whitlow Wyatt, the pitching coach for the Braves, said, "He makes my job easy. Every pitch he throws has an idea behind it."   He easily holds the record for most 20 win seasons in the live-ball era with 13.

   Warren Spahn made his major league debut in 1942 at 21 years old.  After being with the Braves a very short time, he clashed with manager
   <a href="Casey Stengel.html" key="86c1da08-0213-45ef-b434-d927a717fb02" title="Casey Stengel">

   , who sent him to the minors after Spahn refused to throw at a batter in an exhibition game. Stengel later said that it was the worst managing mistake he had ever made.   Spahn joined the military in 1943 and did not play baseball again until 1946.  There are many who believe that Spahn would have retired as the second winningest pitcher of all-time had it not been for the war.  Spahn himself was more skeptical stating:
  </p>
  <p key="f7ca0c0c-151e-4129-a5c3-52af5172b632">
   "People say that my absence from the big leagues may have cost me a chance to win 400 games. But I don't know about that. I matured a lot in three years, and I think I was better equipped to handle major league hitters at 25 than I was at 22. Also, I pitched until I was 44. Maybe I wouldn't have been able to do that otherwise."
  </p>
  <p key="fcd53023-d2e3-45ca-b05b-4fba7d8d8d1f">
   From 1947 to 1953 Spahn was one of the best pitchers in the League.  He consistently was the league lead in Wins, ERA, Strikeouts and Complete Games.  In
   1947
   he threw 7 shutouts, and repeated the feat in
   1951
   .  Spahn had established himself as the best lefthander pitcher in baseball.  Spahn pitched in the

   Duke Snider
   hit 19 against
   Robin Roberts
   .  “I blame myself for Willie.  If I had struck him out in ’51, maybe we could have gotten rid of him years ago.”   Spahn gave up the first career hit and homerun to Frank Ernaga (he would only have 11 more hits in his career).  Spahn also gave up the first career homerun of Sandy Koufax in 1962.
  </p>
  <p key="5c448221-0d35-44b6-b540-c6bfa58978bf">
   Knee problems in 1953 and 1954 hurt Spahn’s fastball.  But it did not change his effectiveness.  Instead he added a “screwball”, as he called it, in 1955.  But the grip he used for the pitch is the same as that used for the modern circle change.  (Season Ticket (1988)).   He also began throwing a slider in 1958, a palm ball and a knuckle ball in 1963.

   “Spahn became great because of these things and because he’s  one of the smartest men ever to play the game.  He came up with a screwball to help when his fast ball began to fade and then he added the slider…”  (Johnny Sain, Super Stars of Baseball, Bob Broeg 1971)

   Warren Spahn won more games from 1950-1959 than any other pitcher in the major leagues.  The Braves won the Pennant in
   1957
   and
   1958
   , winning the World Series in
   1957
   .  It is very difficult to pick Spahn’s best season, he averaged 20 wins per season, was in the top 5 in the league in ERA for six of the ten seasons and led the league in wins five out of ten seasons.

  <p key="24462b1e-3511-4034-a608-0afc63c3d510">
   On September 16, 1960, Spahn pitched the first no-hitter of his career against the Phillies, and the 4-0 win was his 20th of the season.  He was 39 years old.  The following year he threw another no-hitter, this time against the Giants on April 28, 1961 at 40 years old. Then, on August 11, he beat the Cubs in a packed Milwaukee County Stadium for his 300th career victory. Despite a poor won-loss record (for him) of 18-14 in 1962, Spahn still led the NL in complete games and had a 3.04 ERA, and in 1963, at the age of 42, he tied his career-best record with a 23-7 mark. It would prove to be his last great season.

  <p key="dab7d7c9-f098-432a-b0b6-0c7f70f32cbd">
   Even at his age, Spahn continued to pitch very effetively.  Stan Musial was quoted as saying, "I don't think Spahn will ever get into the Hall of Fame, He'll never stop pitching."

   On July 2,

    Juan Marichal

   . The score was still 0-0 after more than four hours when Willie Mays hit a game-winning solo home run off Spahn with one out in the bottom of the 16th inning. Marichal's manager,
   Alvin Dark
   , visited the mound in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 13th, and 14th innings, and was talked out of removing Marichal each time. During the 14th-inning visit, Marichal told Dark, "Do you see that man pitching for the other side? Do you know that man is 42 years old? I'm only 25. If that man is on the mound, nobody is going to take me out of here." Marichal ended up throwing 227 pitches in the complete game 1-0 win, while Spahn threw 201 in the loss, allowing nine hits and one walk.

  <p key="ecc54981-4c7e-40f5-98b3-27426c951f24">
   In 1964, as the league’s oldest player, Spahn’s age began to show.  He won a career low 6 games with a career high 5.29 ERA in 1964 and was demoted to the bullpen.  After the season he was sold to the Mets who would release him in July of 1965 after a 4-12 record.  The Giants signed him and Spahn went to the west coast, pitching his final major league games in a Giants uniform.  In his last major league game, he passed Bob Feller in career strikeouts.  Spahn played for Casey Stengel in his rookie year with the Boston Braves (4 games) in 1942 and in his the first half of his final season in 1965.  Spahn claimed that he played for Stengel "before and after Casey was a genius."
  </p>
  <p key="0fdf79ae-0a3e-465a-87b7-404afaff4b59">
   Spahn did not leave gracefully, grumbling, "I didn't quit; baseball retired me," and he pitched briefly in Mexico and in the minors until 1967 before finally retiring from the game.
