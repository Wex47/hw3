A pitcher getting a complete game shutout today usually entails one of the following circumstances: getting through the game while throwing an unusually low number of pitches; having one's own team score a large number of runs (allowing the pitcher a "run cushion" to complete the game without relief); or the team has a need that day to keep an unusually overworked bullpen rested if possible. An example of the rarity of the complete game shutout is with young pitcher
