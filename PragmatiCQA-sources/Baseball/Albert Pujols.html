   After appearing in the playoffs with the Cardinals in four of his first five years in the big leagues but falling short each time, Pujols won his first World Championship ring when the Cardinals won the
   2006 World Series
   , defeating the

   four games to one.  Pujols and starting pitcher Chris Carpenter were expected to carry the Cardinals if they had any chance to win. While Carpenter was a two game winner, Pujols hit only .200 in the Series (3 for 15), and the rest of the Cardinals team picked up the slack.

   Defensively, Pujols started his major league career as a third baseman.  It can also be noted that during Pujols' rookie season, he started at every position, except catcher and pitcher, during the course of the season.  When Scott Rolen joined the team in 2002, Pujols was moved to left field.  Following an injury scare in 2003, Pujols was moved to his current position, first base, which had been opened up by the retirement of Mark McGwire.  In 2005, John Dewan noted in The Fielding Bible that no first baseman was better at digging balls out of the dirt than Pujols.  Pujols saved 42 bad throws by his fielders in 2005.  Derrek Lee was second with 23. Pujols' fielding percentage was close to the bottom amongst qualified National League first basemen in his first two full seasons at the position, but in 2006 it was impressive.  After the season Pujols' improvements were recognized as he was given his first Gold Glove award. He has had the highest
   range factor
   amongst first basemen in his two full seasons, and lead the
   National League
   in that category in 2006; emblematic was the
   Pujols made to rob
   Placido Polanco
   of a hit in the 7th inning of
   Game 5 of the World Series
   .
