   The true statistical achievements of Negro League players are impossible to know, as the Negro Leagues did not compile complete statistics or game summaries.  As such, it is difficult to separate truth from myth in regards to Negro League stars such as Josh Gibson.  His

   plaque says he hit "almost 800" homers in his 17-year career, although the estimates range anywhere from 200 to more than 1000.  He is credited with several amazing years, slugging 69 home runs in 1934 and batting .467 with 55 home runs in 137 games in 1933. His lifetime batting average is said to be higher than .350, with other sources putting it as high as .384, the best in Negro League history. It was reported that he won nine home-run titles and four batting championships playing for the Crawfords and the

   Recent investigations into Negro League statistics, using box scores from newspapers from across the United States, has led to the estimate that, although as many as two thirds of Negro League team games were played against inferior competition (as traveling exhibition games), Josh Gibson still hit at least two hundred home runs in official Negro League games.  Though this number appears very conservative next to the statements of 800 to 1000 homeruns, this research also credits Gibson with a rate of one home-run every 15.9 at bats, which compares favorably with the rates of the top nine home-run hitters in Major League history.  Though these numbers are still based on incomplete evidence, this study does at least provide concrete proof that Josh Gibson was a power hitter of very high caliber.

   Despite the fact that statistical validation continues to prove difficult for Negro League players, the lack of verifiable figures has led to various amusing "Tall Tales" about immortals such as Gibson. A good example: In the last of the ninth at Pittsburgh, down a run, with a runner on base and two outs, Gibson hits one high and deep, so far into the twilight sky that it disappears from sight, apparently winning the game. The next day, the same two teams are playing again, now in Washington. Just as the teams have positioned themselves on the field, a ball comes falling out of the sky and a Washington outfielder grabs it. The
   umpire
   yells to Gibson, "You're out! In

   In early 1943, Josh Gibson fell into a coma and was diagnosed with a brain tumor.  He refused the option of surgical removal, and lived the next four years with recurring headaches.  Gibson died of a stroke in 1947, at age 35, in
