   player. His small stature and 150 pound (68 kg) weight made him one of the smallest players of the time. He is the brother of fellow Major Leaguer
   Paul Waner

   and quickly built the reputation of a slap hitter with an astute sense of plate discipline. In his rookie campaign, he batted .355 with 223 hits while only striking out 23 times (the highest strikeout total of his career).

   Waner played for the Pirates until the beginning of the
   1941
   season. In the preceding years he batted .300 or higher ten times, finished in the top ten in
   MVP voting
   twice (
   1927
   and
   1929
   ) and was an All-Star once (
   1938

   fan's pronunciation of "Big Person" and "Little Person." In
   1927
   , the season the brothers accumulated 460 hits, the fan is said to have remarked, "Them Waners! It's always the little poison on thoid (third) and the big poison on foist (first)!" But given that Lloyd was actually taller, this story is somewhat incongruous.

   has listed Waner as one of ten examples of Hall of Fame inductees who do not deserve the honor.
   Possible reasons for his (undeserved) selection include (1) his brother being a fellow inductee and (2) the inflated batting averages of his era, which also helped many other 1920's and 30's players in the eyes of the Hall of Fame
