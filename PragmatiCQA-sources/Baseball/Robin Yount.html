   Yount courted controversy in the winter of 1978. He threatened to retire from the game and take up professional golf rather than be underpaid by the Brewers. His demands were met during spring training in 1978, and he played the full season, ultimately becoming a Brewer for the rest of his career.  Rookie
   Paul Molitor
   filled in at shortstop during the first month of
