   , back in the American League. Many observers, keeping in mind that the aging Ryan had been pitching home games in the air-conditioned
   Astrodome
   , thought he would struggle by having to pitch outdoors in the oppressive Texas heat. Others predicted he would do well as American League batters hadn't faced "The Express" since 1979. With more run support than he had in 1987, Ryan had a number of fine seasons for the Rangers.

Ryan famously defended himself, perhaps better than any other known pitcher in a similar situation. The 46-year-old Ryan – a rancher in the offseason and highly dedicated to workouts during the season – promptly subdued the 26-year-old Ventura in a headlock with his left arm, pummelling Ventura's head with his right fist seven times before catcher

   . There are many similarities; both started in the majors at a very young age and struggled early in their careers, both were primarily "extreme fastball" pitchers noted for achieving previously unprecedented strikeout totals and multiple no-hitters, and both were very closed and private away from the game (though Koufax more so than Ryan). It was said of Ryan that he started every game with the intention of striking everyone out. Koufax once admitted that he began every game with the intention of throwing a perfect game, and failing that, a shutout. They were also both very conscious of their value, and had occasional contract disputes with their owners. An astute businessman, Ryan readily admitted that the money was a large part of the reason he played as long as he did. Ryan would also be remembered by many players and fans as a rough neck pitcher that did not take failure lightly. The numerous times he would try to beanball a player would be a unique part of his legacy. But this really defined him as a hard Texan who would take nothing from anybody.

  <p key="e5a7ff4d-a371-4847-ac0f-293dc49ebee3">
   But there are many differences too: Koufax pitched left-handed and Ryan right-handed; despite his early troubles, Koufax played his entire career with one team whereas Ryan played for several. Koufax was blessed to play on some championship Dodgers teams, whereas Ryan found himself on mostly mediocre teams. Most importantly, thanks to a strong arm that could handle a lot of work, Ryan had one of the longest careers of any player, whereas Koufax's sterling career was cut short in its prime by arthritis and arm trouble. Nonetheless, both stand out as the premier "power pitchers" of their time, if not all-time.
