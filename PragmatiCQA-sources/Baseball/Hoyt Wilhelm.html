   saved
   200 games in his career and the first pitcher to appear in 1000 games. He is also one of the oldest players to have pitched; his final appearance was 16 days short of his 50th birthday. (During his entire playing career, he was believed to be one year younger, but he straighted out the discrepancy late in life.)

   His success as a reliever helped the gradual change in usage patterns of pitchers, and the popularity of the concept of a "relief ace". Along with
   Phil Niekro
   , Wilhelm is considered by many as one of the greatest
   knuckleballers
   to have played the game, and he was elected to the
   <a class="mw-redirect" href="Baseball Hall of Fame.html" key="31fe5500-f3b8-40f7-aba3-c62791697391" title="Baseball Hall of Fame">

   The high point of Wilhelm’s career came at a time when his role as a pitcher was in flux. During his first six years in the majors, Wilhelm appeared in 361 games, all in relief. But in 1958, Cleveland manager
   Bobby Bragan
   used him occasionally as a starter, and Wilhelm continued in that dual role after a mid-season trade to Baltimore. On September 20, sporting a 2-10 won-lost record, he got his first start against the

   Although his accomplishments as a pitcher are well known, Wilhelm also holds an interesting record as a batter. On
   April 23

   1952
   , in his second game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm came to the plate for the first time in the majors. Facing rookie
