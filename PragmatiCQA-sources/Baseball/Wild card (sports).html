   The term
   <b key="3ef1e10c-3749-4d0c-b17a-caede5f444ef">
    wild card
   </b>
   refers broadly to a tournament or playoff berth awarded to an individual or team that has not qualified through normal play. In North American professional sports leagues, wild card refers to a team that qualifies for the championship playoffs without winning their specific subdivision (usually called a conference or division) outright. The number of wild card teams varies. In most cases, the rules of the league call for the wild card team to survive an extra round and/or to play the majority of their postseason games away from home.

   The term should not be confused with playoff formats that call for a set number of teams to qualify per division.  The American Football League's 1969 playoffs (qualifying the top two finishers from each league), the National Basketball Association's 1967-1970 playoffs (qualifying the top four finishers from each division), and the National Hockey League's 1968-1974 and 1982-1994 playoffs (qualifying the top four finishers from each division) should not be confused with wild-card playoff formats.  When a wild-card playoff format is used, the number of teams that may qualify per division is not fixed; the divisional champion will usually qualify automatically, but non-division finishers qualify based on record either in the league overall or within a conference.

   In the Division Series, the wild card team (which could be considered analogous to the fourth seed in other sports tournaments) usually plays the team with the best record within their league. However, an
   MLB rule
   states that teams from the same division are not allowed to face each other in the Division Series. Therefore, in the event that a wild-card team ends up sharing the same division as the team holding the best record, the former will play the second-best team in the league while the latter will face the third-best. This perfectly parallels the previous policy of the NFL after the NFL/AFL merger, when the league opted to include a wild-card team in each conference’s playoffs. (This policy thus ensured that the two best teams in a given conference, even if both of those teams were from the same division, could face off in the conference championship.)
