   . The cap on his plaque is an Expos cap, although he did ask if he could have the plaque as half an Expo and half a Met. Though most took this as Carter joking with the media at the time, it was a legitimate debate as to which team he would be associated with.

Additionally, Carter himself had expressed a preference to be inducted as a Met. However, Carter played 12 seasons in Montreal, as opposed to only five in New York. The final decision rested with the Hall of Fame, and the Hall felt that Carter's play with the Expos had earned his Hall of Fame induction, whereas his play with the Mets by itself would not have.
