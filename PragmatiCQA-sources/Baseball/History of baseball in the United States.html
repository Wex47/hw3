   , formulated the "Knickerbocker Rules", which in large part deal with organizational matters but which also lay out rules for playing the game.  One of the significant rules was the prohibition of "soaking" or "plugging" the runner; under older rules, a fielder could put a runner out by hitting the runner with the thrown ball.  The Knickerbocker Rules required fielders to tag or force the runner, as is done today, and avoided a lot of the arguments and fistfights that resulted from the earlier practice.

   The professional
   National League
   of Professional Base Ball Clubs, which is still existent, was established in 1875 after the National Association proved ineffective.  The emphasis was now on "clubs" rather than "players".  Clubs now had the ability to enforce player contracts, preventing players from jumping to higher-paying clubs.  Clubs in turn were required to play their full schedule of games, rather than forfeiting games scheduled once out of the running for the league championship, as happened frequently under the National Association.  A concerted effort was made to reduce the amount of gambling on games which was leaving the validity of results in doubt.

   Moses Fleetwood Walker
   and his brother Welday Walker were unceremoniously dropped from major and minor-league rosters in the 1880s, as were other African-Americans in baseball. An unknown number of African-Americans played in the major leagues as Indians, or South or Central Americans. And a still larger number played in the minor leagues and on amateur teams as well. In the majors, however, it was not until Robinson (in the National League) and

   The early years of the National League were nonetheless tumultuous, with threats from rival leagues and a rebellion by players against the hated "reserve clause", which restricted the free movement of players between clubs.  Competitive leagues formed regularly, and also disbanded regularly.  The most successful was the American Association (

Both leagues are considered major leagues by many baseball researchers because of the perceived high caliber of play (for a brief time anyway) and the number of star players featured. However, some researchers have disputed the major league status of the Union Association. Franchises came and went, and that the St. Louis club, which was deliberately "stacked" by the league's president (who owned that club), was the only club that was anywhere close to major league caliber.

   There were dozens of leagues, large and small, at this time. So what made the National League major?  Control of the major cities, particularly New York City, the edgy, emotional nerve center of baseball with several clubs.  They had both the biggest national media distribution systems of the day, and the populations that could generate big enough revenues for teams to hire the best players in the country.

   To call these leagues "minor" in these days would have been a poorly received mistake.  The term 'minor' league did not come into vogue until the Great Depression and St. Louis Cardinals GM
   Branch Rickey
   's coordinated developmental program, the farm system, came into being in the 1930s.  Still, these leagues needed money, and selling players to the more affluent National and American leagues sent them down the road that would strip the "in" from their independent status.

    Lastly, it established a system of control and dominance for the major leagues over the independents.  There would not be another Ban Johnson-like rebellion from the ranks of leagues with smaller cities.  Selling player contracts was rapidly becoming a staple business of the independent leagues.  During the rough and tumble years of the American-National struggle, player contracts were violated at the independents as well: Players that the team had developed would sign deals with the National or American leagues without any form of compensation to the indy club.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p key="c0bfceb5-26a8-4a4c-ad12-f4d20773e56e">
   The new agreement tied independent contracts to the reserve-clause national league contracts. Baseball players were a commodity, like cars. $5,000 bought your arm or your bat, and if you didn't like it, find someplace that would hire you. It set up a rough classification system for independent leagues that regulated the dollar value of contracts, the forerunner of the system refined by Rickey and used today.
  </p>
  <p key="add5ffd4-c4ac-4dd4-bd4f-9e573cb70497">
   It also gave the NA great power.  Many independents walked away from the 1901 meeting.  The deal with the NA punished those other indies who had not joined the NA and submitted to the will of the 'majors.'  The NA also agreed to the deal to prevent more pilfering of players with little or no compensation for the players' development.  Several leagues, seeing the writing on the wall, eventually joined the NA, which grew in size over the next several years.

   as of 2005; club owners were therefore reluctant to spend much money on new balls if not necessary.  It was not unusual for a single baseball to last an entire game.  By the end of the game, the ball would be dark with grass, mud, and tobacco juice, and it would be misshapen and lumpy from contact with the bat.  Balls were only replaced if they were hit into the crowd and lost, and many clubs employed security guards expressly for the purpose of retrieving balls hit into the stands—a practice unthinkable today.

   .  Nineteen-year-old rookie first baseman
   Fred Merkle
   , later to become one of the best players at his position in the league, was on first base, with teammate Moose McCormick on third with two out and the game tied.  Giants shortstop Al Bridwell socked a single, scoring McCormick and apparently winning the game.  However, Merkle, instead of advancing to second base, ran toward the clubhouse to avoid the spectators mobbing the field, which at that time was a common, acceptable practice.  The Cubs' second baseman,
   Johnny Evers
   , noticed this.  In the confusion that followed, Evers claimed to have retrieved the ball and touched second base, forcing Merkle out and nullifying the run scored.  The league ordered the game replayed at the end of the season, if necessary.  It turned out that the Cubs and Giants ended the season tied for first place, so the game was indeed replayed, and the Cubs won the game, the pennant, and subsequently the

   For his part, Merkle was doomed to endless criticism and vilification throughout his career for this lapse.  In his defense, some baseball historians have suggested that it was not customary for game-ending hits to be fully "run out", and it was only Evers's insistence on following the rules strictly that resulted in this unusual play.
   In fact, earlier in the 1908 season, the identical situation had been brought to the umpires' attention by Evers.  While the winning run was allowed to stand on that occasion, the dispute raised the umpires' awareness of the rule, and directly set up the Merkle controversy.

Dubbed 'peanut' by a batter because of her diminutive stature, there was little else small about this right-handed pitcher for the Indianapolis Clowns from 1953 to 1955, whose career record was 33-8 as a pitcher who also possessed a batting average that ranged .262 to .284, against some of the toughest male players of the day of any color.  The legendary Satchel Paige, whose Monarchs played the Clowns frequently, befriended Johnson and taught her a wicked curve ball.  She was one of a handful of women ever to play with men in the men's game. She did it with great success.

   and played to the crowd, and phenomenal players who made next-to-nothing and played with a power, passion, and intensity that was second to none. All of these fine black athletes would not let the dream die. They would prove that they were the best at what they did. They would survive and thrive in spite of white baseball's ban on them for the color of their skin. In the few instances of games played between major white and major black teams, the black teams usually won. One such game was worth a dozen Negro World Series to show that they could be the best at their sport.

  <p key="5c2028d2-477b-4888-bb38-26a7affd5574">
   Black teams combined the best of great baseball, church, Vaudeville and the side-show to pay the bills and keep playing. Teams scraped by on very little. A few, like the Kansas City Monarchs, the equivalent of the Yankees in the Negro National League, did very well. Some stayed afloat barely from game to game.  To cover the cost of traveling great distances, some teams would have to barnstorm, picking up games with semi-pro teams, company leagues, amateurs and even prison teams to make enough food and gas money to get to the next scheduled game.
  </p>
  <p key="3dcea32d-7d71-4df6-a129-6d031fb5b549">
   The road was hard for black baseball players.  Many towns had whites-only hotels and restaurants.  Players slept in the homes of fans on good days, on the bus, in a barn, or the booth of a tonk or bar on not-so-good ones, and out in open fields on bad ones.  Sometimes they had to keep moving rather than stop for a meal, where none could be found.  Usually though, once a team had established its "route," it also established a network of resources that would keep it running on the road that it would use in following years.
  </p>
  <p key="3956afb6-30b5-4381-95b6-1249c9da99a3">
   Teams from the different Negro leagues learned that they played for cash in those transit stops, and for keeps in games with other black clubs.  It would not be uncommon for a great black ballclub to lose a game to much inferior semi-pro or town team to keep the peace. Black athletes had far more to consider every time they took the plate, or appeared in public, than did their white contemporaries.
  </p>
  <p key="0d2f3fc7-6fdd-4ccc-9478-409f1e3b71bd">
   With all of the hardships, though, the games in black baseball were just more fun. Satchel Paige would taunt batters by telling them to pick where on the plate they wanted him to throw it. He would drop it right where they liked it, but they still couldn't touch it.  He had numerous names for his pitches, including the famed "Bee Ball," so-named because it could "...be where I want it to be."  Pitchers would invoke the crowd into chants and taunts.  One story without attribution recounts the tale of a batter who used to seat well-dressed, great looking women behind home plate to distract a particularly tough pitcher. Truth or myth, it is a fair representation of the colorful nature of the game.
  </p>
  <p key="794dc110-3829-47cb-bb6c-a6abec9e61a6">
   Negro league ball has also been characterized as being much quicker in pace. This was largely due to their schedules, which often had them playing over greater distances traveling by car or bus between daily games without breaks, or up to three games in a single day.

  <p key="292287fd-4e80-47a1-997c-f0dede57dfe5">
   Some of the increased offensive output can be explained by the
   1920
   rule change outlawing tampering with the ball, which pitchers had often done to produce "spitballs", "shine balls" and other trick pitches which had 'unnatural' flight through the air.  Umpires were also required to put new balls into play whenever the current ball became scuffed or discolored. This rule change was enforced all the more stringently following the death of
   Ray Chapman

   , 1920 (he died the next day). Discolored balls, harder for batters to see and therefore harder for batters to dodge, have been rigorously removed from play ever since.  There are two side effects. One, of course, is that if the batter can see the ball more easily, the batter can hit the ball more easily. The second is that without scuffs and other damage, pitchers are limited in their ability to control spin and so to cause altered trajectories.

  <p key="c2a63544-013b-4879-9bd7-3ad240bb4577">
   Still, in the past, rule changes favoring the batter had led to batting average increases, but not to widespread changes in hitting styles.  The "inside game" might have continued to dominate but for the activities of one remarkable player.  At the end of the 1919 season Harry Frazee, then owner of the

   Ruth's career mirrors the shift in dominance from pitching to hitting at this time.  He started his career as a pitcher in 1914, and by 1916 was considered one of the dominant left-handed pitchers in the game.  When Edward Barrow, managing the Red Sox, converted him to an outfielder, ballplayers and sportswriters were shocked.  It was apparent, however, that Ruth's bat in the lineup every day was far more valuable than Ruth's arm on the mound every fourth day.  Ruth swatted an unprecedented 29 home runs in his last season in Boston.  The next year, as a Yankee, he would hit 54 and in
   1921
   he hit 59. His
   1927
   mark of 60 home runs would last until
   1961

   In 1958 the New York market ripped apart.  The Yankees were becoming the dominant draw, and the cities of the West offered generations of new fans in much more sheltered markets for the other venerable New York clubs, the
   Brooklyn Dodgers
   and the
   New York Giants
   . Placing these storied, powerhouse clubs in the two biggest cities in the West had the specific design of crushing any attempt by the PCL to form a third major league. Eager to bring these big names to the West, Los Angeles gave Walter O'Malley, owner of the Dodgers, a helicopter tour of the city and asked him to pick his spot.  The Giants were given the lease to the PCL

   From the 1980s onward, the major league game has changed dramatically from a combination of effects brought about by free agency, improvements in the science of sports conditioning, changes in the marketing and television broadcasting of sporting events, and the push by brand-name products for greater visibility.  These events lead to greater labor difficulties, fan disaffection, skyrocketing prices, changes in the way that the game is played, and problems with the use of performance enhancing substances like

That year total attendance hit  70 million, but baseball was hit hard by a strike in 1994, and as of 2005 it has only marginally improved on those 1993 records.

   Another major change that had been occurring during this time was the adoption of the
   pitch count
   . Starting pitchers playing complete games had not been an unusual thing in baseball's history. Now pitching coaches watched to see how many pitches a player had thrown over the game. At anywhere from 125 to 175, pitchers increasingly would be pulled out to preserve their arms.  Bullpens began to specialize more, with more pitchers being trained as middle relievers, and a few hurlers, usually possessing high velocity but not much durability, as closers.

  <p key="8da66e58-0b45-42aa-b6eb-2c2fd057a3c9">
   Along with the expansion of teams, the addition of more pitchers needed to play a complete game stressed the total number of quality players available in a system that restricted its talent searches at that time to America, Canada, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

   Sky high salaries also changed many of the strategies of the game.  Players rarely were "sent" down to the minors if they failed to perform. Who could justify paying a slumping player millions to sit in Toledo where the major league fans couldn't pay their way?  Other players in the Triple-A level of the minor leagues, who used to rise on merit, became trapped under these overpaid "stars."  Worse still, in order to make the media happy, trades, rather than call-ups, became the order of the day.  It was much better to buy someone else's shortstop that was a known quantity to the national sports media than to take a chance on a player with no name value and no visibility if you were in a major market ballclub.
  </p>
  <p key="8822bf3e-4633-497a-be89-d28c07059dd3">
   Tactics on the field changed too.  Risky moves that could get players hurt, and sideline millions of dollars in payroll on the disabled list, became less common.  Stealing home, a popular tactic of great stars of the day like Ty Cobb or Pete Rose, became infrequent occurrences.
  </p>
  <p key="4781e1f7-8713-4b87-a6c5-bba7b97f22b9">
   The perception of players by the general public changed from larger-than-life heroes to a more cynical view of many of them as spoiled and overpaid.  This was fed by the growing legions of television reporters, commentators, and print sports writers who also started asking questions about what justified the kind of money being paid to these players.
  </p>
  <p key="c446def8-1c45-4eb0-aa57-a937a7122443">
   Free agency added gasoline to that fire as well. With players seeking greener pastures when their contracts came up, fewer players became career members of one ballclub.  In the modern era, it is almost unusual to see a player stay with any one club for more than a few years if they are good enough to command a better salary.
  </p>
  <p key="9c50ed9d-2b58-47d1-adfd-d29286acfc17">
   Players with any ability increasingly gravitated towards the money. Large market clubs like the New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, and the Chicago Cubs given big revenues from their cable television operations signed more and more of the big name players away from mid-sized and smaller market baseball clubs that could not afford to compete with them for salaries.

   All was not well with the game. The many contractual disputes between players and owners came to a head in 1981.    Previous players' strikes (in 1972, '73 and 80) had been held in preseason, with only the '72 stoppage — over benefits — causing disruption to the regular season.  Also, in 1976 the owners had locked the players out of spring training in a dispute over free agency.

  <p key="70696eee-8446-4cbb-bf01-5a1eca0e08c5">
   The crux of the 1981 dispute was about compensation for the loss of players to free agency.  After losing a top-rank player in such a way the owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called

By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct half, with the playoffs reorganised to reflect this.

   Labor relations were still strained.  There had been a two day strike in 1985 (over the division of television revenue money), and a 32-day spring training lockout in 1990 (again over salary structure and benefits).  By far the worst action would come in 1994.  The seeds were sown earlier: in 1992 the owners sought to renegotiate on salary and free-agency terms, but little progress was made.  The standoff continued until the beginning of 1994 when the existing agreement expired, with no agreement on what was to replace it.  Adding to the problems was the perception that "small market" teams, such as the struggling

   could not compete with high spending teams such as those in New York or Los Angeles.  Their plan was to institute TV revenue sharing to increase equity amongst the teams and impose a salary cap to keep expenditure down.  Players, naturally, felt that such a cap would reduce their potential earnings.

   . This revelation lead to a vast criminal investigation into BALCO's connections with athletes from baseball and many other sports.
   During grand jury testimony in December 2003 – which was illegally leaked to the San Francisco Chronicle and published in December 2004 – Giambi allegedly admitted to using many different steroids, including fertility drugs (which could account for his declining health in the past few years).  Bonds said that Anderson gave him a rubbing balm and a liquid substance which others speculated as being "the cream" and "the clear." The paper reported that these substances were probably designer steroids. Bonds said that at the time he did not believe them to be steroids.

   Various baseball pundits, fans, and even players have taken this as confirmation that Bonds uses illegal steroids. However, Bonds has never failed a drug test, despite being tested by Major League Baseball in 2003, 2004 and 2005, which may be attributable to cessation of using the chemical enhancements by that time, or successful obfuscation of continued use as documented in the 2006 book

   While the introduction of steroids certainly increased the power production of greats such as Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, and Barry Bonds, there were other factors that drastically increased the power surge after 1994.  The factors cited are: smaller sized ballparks than in the past, "juiced baseballs" implying that the balls are wound tighter thus travel further following contact with the bat, "watered down pitching" implying that lesser quality pitchers are up in the Major Leagues due to too many teams.

   had high on-base percentages, but were undervalued due to their low batting averages. The 'Moneyball Minsdet' revolutionized player evaluation, as the entire league soon embraced analytics such as

   over traditional metrics like the pitcher win. The introduction of Statcast's player tracking in 2015 allowed for even more in-depth analytics, such as sprint speed, barrel %, and spin rates on pitches.

   Offensive steadily declined from 2008 to 2014, where the league's scoring output of 4.07 runs per game was the lowest since 1981. To combat this, the MLB is widely believed to have introduced a 'juiced ball' following the 2015 All Star Break. The newer ball was more compact and thus traveled further, This, combined with a new analytics-driven approach to hitting that emphasized launch angle and hitting home runs, led to a drastic rise in the league's home run rate. Besides the 2000 season, the years of 2016-2021 represents the six highest single season home run rates in baseball history, topping out at 1.39 home runs per game in 2019. Alongside this increase in home run rate came a corresponding increase in strikeout rate. Between 2008 and 2019, MLB set the record for strikeout rate in every season. The reasons for this come primarily due to philosophical changes in both hitting and pitching. The increasing reliance on analytics in hitting meant an increased emphasis on slugging, often at the detriment of making contact. In spite of a fairly neutral run scoring environment, the 2021 season had the fourth lowest league batting average since the dead ball era, at .244. At the same time, pitcher velocity has increased dramatically, due to better conditioning, shorter outings for starters, and the corresponding reliance on relief pitching. Whereas a pitcher was once expected to pitch a complete game and pace himself, starting pitchers averaged just over five innings per start in 2021, the lowest ever. On September 24, 2010, Aroldis Chapman set the record for the fastest pitch in MLB history, at 105.1 MPH.

   In June of 2021, the MLB introduced foreign substance checks on pitchers after each inning due to reporting of widespread doctoring of baseballs. While many pitchers claimed to use substance primarily to gain a better grip, some used products like Spider Tack to increase their spin rate. On June 29, Héctor Santiago became the first pitcher to face suspension.
