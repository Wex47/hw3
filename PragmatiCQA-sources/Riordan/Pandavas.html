   Kunti

He was found by Radha, the wife of a kind charioteer named Adhiratha Nandana, and was named Vasushena but would later be known as Karna.

   Kunti met and chose her husband, King Pandu of Hastinapur, at a swayamvara organized by her cousin. Pandu also married a second woman named Madri
   from the Madra Kingdom. However, he got cursed to die when he slept with a woman by another sage named Kindama for shooting him as a
   deer
   while he was performing his copulation. Kunti found him upset that he couldn't have children because of this and took pity on him. So she used her boon to invoke
   Dharma Raja
   ,
   Vayu
   , and
   Indra
   . This resulted in Yudhistira, Bhima, and Arjuna being born. Nakula and Sahadeva were born to Queen Madri, from the

   appeared saying if he revealed the future to anyone then his head explode, Sahadeva agreed not to on the condition that Krishna befriends them. Madri, feeling guilty for causing Pandu's death, jumped into the cremating fire and died.

   Arjuna was a devoted student learning under a guru named Drona ("Dron-ah"), and Arjuna was passionate about his archery skills. He once witnessed Ekalavya ("eh-KUH-lav-yah"), the son of a tribal chief, make an impossible shot. This made him very jealous and scared that he wouldn't be the best archer anymore like Drona promised. The nervous guru took notice and Ekalavya asked him to be his student, but Drona refused due to his lower status. Ekalavya meditated on Drona anyway and even built a statue of him out of mud. So Drona demanded

   </i>
   , a way of honoring a teacher, and Ekalavya agreed to give him his right thumb so no one would be better than Arjuna.
   One day, when Drona assembled the Pandavas for a session, he tied a wooden fish to a tree branch. He instructed the brothers to shoot an arrow at the fish's eye, but they must look in the reflection of a pond. Dronacharya asked Yudhistira what he saw, he responded "The sky, the tree, the fish," but the teacher told him not to shoot. Bhima said "The branch of the tree, the fish," but he was asked not to shoot too. Arjuna said "The eye of the fish," only he was allowed to shoot.
   This act was later redone in a competition to win the heart of
   Draupadi
   , which demonstrated the archery prowess of Arjuna, the wooden fish was tied to a moving wheel on the ceiling instead. Arjuna was the only one who was able to succeed. But the virtuous and beautiful princess married all five brothers. She spent a year as the wife of each, it was a rule among the five brothers that you couldn’t barge in on Draupadi's privacy when she was with her husband-of-the-year.

   On the advice of Lord Krishna, the Pandavas burned down the Khandava ("KHAN-duh-vuh") Forest for
   Agni
   , the god of fire, to consume. All the inhabitants were killed except a snake named
   Takshaka
   who fled,
   and an
   asura
   named Mayasura who agreed to build the Pandava brothers the most beautiful palace the world had ever seen. It came with illusions that befuddled the mind and heightened the senses, it was extremely convincing. This palace was named Maya-Mahal,
   Palace of Illusions
   , and became sentient.
   Yudhistira liked to read but had trouble choosing a room, so the palace made sure his bed could float anywhere and books could be brought to him. Nakula liked to admire himself, so it made sure there were plenty of places where he might catch glimpses of his beauty. Sahadeva liked the sciences, so the palace made sure there was always an abundance of living things to study. Bhima liked to test his strength, so it made sure he had challenging arenas. Arjuna liked a little of everything, so it made sure nothing escaped his interest. Draupadi wanted peace most of all, but the closest the palace could muster was light.

   One day, Arjuna was called to fight off a bunch of demons. He had to answer the call, because that’s what heroes do. The only problem was, he’d left his special bow and arrow in the dining room where Princess Draupadi was eating with one of his brothers. The penalty for barging in on their privacy was exile. Rather than let innocent people get hurt by demons, Arjuna chose to break the rule, he had to go into the forest for twelve years.

  <p key="72f9dba6-7614-4f02-8192-a61aa98dff02">
   Draupadi had realized what had happened and did not want Arjuna to be exiled, but being a honorable warrior, Arjuna agreed to keep his word.
   During these years of exile, he was pulled inside a riverbank where he was performing his rituals. He met
   Uloopi
   , one of the serpent queens, who was responsible for this because she thought he was cute. After offering his rites to the fire in the
   Naga Realm
   , Uloopi confesses her love to him and  tells him that she will not live anymore if Arjuna does not marry her. Agreeing to Uloopi's wishes, Arjuna and Uloopi marry and have a son named Iravan. Pleased by Arjuna, Uloopi gifted him with being invincible underwater and communication with all sea creatures, but he had to go back and fight.

He fell through a floor tile that was actually water, and he nearly broke his foot jumping into a pool that turned out to be cleverly polished sapphires. On seeing the crown prince of Hastinapura fall into the pool, the Pandavas laughed. Insulted and jealous of the Pandavas' wealth, he had his uncle,
   Shakhuni

   One day while in the exile, Bhima went out to search for a flower for Draupadi. He encountered his half-brother,
   Hanuman

   Kubera

   rakshasas
   , including his friend, Maniman, but managed to fight them off. Then he swam in the pond of the garden . Draupadi got worried that Bhima was gone so long, so she, the other Pandavas went off looking for him. When they found him, Kubera appeared and revealed that Maniman was cursed by a sage to die by at man's hand. Since Bhima freed his army from the curse, Kubera gave him the flowers for Draupadi.

   Urvashi

Arjuna rejected her advances because Urvashi was his own ancestor, the wife of King Pururavas, so respectively called her his mother. But Urvashi grew angry and cursed him to lose his manhood for one year. So Arjuna posed as a eunuch, took the name Brihannala, and taught song and dance to the princess of the kingdom of Virata. Meanwhile, Bhima disguised himself as a chef named Vallabh.

   Yudhistira ruled Hastinapur for thirty-six years until he passed it down to his grandson. Near the end of Yudhistira's life, the Pandavas learned of Krishna's death, they decided to go to the Himalayas with Draupadi and make their journey to heaven, they were accompanied by a dog. But one-by-one, they fell down and died due to their imperfections. The order was Draupadi, she liked Arjuna more than the others, Sahadeva, he was smug over his knowledge, Nakula, he was arrogant about his good looks, Arjuna, he was always jealous of other archers, and Bhima, he was a glutton. Only Yudhistira managed to make it to the top. When he refused to enter heaven without the dog, Dharma Raja revealed that he took the form to keep him company.

Aru Shah and Mini soon discovered that they were the reincarnations of Arjuna and Yudhistira respectively. Mini originally got very upset by this as she wanted be the reincarnation of one of the Ashvins' sons. Indra and Dharma Raja gave them Vajra and the latter's danda stick, but they wouldn't fully activate until later.

   Urvashi gave them a quest to go to the
   Kingdom of Death
   and look for the Pool of the Past so they can stop the Sleeper before the new moon arrives. On their quest, they remember the adventures their previous incarnations had. Aru used the tale of Arjuna and the fish’s eye to escape an illusion of the Palace of Illusions. Aru and Mini were successful in their quest, but the Sleeper escaped, he was actually the reincarnation of Duryodhana as well as Aru's biological father.
