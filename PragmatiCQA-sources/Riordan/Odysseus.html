Blinded and confused, the Cyclops staggered about, and Odysseus and his men escaped in a flock of the Cyclops' sheep.

When they were close enough to see Ithaca's lights, greed overcame Odysseus' crew, who promptly opened the bag in search of gold, and thus the winds blew them back to Aeolia. The god of the winds angrily dismissed them as cursed by the gods. Since they didn't have a choice, they started the hard way to Ithaca without the god's help.

Upon hearing a prophecy they sail back to Circe's and then restart the long way back home. At Aeaea (Circe's island) one crew member, Elpenor, was so excited at the prospect of returning home, that he, in a drunken stupor, accidentally fell off the roof of a building and broke his neck. This forced the crew to return to Aeaea to give him a proper burial.

As Odysseus and his men set sail once more, Helios beseeched Zeus destroy Odysseus' ship for revenge, and thus a sea storm wrecksed the ship, killing all but Odysseus, who didn't eat the meat of the sacred cattle. Clinging to a part of his ship, the gods sent him to Ogygia (

Fortunately for him, the goddess Ino appeared and gifted him with a magical veil which would protect him from drowning. After the storm ceased, he washed onto the island Scheria, in which the Phaeaceans lived. There he encountered Nausicaa, who spotted him as she played upon the shore, when he stumbled up to her clothed in nothing but a tree branch, and King Alcinous, her father. There, he recounted his story, which is how the reader gets insight into what he went through. The Phaeaceans then bear him to Ithaca. However, when he arrives, Athena clothes the island in mist, as to initially obscure his home, and then she dramatically reveals it to him.

   He then encountered his faithful swineherd, Eumaeus, with whom he had short discourse, and also he met his son. However, he kept his identity hidden from the public. He was received into the palace of Penelope, who was beleaguered by suitors following Odysseus' departure for Ilion. While he was being washed by a maid, the maid recognized him from a scar he had on his leg, but Odysseus bade her not to reveal anything to Penelope. He then began to conspire with his son to get revenge upon the suitors. While dining, several suitors, such as Eurymachus, began insulting Odysseus, even hitting him with a footstool, but Odysseus did not react.

   At the palace, he was faced by a beggar, Arnaeus (also called Irus, the masculine form of Iris, because of his willingness to run messages), who challenged him to a fight after insulting him. Odysseus agreed, and broke Irus' jaw with a single strike.

  <p key="93daf6de-df86-476a-9630-e38eaba77443">
   Finally, it was decided by Penelope that she would marry whosoever could string the great bow of Odysseus, and shoot an arrow through twelve axes. Each suitor tried, including Antinous (the leader) and Eurymachus, however, none could even string the bow. Finally, Odysseus (disguised as a beggar) strung the bow and shot it through the axes. He then revealed himself, and the battle in the hall began.

   Together with Telemachus and two faithful servants, he killed all the suitors (only a singer and a musician get out alive because of Telemachus' mercy). Telemachus also hanged all of the maids who had been flirtatious with such suitors.

   Initially, after Odysseus revealed himself to Penelope, she was doubtful, as it had been twenty years. Thus she asked their marriage bed to be brought thither, which she knew to be rooted to the ground (being constructed around a tree). Odysseus was first confused, and thought she had cut down the tree, and accused her of destroying the bed. It was because of this that Penelope knew Odysseus was truly her husband, and they rejoiced, to finally be in each other's embrace after two decades apart.

   After that, Ithaca entered chaos, as the fathers of the suitors went after Odysseus and his followers looking for revenge. The gods stopped the civil war in the middle of the battle and peace was made, keeping Ithaca from destruction. He later made peace with Poseidon by making a sacrifice for him in the land where people did not know about the sea.

   to rediscover Ogygia. However, Odysseus needed a crystal from the island to complete it and did not take one with him. The astrolabe was eventually stolen by the
   Kerkopes
