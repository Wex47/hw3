   on the night of the new moon. The trio comes across a narrow passage and barely miss a blast of fire, meaning they’re getting close. They then encounter—and are chased by—
   strixes
   ; owl-like creatures who eat human flesh and curse anyone who kills them. Upon reaching a large circular chamber, Meg and Grover manage to hold most of them off with tomato plants, but one breaks free and manages to paralyze Apollo. Grover, who can talk to animals, tries to make peace with the strix; but it replies that the emperor commanded them to eat them. Meg accidentally kills that strix by sending it flying into the brick wall. She and Grover then strengthen the tomato barrier and duct tape Apollo to Grover's back. During the climb, Apollo takes the
   Arrow of Dodona
   out for advice about the strixes. Meg tries and fails to summon
   Peaches
   to help fight, and the strixes manage to break the tomato barrier. The arrow says that they can be repelled with pig entrails and "arbutus". Grover suddenly summons Panic, which he

The top of the chamber is a domed ceiling, and Grover claims that it looks familiar. He and Meg realize that arbutus plants resemble strawberries. The strixes are returning leading Meg to plant her seeds on the ramp. Grover and Apollo use music to make them explode like fireworks, which the strixes hate. Suddenly, the chamber begins to rumble as the strawberries break through the dome, flooding the chamber with sunlight, which kills the strixes. Apollo, Meg, and Grover use them as a trampoline to get out. Apollo gives Meg

   In a

After the woman dissolves into flames, the dream transitions to a terrace near the

   Apollo wakes up on a tarp in the desert near twilight. He realizes that he and Meg have been unconscious for hours. They are currently on the outskirts of

   Finding the store takes forever, because Grover keeps getting sidetracked. Night falls, the western horizon glows ominously from flames, smoke blots out the stars. Apollo remembers the wave of flames in the Labyrinth. Despite his fuzzy memories, Apollo was sure that woman was the
   Erythraean Sibyl
   , the next Oracle he has to free from the emperors. Grover explains that the flames are the cause of the natural disasters, fires have been gathering in the Labyrinth underneath Southern California like an infection. It obviously unnatural and it's killing Grover's friends, he feels bad that Pan faded, he could've stopped this. Grover thinks the emperor is responsible for this but all he knows is that he uses the name Neos Helios (Greek for New Sun), it's being referred to as the Burning Maze. The heroes stop at a major intersection, across the boulevard is a warehouse store with a sign:
   MACRO’S MILITARY MADNESS

   Apollo and Grover head into the store, the satyr doesn't smell any monsters. As predicted, Gleeson Hedge was in the firearms section, whistling as he stuffed his shopping trolley with rifle scopes and barrel brushes. The store manager tricks Apollo into telling him that he is the god who's now human. It turns out that all the employees are

   Naevius Sutorius Macro
   , praetor who used to serve the emperor. He wants to capture Apollo so that he gets into the emperor’s good graces, he was the stronger man in the dream who killed emperor Tiberius. Macro reveals that the west emperor's full name is Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, upon hearing this Apollo tells Grover and Coach Hedge to run. But Gleeson charged at Macro in an attempt to kill him, luckily Apollo pulls Hedge away and they ran down an aisle trying to escape. Grover gets separated in the confusion. They try to get out the front doors after Coach Hedge executed a perfect roundhouse kick at Macro, but the doors are locked. Grover knocked over a canoeing display and temporarily immobilizes the Praetor. They head to the back room and barricade the door and try desperately to open the back door. Grover notices more automatons and tells Apollo to activate them. When they are all online, Apollo "accidentally" activates
   Plan Twenty-Three
   , and, as soon as Macro breaks down the door, the automatons surround him and his employees and start to steam and heat up. Grover realizes the automatons thought he ordered a different plan, Plan Petersburg instead of Plan Thermopylae, and they start to self destruct. The two satyrs get the door open and pull out Apollo before the store explodes with Macro.

They find Piper at the end of the fireplace, then as Piper recognizes Grover and hears the recounting of their previous adventures, she invites them to the terrace for a private conversation. She fills them in on what she knows about the maze and the previous attempt she made with Jason to find the heart of the maze. From the way she says Jason's name, Apollo and Meg deduce that Jason and Piper have broken up, and Piper verbally jabs them about it explaining that "things change." Meg peeks at the legal documents covering the desks, and Piper proceeds to explain how Caligula has been working for years, spending tens of millions of dollars to ruin her dad, destroying everything-her dad's credit, assets, reputation, all the studios, etc. She mentions how Mellie spotted the trouble and tried to prevent it but was too late,
   Jane
   among others were in on the plan. After some more chatter, they get to the subject of how Meg's life was also ruined by an emperor and Piper embraces the younger girl. Finally, Apollo gets to the point of why they're here, and Piper grabs her weapons -
   Katoptris
   , and a blowgun with poison darts, "borrows" a car from her neighbor,
   Mr. Bedrossian
   , and they set off for the maze.

Apollo relays the information to Piper, and while Medea is occupied by Meg, Piper snipes Medea, scoring a hit, and Medea laughs at the blowgun, ridicules the poison, then topples over, warning them that she wasn't summoning Helios-she was holding him back. Apollo understands what that means, and yells for them to run. A few moments later, the parking lot goes supernova. They make it out, and Grover uses healing tunes to keep them alive until they reach Aeithales, where Aloe Vera finishes healing them.

   After Apollo wakes up with a gasp, a conference is held in Aeithales. The heroes settle on a plan: Steal Caligula's shoes so they can navigate the maze. The problem being that they don't know where Caligula is. Piper recalls that Jason knew and they set off for
   Edgarton Day and Boarding School
   . Piper charmspeaks the teachers and staff, letting Jason out of class and they discuss things in his dorm room. Jason reports that the facility has been infiltrated: he has already slain a

   . Then Piper interrupts, getting them back onto the topic of the Burning Maze. Jason tells them some information that he'd held back - the things Apollo already knew from his dream - that the Maze itself was a trap for Apollo, that Jason and Piper couldn't do anything, and that Apollo has to be the one to rescue the sybil. If they themselves tried, it would be "too dangerous". Piper laughs at that, and mentions Medea in passing. They explain this problem to Jason and then Piper goes to the office to bust Jason out, taking Meg along just in case the empousa decides to attack them. Jason then reveals to Apollo that the Sybil also told him that, if Jason and Piper went to find the emperor, one of them would "three letter word, starts with 'd'". In other words, one would die. Jason also makes him promise that since he and Piper are going after Caligula with Apollo, if Jason is the one to die, Apollo would take his designs to New Rome. He also extracts another promise from Apollo - to remember his human experiences after he retains his place on Olympus. After they rejoin Piper and Meg and head off to find the emperor in
   Santa Barbara
   , Jason admits there was more to the prophecy, and tells Piper. Nevertheless, Piper and Jason agree to not let each other die.

   It is now the night of the new moon. After reaching the
   Stearns Wharf
   at Santa Barbara, our heroes are eating some fish tacos, when Jason spots a huge boat on the horizon, with two helicopters on it, and a small submarine on the side. Then a second identical yacht appears, then a third, until dozens of yachts form a line across the harbor:

   much influence. The heroes decide to go to the middle boat despite Apollo and Jason disagreeing on how strong it is, but searchlights light up from the boats and small patrol boats crisscrossed the harbor. Strixes will be coming soon, owls are evil in the Cherokee stories too so Piper is scared as well. She charmspeaks three men in a boat (one using the searchlight, one with the engine, and one carrying an assault rifle) to accept a bribe so they can buy dinner at the docks for themselves. She also steals their outfits, weapons, and communication devices for herself and her friends.

   Upon reaching the yacht, they discovered it's named JULIA DRUSILLA XXVI. Julia Drusilla was Caligula's younger sister, he loved her so much that died at a very young age from that suffocating love. All of the yachts are named after her, they have to search them quickly for Caligula's shoes before they're detected. Jason flies everyone up. Once onboard, Apollo tells Meg about how Zeus made him mortal the first time because Zeus was angry that Apollo had killed the

   . This makes Meg kick him in the shin saying that was dumb, Apollo compares this to her anger towards Caligula instead of Nero. They are then surrounded by more "Big Ears" holding khandas, the actual name of the race is
   pandai
   . Two archer ones then come and attack Jason and Piper, only the Pandai were around them, there weren't any alarms. The largest pandos guard named
   Amax
   explains that they can hear the lies Apollo is telling, but he is very surprised the Meg is Nero's stepdaughter. The archers,
   Timbre
   and
   Crest
   , are told to steady their weapons,
   Peak
   is the fourth pandos who helps take them all below for interrogations. Near some heavy oak doors, a human mercenary named

   scimitars
   , Jason uses lightning to kill Timbre, Crest was actually the pandos from L.A. and Apollo spares him. He unintentionally uses the arrow of Dodona to shoot Grunk dead. Apollo and Piper decide to go to boat forty-three for the shoes while Meg and Jason take care of the emperor.

   Pandai and strixes were flying above to see what that lightning was, but the ships were lightly guarded. They go through boats with a water park, spa, and literal moveable feast. On boat thirty-one, they were about to be ambushed by human mercenaries and cyclopes. Piper suddenly began to sang Joe Walsh's ‘Life of Illusion’, Apollo joined her with his ukulele, everyone just stood there letting the heroes pass. Boat forty is a huge wardrobe without shoes, Piper reveals that her dad put the song on when he got his first acting career. Regarding Jason, Apollo remembers the time he dated Grand Duchess Tatiana Romanov but Piper assures him that their relationship was only because of Hera, and

On Julia Drusilla XLIII, Apollo plays Tiny Tim's 'Tiptoe through the Tulips' causing Wah-Wah and the other pandai to force them to reveal the location of the caligae. Lots of shoe pairs were on tons of pedestals, Apollo and Piper couldn't decide which one to take, but they see leather sandals in the corner of the room. Suddenly, Crest arrives wanting Apollo to teach him how to play the C minor six tri-chord because Meg and Jason have already been captured by the emperor. Then Incitatus appears and attacks the trio, some pandai tied them onto his back so they can be taken to the emperor. Apollo was going to attack but Incitatus warns him not to, as he can feel it. He reveals that Medea will put Apollo in chains and flay his human form to extract his remaining godly essence, with that combined Caligula will become the new sun god. After that, he intends to overthrow the human race and institute a government by and for horses.

   After witnessing several boats damaged by Jason and Meg, the trio is taken to the twelfth. In the throne is Caligula on his dais, Medea, and Reverb with twelve other pandai. Jason and Meg were trapped in Medea's swirling columns of wind with glittering shrapnel. The emperor has some pandai wake Piper up, after that he taunts Apollo but Medea is getting tired of controlling her wind. Reverb is told to cut Wah-Wah's heart out for not having stopped Apollo before, but Crest is spared because Caligula finds him harmless and amusing. Then he taunts all three of the demigods and reveals that the seeds Phillip McCaffrey will reincarnate the "blood-born/silver wives". Piper attempts to use charmspeak but is knocked out by Caligula, Apollo fails to attack as well. The emperor says he didn't have it all bad because he wasn't a god from the start like Apollo. Before Medea can kill Meg and Jason, Apollo pulls out the arrow of Dodona threatening to kill himself. Caligula actually grows worried because if he's dead Medea can't extract his magic, he wants him to stop saying he doesn't play games like

   pandos
   named Flange comes in and reveals that the attack on Camp Jupiter that night has failed, Caligula kills him as a result. Another pandos named Boost spreads the word around the other ships that they're sailing north to the Bay Area. Apollo quickly stabs himself but misses his heart, Caligula and Medea desperately try to extract the magic, using that time, Jason made the cages of venti explode. Luckily, no one was hurt by the blast of shrapnel, except Meg who was sent flying out of the yacht. Apollo has Crest rescue her, Jason draws his
   gladius
   and summons
   Tempest
   , ready to fight Caligula on Incitatus. Medea disappears before Piper can fight her, pandai have arrived and are now shooting arrows at Jason while he's controlling thunderstorms. After he yells "GO! Remember!" Jason Grace is stabbed in the back with Caligula's golden spear and dies. He falls off Tempest who carries Apollo and Piper to safety, Piper is devastated and seething with rage.

However, all the phones are down with the exception of Crest's so with Apollo's help, he calls 9-1-1. Piper is very furious and understandably upset about their situation, and in her anger, screams at Apollo to "just GO!" Apollo believes that Jason's tragedy was his fault, he begins to think that if he had never bothered Jason and Piper, this would never have happened. Apollo and Meg then leave for Palm Springs in Gleeson's car with Crest.
