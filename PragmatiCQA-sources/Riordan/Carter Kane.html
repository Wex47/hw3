   Greek mythology

They eventually find the crocodile terrorizing a small cul-de-sac with a few kids spraying the monster with water guns and hitting it with water balloons. Carter sees a gold necklace around the crocodile's neck and tells Percy that they need to remove it to stop the monster, as it cannot be killed. Percy tells Carter to distract the crocodile so that he could get it. Carter makes a large avatar of

As Carter's avatar fades and the crocodile crashes into a house, Carter and Percy switch places. Percy creates a massive whirlpool in the center of the cul-de-sac using the water generated by the crocodile. The crocodile is swept up in it and Carter manages to make it to the necklace. As Percy begins to tire, Carter finally manages to remove it and the crocodile returns to its original form; that of a baby crocodile.

   Percy and Carter run off with the baby crocodile after hearing some cop cars approaching. Resting at a nearby diner, Percy and Carter watch the news, as they report that a freak sewer incident had destroyed the homes in the cul-de-sac. Carter and Percy wonder if someone is trying to bring them together to cause trouble and agree to keep their respective worlds a secret from each other until the time is right. Carter takes the necklace and the baby crocodile with him, but places an enchantment on Percy's hand so that if he ever needs to contact him, all he has to do is say his name. The two part on good terms, but Carter knows that some day in the middle of the night, he'll wake up to the sound of Percy calling him.

Carter's specialty is combat magic although he uses other types of magic from the Path of Horus to fight as well. However, his skill in areas other than combat magic is rather limited due to his lack of proper training and those kinds of magic not being his specialty. For example, in

When Carter finally accomplishes it, the action is done in a moment of instinct during combat rather than being purposefully directed. Over time, Carter has gotten better at using other forms of magic, but his skill still tends to be lacking and rudimentary at best, causing Carter to usually prefer to leave such tasks to others such as Sadie or

He used this when heading towards Thoth's base in Memphis and found the demons attacking him to be connected to Apophis through red coils of Chaos energy. He also realized that Thoth was trapped there and his magic was being blocked from leaving his pyramid. Whilst using surveillance magic, he saw Thoth in his ancient animal-headed form. Carter can also tap into the power of Horus to increase his surveillance magic and expand his senses greatly.

     and wand, Carter used the crook and flail of Ra in a brief fight against Menshikov. Before that, Carter used them to shatter the dazed Zia's staff by making an X formation. By lashing the crook and flail through the air and using his mind, he can direct a telekinetic force towards his enemies, which becomes more effective whilst using combat magic. Additionally, because the flail channels Ra's power, Carter has limited fire magic; such as summoning columns of fire and setting the flail on fire. Carter was even able to injure Apophis after he attacked him in a rage with flail, causing three burn marks to appear on the Serpent's neck that did not heal. Carter was allowed to keep these by Ra after the battle. Afterwards, he left them on the throne after becoming

    Carter hosted the god and became friends with him, but would become frequently annoyed by him. Horus at first always demanded control of Carter's body and tended to be arrogant and obnoxious, though Carter grew fond of him. Carter picked up some of Horus' traits from their brief merge and Horus developed respect and trust for him in return. However, when Carter brings back Ra, Horus is furious with him and it strains their relationship with Horus threatening him with terrible punishment if they fail to defeat Apophis and worse if he's defeated without Ra's help, though he promises to keep sharing his power with Carter and publicly supports Carter and calls him his brother. This strain apparently didn't last long as Horus visits Carter in person through a pigeon to give him advice and talks with him about magic that is completely forbidden by the gods, showing a level of trust that even Thoth didn't show. After Carter and Sadie destroy Apophis, Horus leaves Carter without even a goodbye and Carter believes Horus just used him and was never his friend, just discarding him when he didn't need him anymore. However, according to Bast, this is not so, Horus just had to go and a god would never treat someone like that. Horus apparently also rips off Carter's own acceptance speech for the pharaoh of the House of Life for his own speech as the restored pharaoh of the gods which Bast explains is because Horus will now mirror Carter.

     Percy and Carter originally have clashing personalities and try to fight each other at first with water and magic. Despite this, they become allies and work together to defeat the
     Son of Sobek
     . Carter puts the eye of Horus on Percy's palm so that if he says "Carter" he will be summoned.

     Despite meeting only once, Carter and the daughter of Athena work well together. They were able to work together to form a strategy to take down Setne and execute it with a successful outcome in phases. She trusted him enough to allow him to use
     her hat
     for the plan despite only meeting him not even an hour before hand.
    </p>
    After the
    Battle of Governors Island
    was over and Setne was trapped in a snow globe, they had lunch with Percy and Sadie and parted ways on good terms.
