   Matthew

   Bobby

   When Annabeth was seven years old, she and her father visited their family for Thanksgiving at the Chase Mansion in Boston. This included her oldest uncle, Randolph, and her aunt Natalie and her son Magnus Chase, who was unbeknownst to Annabeth a demigod son of

Annabeth, while constructing a pantheon out of a set of Randolph's runestones, told Magnus to be careful, and that she was going to run away. A few moments later, Frederick and Annabeth left. Natalie also appeared to take Magnus away, and Annabeth would not see her cousin for years after that.

She would subsequently scream for her father, who was always away for work, so her stepmother would see her. Whenever her stepmother came into her bedroom, the spiders would hide, so her stepmother thought Annabeth was making it up to scare her stepbrothers and refused to call Frederick. By the time, she got dressed each morning, the marks of the painful bites inflicted on her had already faded, leaving the cobwebs, which didn't make for a convincing proof.

Upon finding that Annabeth was a demigod, Luke and Thalia agreed that she could run away with them and Luke promised that he wouldn't let anything hurt her and they would become a better family than her old family, a promise he would break some years later.

   Together, they went on the run, fighting monsters and making hideouts on the East Coast which were woven from plants, like Native American huts. (Said huts still contain sleeping bags, blankets, ice chests, and kerosene lamps, along with Celestial Bronze javelin tips, quivers with arrows, swords, and nectar/ambrosia.)

From that point on, Luke was never the same and began to act like he had something to prove, which the young Annabeth didn't see as a problem since Luke was her personal hero. They got into more skirmishes because of his recklessness, fighting more monsters since Luke wanted to pick a fight with each one he came across. They once ran into

She leads Percy and Silena to the dragon's head, then the three of them drag it away from Ant Hill. Led by Annabeth, they look for the dragon's body, finally finding it in another part of the
   woods
   . Annabeth repairs the dragon to the best of her abilities, then activates it. The three of them lead the

   back to Ant Hill, where he attacks the Myrmekes and buys time while Annabeth, Percy, and Silena find Beckendorf and get him to safety. They kill several Myrmekes on their way out. The four of them then deactivate the dragon. Annabeth helps Percy (who got a bit of Myrmeke acid through his shoe) limp through the woods, back towards camp. Percy and Annabeth are just starting to talk about the subject of the fireworks on the 4th of July when three of her siblings from the
   Athena's Cabin
   jump out of the bushes and congratulate Annabeth for capturing two prisoners, Percy and Beckendorf. Annabeth puts them in her team's jail, with them protesting all the way. She then asks Percy "See you at the fireworks?" and leaves without waiting for his answer.

Annabeth was worried and didn’t even know if Magnus was alive, and told her father he might be dead in a ditch somewhere. They decided to head to a youth center on Charles street to see if he was there, after Randolph called them and said he wasn’t at the nearest homeless shelter.

   Magnus reunited with Annabeth after ten years when he visited his own funeral, and she walked in. Annabeth was ecstatic to see him and tackled him in a hug, saying she knew he wasn't dead. Magnus blinked tears out of his eyes and said it was good to see her, and she said that she thought he was dead, and called him a butt. Annabeth thought that the body was fake and he was faking his death, but Magnus didn't deny that, since he didn't know how to explain the Norse afterlife to her. Magnus tried to leave to find his friends, but Annabeth told him not to and that she needed some answers, and reassured him she had been in dangerous situations before. She told him that Randolph hadn't told her anything except for that he was in danger because of his birthday, and he was taking him to the bridge. After Magnus told her there was a connection between his mother's death, the bridge, and who is father is, Annabeth offered to take him to

She gave him her phone number and he kissed her cheek, and she called him a butt.

   Magnus and Annabeth reunited on the Blue Hills after Magnus's quest, and spilled Natalie's ashes, with Annabeth remarking it is a lot better than the last memorial she attended. She said that Natalie was great and that they cremated Magnus's former body instead, with his ashes placed in a family mausoleum. She said that the service was hard on Randolph, who seemed shaken up, and confided that it was hard for her to hide what actually happened from her father, due to their rocky history and her efforts to try to be honest with him. Magnus apologized, saying he didn't want to rope Annabeth into his problems, but she said she understands more than he thinks. Magnus reassured her that he was okay and staying with "friends", and she asked for details, but Magnus said he didn’t want to put her in danger. Annabeth burst out laughing and said that her life was weird, and Magnus said he felt normal around her, and they shook hands, deciding to not hold secrets and make the next Chase family generation less messed up. They decided to bet on who's story as weirder and went to

Annabeth also explained to Magnus how the Chase family had a special connection to gods, with both cousins being demigods from two different pantheons. She told him that all the old myths were true as long as their stories survived, and they fed off of human memory. She also told Magnus about

Annabeth said that was sweet and kissed Percy on the cheek. After, Annabeth rapped her knuckles on Percy's head after he and Alex discussed what they called the

   Annabeth said her goodbyes to Magnus and gave him a big hug and told him to take care, and ordered him to come back safely. Magnus promised, saying that Chases have to stick together. The last thing she did was ask Magnus if he was at Randolph's yet, since he needed to go through his things, and Magnus promised to that day. The last Magnus saw of Percy and Annabeth was Percy singing badly to Led Zeppelin in his Toyota Prius, and Annabeth laughing at his bad voice.

When she was young, the spiders would attack her at night and hide again when it was morning. Her stepmother would never believe her, thinking that the cobwebs were some sort of clever trick. In

Although after Percy makes a fool of himself to the Hermes' Cabin, she decides he can't be it and yells at him for it. She was shown to be very cold towards Percy and found him annoying at first, which only became worse after finding out his father was Poseidon, her mother's rival. However, Annabeth began to open up a little to Percy during their quest, especially after he helped her escape from mechanical spiders. Following this and opening up about their personal lives, Annabeth fully resolved that she considered Percy a friend and was even willing to sacrifice herself to allow him and his mother to leave the underworld. Despite this, she still doesn't like to show her feelings outright.

When he asks her why she did it, she admits she knows he would do the same for her. Percy trusts her to tell her where his Achilles heel is, his only weak spot. After the defeat of Kronos and saving of Luke's soul, Annabeth confides to Luke as he dies that she always saw him as a brother, but never loved him. When Percy was offered immortality by the Olympians, he saw that Annabeth was very pale and suspected she was having a panic similar to the one he had when he thought she was going to join the Hunters of Artemis.

Nevertheless, after Percy saved them from Geryon, Annabeth told Nico that Bianca's death wasn't Percy's fault and that Kronos would do anything to get Nico on his side, and that Bianca wouldn’t want to be brought back to life by him. But this made Nico more upset, telling Annabeth that she didn’t care about Bianca, and that if she did she would help him. But even after everything Nico said to her, Annabeth helped him summon Bianca's ghost and kept spirits away from him. She also told Nico that his sister was right when she told him that his anger will be his doom, and reminded him again that Kronos would do anything to get him on his side. The next morning, Annabeth tried to convince him to join the group, saying that Bianca just wanted him to be okay, and put her hand on his shoulder, but he brushed her off and walked away. After he left, Annabeth told Percy she was worried about him and scared he would talk to

     Westover Hall
     . However, Annabeth herself has no feelings for him beyond kinship, since he is too young, too moody, and has a certain darkness in him that makes Annabeth uneasy. Furthermore, she has always found it hard to "read" Nico and his actions. However, Annabeth still admits to feeling responsible for him, and can relate to feeling like Nico did after Bianca's death—a homeless orphan, drifting through the world alone. Annabeth was upset when she found out about Nico's imprisonment, and listened to the news sadly, shaking her head, but she wasn't surprised at all by the news, and figured out he would die on the Kalends of July. She also figured out rescuing him was a trap, but felt a responsibility to save him.

Later, when Nico arrived back on the ship, Nico reassured Leo that Percy Annabeth were not dead, and if they were he would feel it.

However when he and Nico went to Croatia, he thought his "crush" was bigger than he thought and was a deeper love. At first, Nico tried to lie to Jason, saying he left Camp Half-Blood because he crushed on Annabeth, but then admitted that he wasn’t. Jason connected the dots and it is finally revealed that Nico was actually jealous of Annabeth, not in love with her, due to her relationship with

After seeing Annabeth and Percy holding hands, Nico looks pained, showing that his secret crush on Percy is as strong as ever, although Hazel just thought it was because he went through Tartarus alone. As for Annabeth, in Tartarus, she was in disbelief when she found out Nico helped them, and said she had no idea what drove him, and couldn't figure him out. When he left with Reyna and Hedge, she wished I’m good luck, and he wished her good luck in return, without making eye contact.

While Nico is still very jealous of Annabeth, and wants to hate her, he cannot bring himself to, since Annabeth's gratitude was genuine and sincere, and she never overlooked or avoided Nico like most people. Hence, Nico admits to himself that it would have been far easier for him if she were a horrible person. Later in the book, when Hades reveals to Nico that one of the Seven is destined to die, the idea of any of them (even Annabeth) dying made him feel empty—like he was back in the dark Giants' Bronze Jar. By the end of the book, Nico finally finds the courage to tell Percy and Annabeth about his past crush on Percy, coming out for the first time. By that point, however, Nico has come to realize that Percy is not his type, and that he is genuinely happy for Percy and Annabeth.

Coach Hedge was stubborn but was never crazy enough to defy Annabeth, even if he didn't want to do something, like when Annabeth ordered him to check if the fires were out, even though he already did it and grumbled, he did it anyway. However, he still felt a level of responsibility over Annabeth, even though she didn't take him seriously and wasn't worried about getting in trouble by him. He was furious when she spent the night in the stables with Percy, being so mad he knocked down a cup of apples with his bat, and said she was irresponsible and broke the rules, and thought she would have more common sense. After the incident, he was insistent that Percy and Annabeth don't go anywhere together and insisted that while he goes with Percy and Frank, the remaining crew watch Annabeth to make sure she is out of trouble.

Jason also thought that Annabeth had a distracted look, thinking a million things at once. Annabeth later walked in on Jason looking at pictures to check on him, and encouraged him and said he would do fine on the quest. She also told Jason that he was most likely a loner who survived fighting monsters before he arrived at Camp, though she was unsure where he got the tattoos. Jason also confided to Annabeth about his dream and Annabeth gave him advice for the quest. Annabeth even told Jason about Thalia and Luke, but their newfound friendship came to a halt when he said that Thalia was his sister, thinking that he was lying.

After Annabeth Judo flipped Percy, Jason introduced her to Reyna, saying that Annabeth usually didn't Judo flip people. Reyna asked if she was sure that Annabeth wasn't a Roman or an Amazon, and Annabeth, not sure if that was a compliment, said that she only attacked Percy like that and shook Reyna's hand, which Reyna accepted.

Reyna said her surrender would be the better option than letting her legion destroy Camp Half-Blood. Annabeth said she would follow the Mark of Athena to Rome and fix the grudge between the Camps. At that moment, Annabeth noticed that Reyna had the same expression on her face when she found out about Jason's relationship with Piper. Annabeth recognized that Reyna felt betrayed by Jason, and she was too bitter, lonely and believed nothing could go right for her in the future. Despite this, Reyna reluctantly let her go and stalled Octavian, respecting her boldness, but she warned her that the next time they met, it would be in battle, ending the friendship for now.

     Annabeth holds her mother in very high regard, often trying to follow her example. She would often carry out her actions in accordance to what she thinks Athena would do, stating "Athena always has a plan". Likewise, her mother trusts Annabeth and sees her daughter as "her pride and joy". They seem to discuss many things and have a set of plans in preparation for any catastrophe. Athena made Annabeth the new architect of Olympus after the damage caused during the

    Part of the reason Annabeth disliked Percy when they first met was because she felt that they should hate each other because their parents do, though she later decided she liked Percy enough to be his friend regardless of what her mother would think. Athena disapproved of her daughter's relationship with Percy and claimed that keeping him alive would be dangerous to the

    when talking about him with his demigod son Percy, she expressed very little respect for him as his mother's rival. She felt that she should dislike him and his children due to his rivalry with Athena, though she seemed to have lost this opinion over time, in part due to her friendship and eventual romance with his demigod son. Unlike Athena, Poseidon has not shown any ill will to his son's relationship with her. In fact, he may even support their relationship considering her and Percy's third kiss was in his domain.

She is a formidable fighter and shows her book counterpart's ability to react to events that happened in Greek mythology, such as warning Percy about the Hydra in the fight in Nashville (which was in the guise of the replica Parthenon's janitors) and the story of

   Alexandra Daddario reprises her role as Annabeth Chase (also played by Alisha Newton in a flashback) in The Lightning Thief's 2013 sequel Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters. The actress had chosen to dye her hair blonde for the role due to the demands of the fans and the desire to be loyal to the original book series.

   The film opens with a flashback following young Annabeth, Grover, Luke, and their friend Thalia Grace running towards Camp Half-Blood while being pursued by monsters. The group halts to a panicked stop when a tree falls on Grover, trapping his leg underneath. Thalia sacrifices herself for the protection of her friends as she meets her demise by holding off the monsters. Young Annabeth and her friends witness Thalia's growth into a tree and the creation of the invisible borders around the camp created by Zeus.

   Cutting to a new scene set present day, Annabeth is cheering on Percy Jackson in his competition against Clarisse La Rue. Percy almost reaches his objective and wins the tournament when he spots another fellow camper in need of help and Annabeth watches as his fatal flaw takes over and he chooses to help out a friend over winning. She and Grover, who had been betting on Percy, rush over to help Percy when he is knocked out. Following his defeat, Clarisse brags about her performance and calls Percy's last quest a stroke of luck. Annabeth and Grover defend him against her taunts and attempt to console him afterwards when he begins to doubt himself. Mr. Dionysus, the god of wine and camp director, and Chiron investigate into the case of a Cyclops somehow making its way through the Camp barriers who is revealed to be Tyson, Percy's half-brother. Upon this discovery, Annabeth treats Tyson with immediate dislike and apprehension.
  </p>
  <p key="0ab2031e-5ed2-45a9-bc70-eca068412d46">
   The campers tease Percy and Tyson, with Annabeth sitting nearby with the Athena campers when the camp is attacked by a Colchis Bull. Annabeth tag teams with Percy, ordering him to distract the bull while she stabs it. The plan quickly falls apart when it does minimal damage and Annabeth flees the scene. Percy finally defeats the monster with the help of Grover, Annabeth, and Clarisse. Luke Castellan confronts Percy who tries to persuade Percy to align with him. Percy declines the offer and Luke disappears. Meeting with the rest of the camp at Thalia's tree, they declare that Thalia's Tree has been poisoned. Annabeth questions who would do such a thing when Percy announces it was Luke's plan to poison the tree. Annabeth, relieved by her friend's appearance and confirmed safety, runs up and hugs him while the campers realize that with Thalia's Tree poisoned it has left the camp and its campers vulnerable to future attacks. Questioning a prophecy that Luke had mentioned earlier in their meeting, Percy visits the Oracle for answers while Annabeth proposes a quest to Mr. D to search for The Golden Fleece, the only object capable of restoring Thalia's Tree. Dionysus originally shoots down the quest idea but announces it later that night, appointing Clarisse to lead it much to Annabeth's dismay and annoyance.

  <p key="aae20b8a-d2a5-43be-9dbd-8ac05befb7d8">
   Grover and Annabeth are convinced by Percy to head out and look for the Fleece. The group is accompanied by Tyson despite Annabeth's protests. Realizing that Tyson's eye would be a problem for the group, she sprays Mist on him in order to create the illusion that he has two eyes instead of one. Hailing the Taxi of Damnation, the four of them are ejected from the cab in Washington DC, but not before Percy receives the coordinates for the Sea of Monsters by threatening them with their one eye.

   Grover is kidnapped by Chris Rodriguez and friends although Annabeth, Percy, and Tyson attempt to foil the attack and get him back. With Grover gone, the three of them are dejected before Annabeth leads them to Hermes who offers them a thermos that releases the wind from the four corners of the Earth and a magical box sealer that can make anything disappear when taped around any border. George and Martha, two snakes on Hermes staff, give the trio information about Luke's whereabouts, including that he's currently settled on the Princess Andromeda. Tyson asks Poseidon for assistance across the water to get to Luke's yacht and is answered by the arrival of a hippocampus. Percy hesitates, disappointed with his own lack of response from Poseidon whenever he attempts to communicate with him. Annabeth encourages Percy to get on the hippocampi and he does, the two sharing a smile as she glides her hand through the water and looks back at him.

  <p key="56be1df5-d28a-40d8-a306-e38c0be8edee">
   Annabeth is captured along with Percy and Tyson when they find their way onto the yacht where they find out about Luke's plan to resurrect Kronos and destroy Olympus. Annabeth voices Luke about her disappointment in him and his plans to destroy the gods after what Thalia had sacrificed for them. Luke's anger is mutual, not being able to understand why Annabeth would be siding with the gods. The three of them are held in the brig where Annabeth becomes suspicious of Tyson's involvement in their capture. Percy watches as Annabeth holds a piece of Thalia's Tree in her hand and looks over it worriedly. Percy frees them using the magical box sealer by putting the tape over the cell door, retrieved by Annabeth who snatched the bag as Percy manipulated the strength of the waves to knock it over and towards her. The group fights through Luke's men and a manticore to a boat where Annabeth uncaps the thermos to aid in their getaway.

  <p key="b430132b-965a-4a08-932f-9199edfeb8f0">
   Percy lets Tyson take over driving the boat with the thermos while he sits on the end with Annabeth. She admits that she wouldn't have let Tyson do it if she were Percy. Percy asks her why she hates Tyson so much and Annabeth reveals that it was a Cyclops that had killed Thalia and she hasn't been able to trust one ever since then. The boat is then consumed by Charybdis after Tyson loses the thermos and they discover that Clarisse and her crew have already been sucked in on their travels. Clarisse and Percy work together to concoct a plan to escape the monster's stomach, Annabeth and Tyson wishing Percy luck. The group escapes the monster and they arrive at Circle Island, Polyphemus's lair.
  </p>
  <p key="7fa73f87-be73-44d3-8b82-d3427334620d">
   Annabeth helps defeat Polyphemus and is surprised by Luke's arrival who demands the fleece from the group. Luke fires a crossbow at Percy who refused to hand over the fleece but it is Tyson who purposely takes the shot for Percy and falls down to the water below. Following Tyson's death, the four are tied up to posts as they watch Luke use the fleece to begin reviving Kronos. Percy, feeling the situation is hopeless, gives up before Annabeth gives him a pep talk and tells him to create his own destiny instead of thinking about what the Oracle prophesied. Percy uncaps Riptide in order to untie Grover from his post and Percy runs off to fight Luke as the rest of them are left to fight Luke's men.
  </p>
  <p key="69d7955f-751c-415b-ac17-6fbbaf34e4c3">
   Distracted by Tyson's reappearance, who explains that since he is a descendant from Poseidon the water healed his wounds, the fleece resurrects Kronos and the five of them work together to defeat him. Luke and Grover are captured by Kronos and swallowed, emitting a shocked reaction from Annabeth and Clarisse. Percy, remembering the lines from the prophecy ('cursed blade shall reap'), uses Riptide to slay the Titan and the others erupt in cheers over the victory. Luke and Grover were then spat out by Kronos during his defeat, Luke falling into Polyphemus's lair. Annabeth, happy about the demise of the Titan, is stabbed from the back by the Manticore who is later killed by Grover and Clarisse. Percy holds Annabeth in his arms as her friends look over her body in tears as she dies but is later brought back when Percy wraps her in the Fleece.

  <p key="f294e3b3-73e4-4fc1-8cf6-0c4ee094dcc8">
   Returning to Camp Half-Blood, Percy and his friends watch as Clarisse is given the honors to return the Fleece to Thalia's Tree and regain the tree's strength and the borders. All is well around the camp, with the campers celebrating their victory, until Grover runs up to Percy during a meal and warns him about something big happening. Percy, worried for Annabeth's safety since she was on duty, runs to the Thalia's Tree and is told by Annabeth that the Fleece had worked "too well". They inspect the tree and watch as Thalia regains her human form and is awaken. Confused, Thalia introduces herself as the daughter of Zeus. The movie ends with a voiceover from Percy talking about how Thalia's relation to one of the Big Three could change everything since he might not be the hero talked about in the prophecy.

   Her first name, 'Annabeth' is an anagram of 'Athena' with a few extra letters which are N and B. Annabeth is a variant of the Hebrew name, Anna, and the name means "God has favored me" as this could possibly been seen as Athena, her mother, very much favors her daughter. The third syllable of her name, Beth, is a common shortened form of another Hebrew name, Elizabeth, which means "my God is an oath" or perhaps "my God is abundance". Beth can also be a nickname for Bethany, a female name first used as the name of a town in the Christian Bible, which is believed to mean "house of figs".

   Chase is a Middle English surname, the occupational name for a hunter. In Middle English, the word "chase" means "hunt." This may come from that she has similar attributes with a huntress and almost decided to join the Hunters of Artemis.
