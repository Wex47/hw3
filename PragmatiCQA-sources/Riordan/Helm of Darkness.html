   , the Helm allows Hades to melt into shadows and pass through walls. While wearing it he cannot be touched, seen, or heard, and he can radiate fear so intense that it can easily drive a person insane or stop their heart. Grover also says that this is why most sane creatures fear the dark.

   initially shuddered with horror when they saw the infernal monster for the first time. However, the gods overcame their fear and were able to sneak in. Zeus managed to talk to the Cyclopes Brontes and convinced him to forge powerful weapons for him and his siblings (which would be more powerful than
   Kronos' Scythe
   ) behind Kampê's back. Together with his brothers Steropes and Arges, Brontes forged three incredibly powerful weapons, the third of which was the Helm of Darkness, which was given to Hades. The helm instantly made him invisible and generated such ineffable terror, that it scared his brothers Zeus and Poseidon to the point that both of them paled and started to sweat with fear, greatly satisfying Hades.
