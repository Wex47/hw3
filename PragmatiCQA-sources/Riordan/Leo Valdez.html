   Leonidas "Leo" Valdez was born in
   Houston
   ,
   Texas
   , to the mechanic
   Esperanza Valdez
   , and the blacksmith god Hephaestus. Unlike most of his half-siblings, Leo can control fire. He was the first child of Hephaestus to control fire born in centuries.
  </p>
  <p key="6d5c11f3-d184-4193-af13-a2c77430fae5">
   When Leo was just a baby, his mother took him to see his bisabuelo (great grandfather),
   Sammy Valdez
   . Sammy was overjoyed to see him and held him, chuckling and tickling his chin. Sammy told him about Hazel, and said he would not live to see her again. He told his great-grandson that a woman named Doña Callida had warned Hazel's danger would not happen in his lifetime, but he'd promised he would be there for her. He then told Leo to tell Hazel that he was sorry, and told him to help her. He told him to apologize for selling the diamond and that the diamond came with a curse: she never saw her again. He gave Leo his blessing and said he was special, just like Hazel.
  </p>
  <p key="5db7c346-704f-431e-94bd-cd831e22f684">
   Tía Callida decided to lay Leo down for a nap, and said she wanted to see if he was her brave little hero. She nestled him in blankets and laid him in what Leo thought were red and yellow pillows, but was actually a fireplace. He remembered sleeping comfortably, grabbing sparks. He dreamed of being on a boat made of fire, and Tía sang him lullabies as he slept, in Greek. He didn't know what the language was at the time. When Esperanza came home, she was furious, went to take Leo from the flames, and yelled, "How could you?", but Tía disappeared.
  </p>
  <p key="e6359449-c74c-489f-984d-17f9fa71dcc2">
   Tía continued to show up at his house, and when he was three, she let him play with knives, saying that he needed to learn his blades someday if he wanted to be her hero someday. When he was four, she found him a rattlesnake from a cow pasture, gave him a stick, and told him to poke it to show that he was brave, and the

   The last time she watched him was when he was five, she brought him paper and crayons, and sat on a picnic table under a pecan tree while Leo drew. As she sang songs, Leo drew a design of the

   . When he was about to sign his name, it flew away. Tía told him that it wasn't time yet to be a hero, and he will find his destiny, but first he had to face many sorrows. She then told him to make a fire to warm her old bones. A few minutes later, Esperanza came out and shrieked when she saw him sitting in the middle of a fire, with his hands burning the picnic table, and the crayons melted into goo. The fire left his handprints in the table, leaving the people in his apartment to wonder for years how he did it. After the visit, Esperanza had a talk with him and said she couldn't come back again, and he wasn't ready to be a hero. She told him to never use fire again until he met his father, and when he did, he would explain everything.

   He and his mom were very close. She taught him Morse code, and they would communicate using it, tapping messages on the walls. Esperanza would switch between English and Spanish when she talked to him, and made him bilingual. It took years for him to realize not everyone spoke that way. His mom worked at her machine shop since no one would hire her, providing for the both of them. By the time Leo was eight, he spent every spare minute at the shop, and could do math better than most adults, solving mechanical problems in his head. They would also have special Friday night dinners of shrimp and catfish from a local seafood restaurant in Houston.
  </p>
  <p key="ecb3bb87-41fa-451e-ac24-caf39aa52060">
   Leo had a cousin who bullied him, named Raphael, and a mean third grade teacher named Mr. Borquin. During Día de los Muertos, his Aunt Rosa took it seriously and dragged him to the local cemetery in Houston, where they would clean their relatives graves and leave offerings of lemonade, cookies, and marigolds. Rosa would force him to stay for the picnic, as if eating with dead people would fix his appetite.

   One night, when Leo was eight, Esperanza and Leo were working late at night. Esperanza was making a prototype, and if it succeeded, she would finally get a break. While they worked, Esperanza made corny jokes and said his father would be proud of him. After they were done, as they were walking through the break room, Esperanza realized that she left her keys in the warehouse and thought she had them, and smiled at Leo for the last time. A few seconds later, the door closed and locked. Leo ran to the door and yelled her name, and tried to open the door, then tapped with Morse code, "You okay?". But then a voice appeared, and said she couldn't hear him. A lady appeared, who turned out to be

   Leo thought she was Tía Callida, but she said she wasn't, just a family resemblance. He asked where his mom was, and she said that he will fight

Leo became angry and told her to leave his mother alone, and she asked how he will stop her. His hands caught fire and she smiled, knowing she had won. Leo fell into a rage and trying to save his mother and himself and tried to kill Gaea, but the fire killed his mother and burned her alive.

  <p key="4dd53535-6121-4d7f-a4f2-e8f297ec98fa">
   Leo woke up in an ambulance, and the paramedic was kind to him, saying that the warehouse had burned down and his mom hadn't made it out. Leo felt hollow, and realized he had lost control like his mom had warned him about. He thought her death was his fault. The police were not nice to him and said the fire started where Leo was standing, and he miraculously survived, but his mom didn't make it. The police wondered what kind of child would've started a fire. His neighbors in the apartment complex gossiped about him, saying they always knew something was wrong with him.

   His Aunt Rosa turned his entire family against him and called him "El Diablo" (meaning "the devil"), and shouted at social workers to take him away. Leo never forgave Rosa for that, and kept a grudge against her for the rest of his life. Rosa would forever be the person Leo hated most. His relatives wouldn't take him in, so he was sent to foster care. His first foster home only lasted for a few days, and he ran away a few days later.

   He would be at five more foster homes after that. Some foster homes would last longer than others and he would make friends, joking around, and pretended that nothing bothered him, but he always ran away sooner or later. At the foster homes he was at, he was frozen out and ignored, and treated him like they didn't need him. He even had an abusive foster mom, Teresa. From being in foster care, and in rough schools, he learned to tell when fights were going to get ugly. He would have nightmares and hug his pillow, which was embarrassing in the foster homes. Due to Leo growing up without a mom, he never had someone to tell him how to treat women and to not call them "mamacita".
  </p>
  <p key="02a781dd-965e-417d-976b-e00ea84e597a">
   Leo was bullied when he was younger by popular girls, who would make fun of him, gossiped a lot, and did everything to make his life miserable. He would tease bullies and mess with them to save himself.

While Leo was there, he was protected by

Leo hated being at the Wilderness school, likening it to a prison, and would have to run ten miles a day and be pushed to his limits. It also forced Leo to go on several forced marches. However, he liked to mess with Coach Hedge.

Leo compares the kids to himself, stating that they've never had much and he can at least show them that somebody cares. Leo is also pleased that some of them are excellent mechanics. Apollo questions if Leo wouldn't need a shop or tools, but Leo explains that he has

Apollo notices that Leo is clearly worried, clearly missing her and possibly having nightmares about all the hot clarinet player counselors that Calypso might be hanging out with.

   Leo is easygoing, mischievous, upbeat, energetic, eccentric, funny, flirty, and loves to tell jokes constantly, even if they aren't particularly funny. He is usually a troublemaker, as he gets in trouble constantly with Coach Hedge for tampering with his megaphone. Leo is genuinely very intelligent and honest and cares about his friends and family. He sometimes doesn't think before reacting and he enjoys pulling pranks on people, especially those who he doesn't like. Despite his jokey attitude, Leo is emotionally scarred from the death of his mother and is crushed by guilt as he indirectly caused her death. He later realizes that it wasn't him who had caused her death and opens up to his friends more and more. He hides a hurt and angry demeanor with humor. Leo has been shown to have a serious side, which happens when he is angered by someone or when the situation calls for it. He is also seen building small bits of machinery and equipment and is very skilled and serious about his work.

He is around 5'6, about two inches shorter than Piper McLean.

He was able to easily keep the upper hand against the snow goddess Khione for an extended period of time forcing her to go on the defensive, eventually forcing her to flee.

    Narcissus
    and seeing how absorbed he is in himself, as well as all the nymphs loving him for his looks, he realizes that Echo is the only one that truly loves him for him and wants to save him. Echo helps Leo in his plan to steal a metal shield Narcissus is using as a mirror and aids in Leo's escape. While running away, she plans to fight off the nymphs that are after them. Leo sees her true face for only a minute and offers to bring her with them, but she refuses as she still loves Narcissus.

However, they were still friendly and Leo teased Piper about her stealing a BMW. Leo also winked and shot her a finger fun at the campfire. As for Piper, she thought a Leo was annoying, like when they were on the way to

     Calais

He was excited when the mist memories were fake because he felt like it was a chance to reset their dynamic. But since Piper and Jason were heading to be a couple again, he thought they didn't want Leo around and he was worried being an odd man out again. He also felt like a reject when Piper and Jason got to see

     . Piper was very grateful when he saved her life and asked if he was okay, and Leo apologized for not telling her about the fire. But Piper grinned and punched his arm, saying it was amazing. Piper comforted Jason when Festus died. Leo also comforted Piper when he learned about her dad, and assured her that he will help her. Leo comforted Piper again when her father went home, giving her Kleenex, and Piper thought how much he meant to her.

     Leo and Piper later had a heartfelt conversation, with Leo comforting Piper about her dad.  He reassured her that he will be fine with Coach Hedge protecting him. Leo was secretly struck by how much Piper had changed and seemed more present in the moment. He thought about how she spent her entire semester at the wilderness School trying not to be seen, and now she was impossible to miss. Piper confided in Leo about how she was worried about Jason, and that he may be the enemy. Leo was worried too, but reassured her that he wouldn't betray them after all they had been through, and said they were a team. Leo also realized that Piper was scared of losing Jason after losing her father, and couldn't imagine how it was for her to see her dad break down. Leo reassured her that she was the strongest, most powerful beauty queen he ever met, and she could trust herself and him. Piper was impressed later when Leo showed her and Jason

Leo was not oblivious to her family stress and knew she was sensitive about both her godly and Cherokee sides of her family, though it was hard to keep track which made her more sensitive each day. The two and Jason cooperated well in defeating the
     Maenads

Leo also teased Piper and said she had power ranger pajamas, and Piper said they were Cherokee Eagles. When Leo went missing in the Atlantic Ocean, Piper didn't sleep that night and looked in visions in

She was originally mad at Hazel and Frank when they kept his plan from her, but she agreed that it was a plan Leo would've done.

However, when Jason and Piper started dating in the fake memories, Leo felt like he was not needed anymore and even though he was happy for them, he felt like a third wheel. When the two actually met, Leo thought that Jason was messing with him and faking his amnesia to get back at the last time he pranked him. But Jason knew that he never met him before and that his memories were fake. Leo tried to mess with Jason, saying that he does everything he says, does his chores, and gives him dessert, but Piper chastised him. Jason thought that Leo was weird, and told him that. He thought that if Leo was his best friend, his life must be very messed up. Jason tried to question Leo to see if they were really friends, and when Leo couldn't prove the details of when they met, Jason knew that he was right. Nevertheless, Jason was concerned about Leo's safety when he was attacked by

Jason smiled and let him go, saying that since their journey started together, it was right for him to come with them, and that if he can get him a ride, he can go. Leo was overjoyed and pumped his fist. Leo knew that he could help Jason as soon as he heard his vision, and knew the woman he saw was the same woman who he saw as Tía Callida. Leo ended up fixing

     to transport Jason and Piper on the quest. Jason was weirded out but amazed when he found out that Leo fixed Festus, and thought it was weird that he named it Happy the dragon, but was ready to accompany him.
Leo and Jason bonded over the course of the quest when Leo saved Jason from
     Ma Gasket
     and the other cyclops, and trusted Jason enough to tell him about Tía Callida, still considering Jason his friend. Jason was very impressed with Leo when he saved him from the cyclops with one tool kit, thinking it wasn't bad. In return, Leo was also grateful for Jason when he was willing to fight Calais and Zethes to save him. In Chicago, Leo even confided in Jason, telling him about his fire powers and his mother's  death. Jason was very Impressed by his cooking and his fire powers, and when Leo said he didn't want to tell him because he didn't want to look like a freak, he reassured him that he was just as a freak as he and Piper were. He also reassured him what happened to his mom wasn't his fault.

Leo revealed that he thought Jason was always the star, who took everything for granted, and Jason said that Leo was annoying, who cannot take anything seriously or even fix a dragon. Piper managed to snap the two out of it and save them from killing each other. After the incident, Leo and Jason both felt horrible about how Medea turned them against each other, and Leo felt bad about how he did secretly resent Jason for the things he told him. Leo was upset about what Jason told him, even the next day, made worse by the fact that Festus broke for good. Jason tried to apologize, and said what happened wasn't Leo's fault and reassured him that he was amazing, but Leo brushed it off, still upset by his failure. Jason finally apologized in Omaha, saying he didn't mean anything he said and that he wished he could do half of the things Leo could do. He said that Leo did take things seriously and that he wasn't annoying. Leo accepted his apology, and joked that he can't resent him if he apologizes, and that he is supposed to. He told him that he is annoying and to not insult his ability to annoy. This eased the tension between the two.

For once, Leo didn't feel jealous of Jason and actually sympathized with him, knowing that he was lucky to know his mom while Jason didn't, finding himself saying "Love You" in Morse code on his knee. Later, when they went to Aeolus's palace, Leo went to comfort Jason while they walked, and Jason expressed his jealousy towards Thalia of having all the demigod stuff together. Jason even confided in him, saying he wondered if what happened with his mom was his fault. Leo supported him, saying that it takes awhile to get used to demigod stuff and that what happened with his mom wasn't his fault.

But this didn't affect his friendship with Jason at all and didn't resent him for it. Leo was ecstatic after he returned from Salt Lake City to find Jason awake, and greeted him, saying he was glad he was better.

However, after meeting Calypso, Leo felt a surge of anger towards Percy, and was mad at him for hurting Calypso. To make things worse, since Calypso clearly still had feelings for Percy, which made things ten times worse for Leo. Ultimately, however, Leo is the one to save Percy and Annabeth by flinging a screwdriver at the
     Doors of Death
     , managing to save them just in time. Leo was very happy when Percy survived Tartarus and whooped in happiness.

Percy intimidated him before, but now he was even more intimidating after being in the pit. He had trouble thinking of him as from the same Camp, since they never were at

The two skipped stones, and when Percy caught the rock Leo skipped, Leo wanted to show off by blowing up a tour bus with fire. Percy became uncomfortable when Leo angrily stared at him, and after Leo apologized, Percy suggested that they should talk, and Leo agreed. But they began to bond when Percy made a joke about saying Adidas was the best to Nike, and Leo realized that they had another thing in common: their same stupid sense of humor. Leo and Percy also teamed up to defeat Nike. While fighting her, they finally discussed Calypso. Percy said if they didn't make it out, he wanted him to know that he felt bad about Calypso, and felt like he failed her. Percy said even though he lost his memory and went on the quest, he should have made sure the gods freed her. He said he was glad Leo found her and promised that he would do anything to help Leo after they make it out. Leo then asked what his problem was, and said he was just as bad as Jason: he couldn't resent him for being all hero-y. He wondered how he could hate him after he apologized and promised to help. Percy smiled and apologized. Leo finally had no resentment towards Percy, and his anger began to unravel, now that he knew he had no feelings towards Calypso. He just couldn't dislike him after he apologized and acted all nice and sincere.

Leo became sarcastic and joking with Percy, calling him "Water Boy", which he told him not to call him, then calling him "Aquaman", which he hated more. Leo was also miffed and asked him why he had to destroy the plumbing when he did. Percy also joked that if a statue engulfed people in fire, he should send Leo, and Leo jokingly said he loved him too. Leo was also grateful when Percy got everyone in the crew, including him, gelato, and said that it made his whole day better. Leo also joked about how Percy's zodiac sign was Leo's name. However, Leo kept his suicidal plan to sacrifice himself from Percy. Percy was devastated when Leo died, and was initially angry at Hazel and Frank, but his anger subsided when they cried and agreed that it was a plan Leo would've done. Percy was hopeful that Leo was alive and said that if he lives, they can take turns strangling him.

Out of all the demigods, Nico the only one not mad at Hazel and Frank for what they did, because he knew what Leo did was a sneaky, twisted, ridiculously annoying and noble plan he would do. Nico knew better that Leo was dead, telling Jason so, and said that he felt his death. However, Nico was wracked with guilt of his death and replayed the scene of his death in his mind for two days after it happened, and wondered if what he did unnecessarily cost him his life. His death even led him to pray to his father for guidance for the first time. Even though Nico felt guilty himself of what happened, he reassured Jason and Hazel that it wasn't their fault. Nico also sensed that there seemed to be something different about Leo's death, possibly sensing that Leo had in fact been resurrected but not understanding it.

One of such is when Leo asked Frank why he didn't always turn into a dragon, since it was such a useful form to take the shape of. Frank replied, saying it was because shapeshifting is hard, like lifting weights. Leo said he wouldn't know, since he didn't lift weights, to which Frank began to respond, telling him he should consider trying it out. Shortly after, Hazel stepped in to cut off the argument. Frank also got angry at Leo when he didn't want to rescue Nico, taking it as a sign that Leo was skeptical of both Hazel and Nico's loyalty. In Atlanta, Leo embarrassed Frank when he teased him for not figuring out Chinese handcuffs, and he said he was worth at least two or three Franks when he and other members of the Argo II were wondering how much each of them would be worth. Annabeth later reassured Frank that Leo was nervous around him, and he was a good guy. Hazel also told Leo that Frank was nervous around him due to his fireballs, since Frank's main weakness is fire, due to his fragile lifeline depending on a piece of firewood.

Frank was amazed how Leo's tension with Hazel had disappeared. Frank was relieved that Leo wasn't hitting on her, but he was worried about him, even after their differences, and after all they'd been through, he didn't want his heart broken. Leo later asked Frank for his firewood, and though Frank was reluctant, he gave it to him, and trusted Leo. Leo ended up making a fireproof bag for Frank's firewood, and Leo wanted to light it to test it. Even though Frank was skeptical, he realized he trusted Leo after he saved him in Rome. The bag ended up being fireproof, and Frank was grateful to Leo and thanked him, even though it seemed inadequate after what he had done for him. Leo accepted it and said he was his best buddy. Later, Leo told Hazel he was happy for her and Frank, and hoped they would be happy. Leo also said Frank had moves and would be alright. Leo was happy that Frank was promoted to

Leo couldn't believe how much Frank had changed in the last few weeks, and thought he was more confident and more willing to take charge. He could barely see him as the the klutzy dude who couldn't get out of Chinese handcuffs just a few weeks ago. Leo and Frank went with Percy and Hazel to defeat

Frank choked up, and Leo said he was counting on him, and that since his father told him to step up, he would have to make the call other people aren't willing to make. Frank cried and hugged both Leo and Hazel, which Leo was weirded out by. Leo asked if he was in agreement, and Frank said he hated the plan, but he would do it. The next day, Frank gave Leo the
     Pylosian Mint
     and told him not to break it. Leo joked about how not breaking deadly poison would've never occurred to him, and Frank told him to shut up and gave him a hug, telling him to be careful. Frank kept Leo's plan from the others at his insistence. After Leo died, Frank was devastated and cried, tearfully telling the others. They were all mad at Frank until they couldn't be mad at him while he was crying, and they agreed that was a plan Leo would've done.

After looking at Hazel's past, the memories showed a moment where an old Sammy was talking to a baby Leo.

Leo however feels that he is only an imitation of Sammy after seeing Sammy's quick wit and how charming he was with the girls, unlike himself.
