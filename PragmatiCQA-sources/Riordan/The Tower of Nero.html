   who are planting squash. His underlying goal of these rounds is to see if there is any possibility of not executing Lu's plan. Apollo first talks with
   Sherman Yang
   from the
   Ares' Cabin
   who tells him a frontal attack would be suicide. Sherman also says he doubts there would be any secret entrances and that if there were, they would be riddled with all sorts of traps. Apollo then asks if there would be some sort of doomsday device that has

   Malcolm
   tells Apollo he can get this information for him... however it would take four weeks. With this, Apollo exits the Athena Cabin in tears. At lunch time, Apollo decides to talk to the

When Apollo offers to take the arrow up into the grove he is met with resistance. The arrow does not want to return to its roots because it believes it is now an outcast among its family. Apollo promises he will bring the arrow back to the grove once his journey has finally ended. The arrow goes silent and tells Apollo he should go speak to Meg.

Meg talks about how her day went and Apollo is happy, noting how excited she is to be at Camp Half Blood. He begins to say that he could go to the Tower of Nero alone so she could stay but she stops him. Meg asks if it's because he doesn't trust her to which he says this is not the case. She reflects on the time she betrayed him at the very start of his journey back to godhood. Apollo says how much they've both changed since then. Meg then states she wants to go in order to prove that she's strong. However, she wonders if she would relapse and revert back to the person she was. Apollo feels this statement internally and wonders when he returns to godhood if he will remember what it was like to be human or if he will slip back into his old selfish ways. Apollo admits that he is worried for both of their futures and Meg says they have to try. With this Apollo agrees that they should both go into the Tower together. When he returns back to the Apollo Cabin, he makes sure to restock on supplies for the journey ahead. As he is preparing,
   Austin
   and
   Kayla
   tell him they will be waiting on standby in case he needs help. Apollo enjoys the night before his journey at the campfire where he feels at ease. At dawn, Will wakes Apollo and informs him that he and Nico have returned from gathering supplies. He and Will then join Nico and Meg at the side of the road as they board the shuttle bus to go meet Rachel.

She explains that every time Apollo and Meg freed an oracle, she would get quick glimpses of what was happening.

Rachel tells everyone that she is pretty sure she knows where Neros's tower is located, right in the middle of the building. This room has no windows and can only be accessed by a special elevator. All the doors are reinforced by celestial bronze. Meg notes that while she was under Nero's care, this was the floor they were never allowed to go into. Rachel points to the blueprints again and shows a vault that she thinks contains the fasces and shows the room next to this. She assumes the room next to it is the one that holds prisoners. Apollo realizes that this means Lu was right and the only way to get close to it is to turn himself in and get captured. Rachel then says this would not be very easy since she was having visions of some sort of guardian. She says that she was sure Python himself was trying to make sure she could see this. Apollo then asks if the guardian was a creature with a lion's head and snakes slithering around its body. He can't remember how he knows this but he's sure it correlates with the line in the prophecy that talks about "a lion, snake-entwined". Nico questions this possible plan the possible outcomes of both choices. Nico asks about the possible doomsday switch and how this would take place. Rachel mentions some plans she's gotten and how something deep underground can pump out Greek Fire. They conclude that if the city goes up in flame, Nero and the rest of his followers will be safe since the building will have some sort of protection. Nico once again brings up his plan of doing damage using his friends underground. Nico finally reveals that these "friends" are troglodytes. Apollo is not convinced they are real at first but accepts it as this might be their only hope. Rachel insists on going with them as a line in the prophecy refers to her, "A Dare reveals the path that was unknown". Rachel furthers this point by saying she has clear sight and is able to see things the others are unable to.
Rachel suddenly stops talking and Apollo is joyed thinking the Oracle was trying to speak through her and give them advice. However the smoke that came out of her mouth was yellow instead of the usual green and the voice of

   Meg and Apollo can't harm the first bull despite their efforts and a second bull breaks free from the pack to come and attack them as well. Meg says they should split up and rushes to take the second cow, leaving Apollo to deal with the first. Apollo catches his bull in a tarp while Meg is in a game of tag with her bull. More cows start to fall into the pit so as a last ditch effort Apollo tells Meg they need to get to the ladder. This plan is foiled since the first cow from earlier is blocking the path. Apollo brings out his ukulele and plays a song in an attempt to distract the cow so Meg can get around it, however this fails. He gets to Meg and is just about to sacrifice himself for her safety until Nico shows up and shadow travels them both away.

   Nico brings Apollo and Meg to Will and Rachel, who were in the sewers, before instantly going to sleep. Will gives everyone Kit Kat bars, claiming it was the "best thing for recovering from shadow-travel". While discussing what to do next, Will fails in describing the troglodytes. Rachel claims that

Will glows, amazing Apollo, Meg, and Rachel. After that, Nico calls up the troglodytes. Dressed in various outfits, one who was dressed like George Washington, greets Nico and mistakes the others as a sacrifice. Nico corrects him, giving him the five-lined skink, and giving his name as

   Nico proposes a pact between the two groups, and Screech-Bling agrees to hear him out, taking them all to the troglodyte corporate headquarters. Screech-Bling takes the gang to a tent with a cold fire. Rachel continues to check her watch that displays the time as 4:30. Apollo realizes this means that it would soon be time for him and Meg to turn themselves into Nero. After a while a troglodyte appears to take Nico to chat with Screech Bling. While they wait for them to return, Rachel tells Apollo that after he turns himself in the first thing he should do is try and buy time. Apollo asks what he could do to buy time to which Rachel doesn't answer. What she does tell him is that during the time he and Meg surrender, Camp Half-Blood could be preparing an attack. This could be what Nero wants since he would love the chance to destroy all of the campers. This is the only way as a bluff wouldn't work as long as Python is in charge of the Oracle. Rachel is impressed since the old Apollo would not care about the lives of other people. This restarts Apollo's inner conflict of his human side and how it would change when he regained his godhood. Apollo decides to go with the plan and the messenger comes to collect the rest of the gang.

   Dinner is served then the discussion for plans starts. Screech-Bling tells the other troglodytes the plan Nico and the rest of the group suggested. The other troglodytes aren't on board right away as they don't see the point in saving the humans as long as they would be safe. The gang mentions that their food supply and hat shops would burn up but they are not yet swayed. Apollo realizes that appealing to their self-interests would not work. Apollo stands up and gives a speech about civilized people and what that means. He plays a song on his ukulele about his travels from the beginning to now. When he was finished, Screech-Bling tells him this was the most horrible thing he's ever heard and asks if the words were true. Rachel talks about the state of the future and this seals the deal with Screech-Bling asking what he can do to help. Apollo asks him to take Nico, Will, and Rachel into the underground tunnels while he and Meg turn themselves in.

   Apollo loses track of Will, Nico, and Rachel as a bull lands right in front of him. The same bull splits him up from Meg and Grr-Fred. He struggles to catch up as Grr-Fred drags Meg away towards a river. Apollo dodges more bulls until he sees one cornering a toddler. He decides to distract this bull so the toddler could run away, however this now makes him the new target. Meg tells Apollo they need to go and all three of them jump into the river to slow down the bulls. Eventually they come to a ledge but they don't have time to rest as the bulls could be coming any minute. He gives them each a piece of jerky to get their energy back up before they keep moving. While they're eating, Grr-Fred works on building a passage they can go through. He seals the tunnel to keep the tauri off of their scents for a while. Grr-Fred guides them to a passage that opens up in a subway station. This will put them 50 feet from Nero's tower. After Grr-Fred turns to return to the rest of the trogs, Meg and Apollo take the staircase up to the surface.

   When they are first approaching the tower, Apollo is surprised that there is no guards coming to get them. They go inside and the secretary asks both of them for some form of ID. Apollo hands over his New York drivers license and Meg hands over her golden scimitars. They're directed to the elevators and brace themselves for what is going to happen when they reach the top.

   A dryad greets them at the top and takes them into the room Nero is in. In the room with Nero are the 11 imperial children, a handful of servers, half a dozen Germani, and Luguselwa who still looks damaged from their previous encounter. Nero thanks their guide and Apollo realizes that he's enslaving dryads as a power move. After Lu talks about how they gave themselves up like she said they would, Nero starts to question Apollo. He says he believes Meg would, but he doesn't get why Apollo would. Nero then goes on a rant on good acts and traditional Roman values. Apollo wonders where he's going with this monologue until he mentions bad acts. He suspects Apollo's surrender falls under one of these bad acts.

   Gunther

Nero uses this betrayal as a threat against the other 11 children in case they ever thought of doing the same thing. Nero then says he knows what the plan would have been including Camp Half Blood marching on the tower. Apollo's facial expressions give away that he guessed correctly. Nero calls one of the children,
   Cassius
   , out of line and tells him and go collect Meg's rings. This seems to put her in distress as she cries, calling him by a nickname and telling him not to do this. Nero instructs the boy to take the scimitars and chop off Lu's hands.

While all of Apollo's weapons were taken, he was left with his ukulele and healing supplies. He puts her to sleep with a chloroform sheet as he prepares himself for the next steps. His first thought is to cauterize the wound but wonders where he would get the fire. Suddenly some of his godly power returns to him as his hand bursts into flames.

Jason tells him it's okay, that he made the choice, and that Apollo doesn't owe him anything, he just wants him to remember what he told him before he died. Jason tells him that he wouldn't be much a hero if he wasn't ready to risk everything for the greater cause. Apollo realizes that it would be selfish to bring Jason back to life realizing since it would be for himself and easing his grief. Apollo's guilt starts to loosen a bit as he tells Jason that everyone misses him. Jason says he misses everyone too and warns him to beware of
   Mithras
   's servant, the lion and snake entwined. He says Apollo knows what it is and what to do and that there is a price for bargaining with the guardian of the stars; sometimes you have to pay the price and sometimes you have to let other people do it. Jason then dissolves and Apollo wakes up. Lu is awake and she asks about Meg. Apollo says he is not sure and soon after Gunther returns with sandwiches and informs them, they are to be tortured later that night. Apollo and Lu quickly realize that there are too many security measures for them to break out without getting recaptured. While he goes back to sit down, he wonders how Meg is doing now that she's back in Nero's care. Lu senses that he's worrying about her and tells him that him that they will get her back.

   Apollo asks about the security mikes in the cell and if Nero and crew could hear them talking about right now. Lu tells them that unless security mikes were installed in the last twenty-four hours this conversation would be between them. Apollo tells her that the "other plan" is still set in motion and is hopefully going on as long as Will, Nico, and Rachel are still safe. He tells her about the other "other plan" for the emperor's fasces and how Jason told him about the protector of it. Lu gives him the backstory of the protector and how Nero came to recruit it. Lu tells him they need to find out more info about the Mithras's creature as well as Meg's wellbeing. This is subtly telling him that he should enter the dreamscape to figure out info on both. Apollo chooses to control his dreams in order to get the information they need.

Python attempts to talk to him, but Apollo quickly shifts the dream to elsewhere. Apollo finally finds Meg and sees her throwing a tantrum with a Germani watching her, trying to get her to pick out a dress. Meg is getting ready to throw a lamp when Nero suddenly enters the room. He tells Meg to sit with him and when she takes a seat across the room, he tries to guilt her into thinking this whole predicament was her fault. This upsets Meg and she returns to her tantrum. Nero tells her that she led Apollo here and is the reason Lu got her hands cut off. This throws her off a bit as he tells her that she should punish Cassius for what he did to Lu. Meg finally goes to sit next to Nero where he continues to manipulate her against Apollo. Apollo's emotions get the best of him and he loses control of these dream, falling into the next one.

Apollo takes advantage of this and punches the guy closet to him in the face with his bow. Another germani shoots at him with a gun from across the room but ends up temporarily deafening everyone in the room. Apollo draws his bow and arrows and takes out the germani who shot at him in the first place. The technicians turn back to the control panel and the other Germani charge Apollo. He trips but he manages to get one shot off at the technician. He hobbles the leader of this team and rushes to the control panels. He fires a warning shot to the Germani slowly closing in on him and urges the technicians to leave. They don't heed this warning because they're more afraid of the Germani. The technicians go back to their jobs while the Germani attempt to surround Apollo again. He manages to take a few out but two still remain. He fires two more shots and takes them out but this victory is short lived as he gets hit on the back of his head by the Leader of the Germani who pins him at sword point. The technicians are still trying to get the machine working but Apollo realizes that the other team must have succeeded at sabotaging it.

Apollo's head injury is still making him act funny but he tries to fill Nico in on what had happened before he rescued him from the Germani. He tells Nico he needs to get to the southeast corner of the residence to find Meg. Nico tells him he knows this location and that they're three floors too low and it would be difficult to get there through all the fighting. Apollo sees what he means by this when they get to the end of the hallway and are surrounded by all sorts of battles. Nico leads Apollo to the Camp Half-Blood landing zone where the campers had set up command.

Austin tells him that this elevator leads directly into the imperial apartments but they would need a key card to use it. Both of them are discussing what they should do next when the elevator suddenly opens. Cassius, the demigod who cut off Lu's hands, is on it and looks very upset.

Apollo notices a laptop on the nightstand with Nero's face on a live video call. Nero jiggles the camera and Apollo asks where Meg is. Nero tells him that she's in the throne room with him. Apollo tells Nero that he'll kill him when he gets the chance however Nero is not fazed and finds the threat funny. Screech-Bling shows up in the doorway but Apollo gives him a subtle shake of the head to tell him to not get any closer. When he tunes back in to what Nero is saying he catches him mentioning Sassanid gas. Apollo doesn't know what this is but Screech-Bling reacts to the mention of this gas. Nero tells him that is an extremely lethal gas is even more effective in enclosed spaces......such as buildings.

He gives him 15 minutes to come up to the throne room alone before he releases the gas. He tells him that if he doesn't come he'll release the gas now and kill everyone inside. With that Nero turns off the call and Apollo turns to Screech-Bling. Screech-Bling tells him that the gas is bad and that Rachel was having visions again and told him to go to that room. Screech-Bling tells him that he will gather some other trogs and try to disable the gas before it goes off and leaves the room to do this task. Apollo realizes how bleak things are when he remembers he can't kill Nero unless Lu had succeeded However, he doesn't have much of a choice since he needs to stall Nero and find Meg.

He scans the room and notices that Meg wasn't there and Nero had a dozen bodyguards surrounding him. He sees that only 7 imperial children are in the room and they're each holding a torch over a dryad pot. Apollo asks where Meg is and Nero tells him she's somewhere around here and he should put his weapons on the floor. Apollo puts down his bow and arrow and later his ukulele and backpack on the floor. He realizes there's no hope in even trying to attack as long as Nero is still invincible. Nero then calls Meg forward and she comes out from behind one of the columns. He instantly notices that she looks different. She has a new haircut and a new dress with the only familiar thing about her being her glasses. Apollo notes that she looks elegant, older, and beautiful, like a proper lady of the Imperial Household. Meg locks eyes with Apollo and hesitates when Nero asks her to come sit next to him. Nero asks a germanus to bring him a remote control. Apollo realizes that this is the remote that would make the gas spray into the rest of the building.

   Apollo reminds him that he said Meg would choose the outcome of this situation. Meg is clearly surprised by this and Nero takes this moment to start manipulating the situation. He says that Apollo is a user and has ruined many lives. Nero paints himself as the complete opposite and says all he does is give back to people. He then reminds Apollo of all the people who have died for him including Jason Grace. He also lists off some of the deaths from Camp Jupiter and how they all died because Apollo wanted to become a god again. Apollo makes the mistake of calling the Imperial Children "poor children" in his rebuttal and allows Nero to find another way to slander him. He starts telling Apollo about all the children he's mistreated but he tunes him out as he wonders where Screech-Bling is. When he tunes back in Nero is still talking and is discussing all the children down below, risking their lives on Apollo's behalf. He places the gas remote on the chair right next to him. Meg is still torn and is unable to choose what to do next. Nero uses this as an opportunity to use the name of Daphne and the lives of other dryads he's ruined to rile up the dryads in the room. They all turn and attack.

   Apollo can tell that the dryads hearts aren't in the fight. He dodges two of them and tells them he won't fight them. One of the dryads hesitates and as a result gets lit on fire by her demigod keeper. This kills her and she turns in a pile of ash. This upsets Meg and the idea of the dryads attacking Apollo upsets her even further. The dryads continue to attack Apollo and one of them locks him in a chokehold. This finally pushes Meg over the edge and she orders the dryads to stop. She runs over the Apollo and checks him over for injuries. She asks him if Lu is still alive and Apollo tells her she's still fighting. Apollo then tells Meg that she's the only person in the room that she needs to listen to. Apollo gives Meg her golden rings back and reminds her that she's stronger than Nero.

   Nero tries to regain control of the situation by telling Meg that they can't interfere with justice, to which Meg shouts at him telling him that this isn't justice. Nero looks at her with pity and tells her that the dryads didn't have the courage or spirit to do what's necessary. Meg watches in horror as she realizes what this means and Nero informs the other Imperial Children to drop their torches into the dryad's pots. Meg explodes with some kind of green dust that coats everyone and everything in the throne room, as puts the flames from the torches out. This dust allows the dryads plants to become even stronger and tells them to go heal while she protects them.

   Nero recovers and tells Meg she needs to control herself. Meg tries to get a word in but Nero cuts her off telling her he can keep Apollo alive if that's what she truly wants and she just needs to be his daughter again. Meg remains in her spot and Nero tells her that everything becomes much harder when she wakes The Beast. He tells her that she and Apollo are both outnumbered and couldn't take down everyone in the room. Meg tells Nero that she didn't kill her father or cut off Lu's hands. That was all Nero's doing and for that she hates him. Nero's next attempts at manipulating her don't work and she tells him that she's not listening to him anymore and she won't use his weapons to fight anymore. With this she throws her golden rings on the floor. Nero tells her that this is foolish and is about to give his crew the signal to start fighting until a BOOM shakes the chamber. Through all the rubble and dust Apollo can see Nico di Angelo commanding a bull.

  <p key="2fdf46d8-30ae-47b4-ae3f-03960a62e976">
   Nero and the rest of his crew are as caught off guard as Apollo and Meg are. Apollo notes that Nico looks even worse than he did after their last encounter. Nico instructs the bull to go attack Nero and everything turns into chaos in Nero's ranks. Nero figures out that the remote he was given earlier was the wrong one and was not releasing gas. He instructs the germani to bring him the rest of the remotes so he can look for the right one. Meg tells Apollo to get up and drags him out of the way of one of the creatures in front of him. Nico appears in front of him and takes care of the creature and says that Rachel sent him. They have no time to talk as another creature appears in front of them and Nico moves to take care of it. Apollo scans the room and sees Nero still looking for the remote, the Germani dogpillng the skeleteon bull, and three of the imperial children staring down Meg. Apollo asks about the gas and Nico tells him the trogs are still working on it. Meg overhears this conversation and asks if Camp Half-Blood has evacuated yet and Nico replies that they have not any didn’t want to leave unless Meg and Apollo had. Nico tells them to go and Apollo rushes towards the front so he can grab his weapons and defend himself in battle.

   Apollo asks Meg what she's going to use as a weapon and Meg tells him not to worry about it. Nico is still fighting with the wolf from earlier and the skeleton bull he brought to life had finally collapsed. The germani spills the tray with the rest of the remotes Nero needs to try. As Apollo aims for Nero's chest, one of the three missing Imperial Children stabs him in the ribs. As Apollo struggles to breathe he sees Meg across the room fighting barehanded with Aemillia and another one of the missing demigods. The demigod who stabbed Apollo pushes the knife even deeper. Apollo can't shake the demigod because he's too strong and as a desperate attempt shoves his thumb into his eyes and breaks free. He doesn't have the strength to aim another arrow and slips on his own blood.

  <p key="b6f943bd-81b9-4bda-b1df-dbc5fc4f7ba8">
   In his haze of agony, he sees Nero smiling and holding up a remote. Apollo can't stop the emperor, Meg is too far away, the bull was now a pile of bones, and Nico was busy holding off other monsters. Powerless to do anything, Apollo watches as Nero presses the button.

   Nothing happens. Nero curses and starts going through the cushions looking for the correct remote. Across the room, Meg disarms Aemillia and uses the borrowed sword to fend off the rest of her siblings. Nico is holding off the germani but Apollo can tell he's starting to get tired. It doesn't help that the leader of the germani is ordering them to surround and kill Nico. Apollo's side injury is preventing him from fighting at his full strength, but he attempts to hold his own for a while. Apollo sees Nero still looking for the remote and shoots an arrow at his chest. This doesn't work since Nero has some sort of protection shield on his toga. He nocks another arrow and this time aims it at Nero's head. This doesn't work either and Apollo realizes that he's still invincible.

   Apollo decides to take a new route of action and tries to shoot the remotes out of Nero's hands. This succeeds the first time but he is too slow the second attempt. He presses another remote but this one turns on three TVs. Apollo scans the room to see how his friends are doing and sees Meg being outnumbered by her siblings with Nico loosing steam. Apollo can't help because he only has one arrow left minus the Arrow of Dodona. Nero grabs another incorrect remote and is left with just one more remote.

  <p key="5697a5db-1cc5-4be3-ac0c-f72298f40c02">
   Apollo gets Nico's attention and uses his last arrow to shoot at the barbarian between Nico and Nero. Nico uses this opening to attack Nero with his remaining strength. Nero grabs his sword midair and tosses it across the room. Nico lunges for his throat but gets backhanded with so much force that he flies twenty feet into the nearest pillar. Nero reminds them all that he can't be killed since he is immortal and presses the button on the last remote. Meg tries to escape the circle but is tripped and falls face first. They failed, the entire camp was wiped out. The germani bring Nico to his feet and drag him to the throne, while the rest of the imperial family point their weapons at Meg. Nero is overjoyed and tells the guards to kill Apollo. They start approaching him and Apollo starts thinking of ways to defend himself until he hears a familiar voice behind him.

   Will walks in with Lu and Rachel will the Oracle holding Nero’s
   fasces
   Will declares that no one hits his boyfriend or kills his father. The guards start to attack but Nero tells everyone to freeze. The imperial children were just about to kill Meg before they got the orders to stand down. Will takes this chance to stride to the front of the room and gets Nico to his feet. He takes him back to the entrance with no interference. Nero backs up into the dais behind him and stares at Rachel with the fasces in his hand, calling her the Pythia. He tells them they should all be dead and Screech-Bling comes in the room and says that gas traps are finicky especially the detonators. Nero says Lu couldn't have defeated the leontocephaline and Lu said she didn't. She traded what the guardian needed, immortality.
  </p>
  <p key="480428db-a497-4298-9481-58fa53dff267">
   Nero starts to say that she doesn't have immortality until a look of dread passes over his face. Apollo starts to laugh and says that Lu has immortality because Nero does and that the two of them had been connected for centuries. Nero says that was his eternal life and she can't trade his life for his life. Lu agrees that this is a little shady but the leontocephaline had found it amusing. Nero asks if she would really kill herself to kill him and she says she would in a heartbeat. She continues and says now everyone is free of his bondage and they would see how long he would last. Nero laughs while claiming that they still can't destroy his fasces without destroying themselves in the process and that all the power would just transfer to Python, but Apollo can still hear the terror in his voice. Nero then tried to appeal to Rachel and says that he can convince Python to restore her powers and that he'll destroy the future of their kind. Rachel shrugs and says he's already chosen his kind and it wasn't humanity. Nero tries to appeal to Meg next and says that he'll let her choose. Meg is still surrounded by the other children and tells them everything they've done until now wasn't their faults and how they had the choice to drop their weapons and stand up to him. Nero tries to manipulate her with The Beast, but she just says that The Beast is dead and that she's killed it. She tells him to stand down and he would just be put in a prison even if it was nicer than he deserved. Lu says this is the best he was gonna get and Nero is visibly struggling with dealing the fact that his plan has been torn to shreds like this. He orders the remaining guards to kill them all.

   Apollo turns and runs, stumbling into Lu. He sees Will tending to Nico's wounds while Screech-Bling summons more troglodytes into the room who take on the emperor's forces. Apollo asks Rachel to give him the fasces and Lu asks if can even wield it without killing himself. Apollo says that he is not and Rachel joins the conversation saying she can't see the outcome but he needs to try. Apollo grabs the fasces and instantly feels the side effects from carrying something so powerful. Lu tells the ladies to cover him as he tries to figure out a way to destroy the fasces. He sees Meg trying to help her siblings fight the emperor's forces and Apollo picks up the pace for her sake. Apollo tries to pry to fasces apart to no avail and Rachel tells him he needs to hurry up. Apollo tries to break the fasces over his knee next but this only manages to nearly break his knee. Nero finally loses his cool and marches towards Apollo, intending to kill him. Nero starts glowing as he knocks most of the Trogs aside making Apollo's line of defense shrink leaving only Lu and Rachel. Apollo remembers all of Nero's attempts to godhood and it makes him realize he can't destroy the fasces without a little godly help.

   He yells at Lu and Rachel to run and get out of the way. As they move Nero finally ends up right in front of him. Apollo himself begins glow and the fasces begins to superheat. Nero and Apollo then start a game of tug-of-war with the ax and the glow continues to get brighter. Nero tries to taunt him saying Lester can't take the ax from him. In response, he declares He is Apollo, God of the Sun, and he revokes his divinity. With this the fasces breaks in two and a wave of emotions floods over Apollo. Nero hurtles backwards, landing on the carpet with burns. Apollo's glow starts to fade noting that he was unharmed. The fasces was now broken but Nero was still alive, albeit mortally burned. The emperor sobs in despair and asks Apollo what he's done. He then starts to crumble with a glittery cloud coming out of his nose and mouth. The glitter doesn't vanish and simply pours downwards into the cracks of the floor tiles as if he was being dragged back into the depths. With his last words he tells Apollo that he's given Python victory. Everyone in the room turns to look at Apollo with Lu asking if it's over. Rachel replies that it's not even close to being over yet. Apollo knows she's right and realizes the real threat but before he can even do anything he topples over and passes out in Rachel's arms.

He says that he has no choice and asks for nectar and more supplies. Rachel confirms this and says that Python is getting stronger by the second. The gang lets this information sink in and they go scrounge up some supplies for Apollo. Will gives his dad Mountain Dew and some more healing supplies. He hands a jar of healing salve to Meg and asks her to do the honors while he goes to look for more bandages. Meg starts to rubs the ointment on Apollo's wounds and Apollo glances her over noticing that she put a Camp Half-Blood shirt over her dress making her allegiance clear. Apollo says that he's proud of her, that she's and she said she had to be for her siblings.

Python tells him that he hasn't quite finished digesting Nero's power yet but it will have to do for now. Apollo nocks another arrow but Python doesn't seem intimidated by him. He lets the arrow fly and hits Python in the face but this has no effect. Python continues to taunt him saying that he's merely just cut the middlemen and he still has control of Delphi. Apollo doesn't let him finish and shoots another arrow at his throat, this time making him gag. Python shifts forms and prepares to destroy Apollo until he hears a message from Delphi.

He continues to squeeze, breaking his ribs. Apollo tries to fight but Python just continues strangling him. The Arrow starts to speak to him, saying it is time for Python's prophecy to come to pass. It tells Apollo that if he fails he will fail, but first he should use it. It points itself towards Python's face and Apollo understands what it's trying to say.

He gets an idea and yells Python's name. Python says that he will not live and Apollo says he's fine with that as long as Python dies too.

   The two fight each other still as they fumble downwards into the River Styx. The river saps Apollo's memories and starts to pry open the cracks in Lester. Apollo keeps Python trapped in the Styx knowing he would be much more dangerous on land. The wrath of the Styx continues to sap his strength until he remembers his promise to Meg. Python and Apollo tumble to the edge of the waterfall and fall again into Tartarus. They fell even further and Apollo realizes they're standing on the brink of chaos. He notices that his human form is starting to burn away leaving only the marbled lines of a glowing light, the center of his chest swirling with a purple tint.

Styx isn't done talking yet and asks Apollo if he has learned yet. He does and he expects no mercy. Styx smiles and tells him to hold onto that, but he wonders if she means the rock or the lesson. She tells him that's up to him to decide and dissolved into smoke leaving Apollo alone. He's comforted knowing that at least he erased Python from existence and that he would never existence again. Just when he starts to wonder what the point of holding on is, he remembers his promise to Meg. He realizes this is the lesson Styx was trying to teach him and that it doesn't matter how loud your oath is, what truly matter is if you meant it. With this his arms become more substantial and his body becoming more real as light weaves his body together until his form was a mesh of golden light.

   When he wakes up, he sees Artemis leaning over him. He cries and gives his sister a hug. Artemis comforts him and says everything's alright, he made it. After they break the hug, Apollo looks at himself seeing all his scars and bruises from his last fight were gone. He asks Artemis how long he was out for, and she tells him that only two weeks had passed. He then asks about his friends and Artemis reassures him that she sent them all clear omens of his success. Artemis helps Apollo change clothes and they prepare to go to the throne room. Apollo asks for a moment alone as he tries to gather his thoughts. He takes off the laurel wreath on his head since he feels like he does not deserve it. All these visual reminders of all the things he's done in these past few centuries causes him to feel uneasy, but he says this uneasiness also feels reassuring. As he continues thinking he realizes he doesn't see Mount Olympus as a home anymore and wants to see Meg again as well as being with Camp Half-Blood and Camp Jupiter again. But he realizes the world of demigods isn't his place but that doesn't mean he can't remember his experiences there. This doesn't mean he can't go and visit though but before this he has to show himself to his family. He turns and walks to the throne room.

   Apollo describes the throne room and how strange it looks to him now. While thinking about all this he realizes that all the discussions had stopped when he entered with everyone turning to look at him. Apollo remembers how to enlarge himself again and takes his throne. Zeus studies him and declares that he's returned. Apollo says that he has and asks everyone else who won the betting pool. This makes everyone shift in their seats with Hermes and Ares tying to play it off as just being worried about him. Apollo concludes that Ares must have lost the pool and Hermes says that Athena won. Apollo tries to move the conversation along and from across the room Dionysus says Apollo did a good job, to which Demeter agrees and praises him.

   Hera lifts her veil and says that at least Apollo did something. She continues and implies that it's Zeus's fault that Jason Grace is dead. Zeus gets mad and says that he didn't kill Jason, Caligula did. Hera snaps at him saying that at least Apollo grieved and got vengeance. Apollo is still shocked that Hera is standing up for him when she's never done this before. Zeus changes the topic stating that it appears that the fix is permanent, Python no longer exists, and all the oracles are freed once again. Zeus talks about the fates being free to do their jobs again and Apollo realizes he never thought about them being affected as well. He also picks up on Zeus's wording and how he said it appears the problem was fixed since he couldn't see the final battle go down. Apollo confirms that Python ceased to exist, and Zeus says that he is satisfied. Zeus welcomes him back to godhood, says he's forgiven, and welcomes him back to the throne. The gods ask what he will do now that he's a god again and Apollo replies that he wants to visit some old friends.

   Once the Council is dismissed, only Zeus and Apollo are left in the room. Zeus tells Apollo he knows he thinks what he did was harsh, and Apollo just doesn't reply. He continues going on about how only Apollo could have erased Python from existence and only he could have freed all the oracles. He says that he's proud of him and while Apollo has so many things to say to him, he keeps it short. He says he understands, and Zeus welcomes him home. Apollo rises asking to be excused since he has several other places to be.

   His first stop is to see his horses. He appears at the entrance of the sun palace and sees his valets are now gone. He notices that he has a pile up of packages and that place now has an old Helios smell like it usually does when he's gone for so long. There's a layer of dust on his throne and in stables he sees his horses who are happy to see him. He feeds them and feels happy to have a routine again. Apollo divides himself so he could quite literally be in multiple places at once and sends one to take care of his daily ride across the sky. Due to splitting himself, he can't remember the order all these encounters, but he knows they all happen.

   The second he arrives at Camp Half-Blood he is welcomed with all the campers chanting his name. For most of his visits he chooses to appear in Lester form feeling reassured in it. He is smothered with group hugs and notes that the younger campers carried themselves much more confidently now. Chiron looks proud of Apollo and tells him that he did well and will always be welcomed at camp. Next, he hugs Austin and Kayla, crying some more. He asks them about Meg, and they tell him that she went back to Palm Springs, to her father's old house with Lu and her foster siblings. He asks them if she's well and Austin replies back that she will be.

   He finds Dionysus sipping a diet coke and he takes a seat across from him. Dionysus says that at least one of them got a happy ending. Apollo thinks about this and different lengths of their punishment, however Apollo doesn't see his as a punishment but rather a journey and that he had grown from it. He tells Dionysus he will have a happy ending too but he's not saying that as a god of prophecy but rather someone with faith. Mr. D finds this amusing, but Apollo says that faith allows them to write their own stories and turn sour grapes into wine. Together they play a few games of pinochle well into the afternoon.

   Before dinner, Apollo goes to the Grove of Dodona. He thanks the trees for giving him the Arrow as a guide and without its help he would have failed and wouldn't have been able to erase Python from existence. The trees who were laughing at first stop as he continues his speech. He says that he will tell Rhea that they sent him their best and poofs away before they can see him smile hoping the Arrow would be having a good laugh.

   At night, he sits at the campfire with Will, Nico, and Rachel. Will and Nico are sitting next to each other while Rachel is looking at the stars. Rachel speaks first telling Apollo that everything's working again, she can see visions again and has already issued a few prophecies. All signs of Python have been erased from existence. Apollo asks about her destroyed house and Rachel says that this was a blessing in disguise because now she has the chance to take a gap year in Paris and study art. She assures them that she'll be back next year to issue more prophecies and Nico jokes that if he ever needs one, he could just shadow travel. Will senses that he's still thinking about Tartarus and Nico says that this is unfinished business. Apollo asks if he's sure it isn't Jason and Nico says he thought so at first and thought about bringing him back, but he knew he couldn't. Jason had made his choice, and this was different than Hazel's case who needed to come back and he thinks that Jason is somewhere better now. Apollo asks if he means Elysium or rebirth, but Nico doesn't know. What Nico does know is that the person who might need his help is a

   and this is where the Trogs would come in once again. Apollo wishes he could offer more help, but Will tells him it's okay that he's done his part already. He continues by saying a story never ends and that it just leads into others. He grabs Nico's hand and says they would do this together with or without a prophecy. Just when he finishes this sentence, Rachel launches into one. Apollo scrambles away in panic and as a result doesn't hear the prophecy. He tells Nico and Will that he'll let them figure this one out and Will says it didn't sound good.

Apollo then asks about Calypso and describes the expression on Leo's face as someone who is lovesick. At last, Leo tells Apollo that she's doing good is flourishing in high school. After Apollo asks, Leo tells him that she's away at band camp as a counselor and would be gone all summer. Leo says that it's fine and sometime apart would be good, Reyna overhears and said that she and Leo had a heart to heart about the topic.

Frank confirms that Hazel's curse is officially broken, she can now summon jewels and precious metals that can be used or spent without any curses. Hazel says they won't abuse this power, it will only be used to improve the camp or honor the gods. Apollo notices that Frank carries himself much differently now his destiny is no longer tied to a stick. Frank turns around and shows Apollo that he finally mastered the trick with his cloak and turns it into a sweater which makes Apollo smile.

   War Games
   for this feat. Tyson and Ella were back to work at the bookshop, the unicorns were still weaponized, and Jason Grace's temple expansion plan was still moving forward. Percy and Annabeth arrive in New Rome two months before the start of their freshman year of college. Annabeth talks about focusing on environmental design at UC Berkeley while dual enrolling at New Rome University. Percy cuts her off and tells her that she has to help him get through all his freshman year courses. Percy says he doesn't know what he's majoring in yet. Annabeth tells Apollo they won't be living together but in different dorms. Apollo asks about their travels and Percy says that they did with Grover, but the road trip was wild. Apollo starts thinking about the trip he took when he was bringing Jason's body back to Camp Jupiter. Percy catches on to what he's thinking about and says he and Annabeth found out when they got to Camp. Annabeth talks about crying and she wishes she had been able to be there for Piper. Apollo says that Piper is a tough girl, and that Jason was the best of them. He tells Percy his mom and sister are doing great and makes a plate of her cookies appear in his hands as a gift for him. This makes Percy happy, and he says he takes back almost everything he's said about him

   Apollo goes to visit Piper in Oklahoma and embarrasses himself. He appears on the roof and at the edge of the roof he can see two people sitting shoulder to shoulder. One leans over and kisses the other. Since Apollo's so flustered, he accidentally flashes like a camera light, getting the attention of the two lovebirds. He sees that Piper is on the left and a young lady with short dark hair, with a rhinestone nose stud on the right. Piper unlaces her fingers from the other girls' and talks about Apollo's timing. The girl on the right asks if this is her dad's boyfriend which Apollo knows Piper wouldn't be too excited about. She says he's an old family friend and asks to be excused so they can chat. Piper drags him to the far end of the roof and asks him what's up. He's flustered for a few seconds until he says he wanted to check in and make sure she's okay. She smiles and says she in the early days and Apollo says it's a process remembering their conversation back in California. He asks about her dad, and she says he seems more at peace here. Apollo tells her about Nero and Jason's funeral and Piper is glad that he did right by him. She can tell he hasn't forgotten about remembering what it's like to be human. Piper points at Shel and asks if it's alright for her to go back and Apollo tells her to take care of herself. She wishes the same for him and tells him that next time he wants to drop in, he should give her a heads up. He watches and she turns around and heads back to her new life.

   The final reunion happens with Meg. He appears in Lester form and tells the
   Meliai
   that he's Meg's servant. They lead him to Meg who is digging in the dirt with her foster siblings. Meg smiles when she sees him and says that he's back. Apollo notes that she is sunburned, and they hug. She tells her siblings to keep going and that she'll be back. Meg takes him on a tour where he sees Herophile the Sibyl, Joshua, and Aloe Vera. At last, they end up in the main room where he sees Lu sitting in a rocking chair. Lu wraps Apollo in a hug and tells him she's truly happy. She lets them get on with the tour and Meg leads Apollo to a terrace. Meg wipes a tear from her eye guessing that Apollo can't stay. He takes her hand and wants to keep his promise of rewarding her now that he's a god again. He says that he can't get rid of mortal problems with a snap and can see she doesn't want a reward. He says if she ever needs him, even just to talk, that he'll be there. Meg thanks him and says that she'd be okay with a unicorn. Apollo makes one appear and gives Apollo a hug as she asks if he'll always be her friend. Apollo says as long as she'll be his, which Meg can do. They talk longer but when the sun goes down Meg understands that he has to leave. She asks if he'll come back, and he says always, just like the sun.

   The book ends with Apollo saying his trials have come to an end. Six months and five volumes of adventures as well as pain and suffering. Like Meg, the reader deserves an award as well. He says he's fresh out of unicorns but anytime someone wants to fire their best shot or is trying to put their emotions into a song or poem, know that he is smiling on them. You're friends now, when you need him call on him and he'll be there for you.
