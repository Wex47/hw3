    Though the Greek and Roman crew-members of the Argo II have made progress in their many quests, they still seem no closer to defeating the earth mother, Gaea. Her giants have risen—all of them, and they're stronger than ever. They must be stopped before the Feast of Spes, when Gaea plans to have two demigods sacrificed in Athens. She needs their blood—the blood of Olympus—in order to wake. The demigods are having more frequent visions of a terrible battle at Camp Half-Blood. The Roman legion from Camp Jupiter, led by Octavian, is almost within striking distance. Though it is tempting to take the Athena Parthenos to Athens to use as a secret weapon, the friends know that the huge statue belongs back on Long Island, where it might be able to stop a war between the two camps. The Athena Parthenos will go west; the Argo II will go east. The gods, still suffering from multiple personality disorder, are useless. How can a handful of young demigods hope to persevere against Gaea's army of powerful giants? As dangerous as it is to head to Athens, they have no other option. They have sacrificed too much already. And if Gaea wakes, it is game over.

Nico has managed to open up somewhat, and shares the story of a rather clumsy attempt at Hades at bonding with him, by assigning him a zombie, Jules-Albert, to drive him around; it is made clear, though not stated explicitly, elsewhere in the story that Jules-Albert is the distinguished French auto-racing pioneer Marquis Jules-Albert de Dion, who died in 1946, and that this is a chance for him to continue pursuing his passion of driving. Having loosened up, Reyna explains about the ghosts, and why she and Hylla left San Juan and why she now wants to avoid it. Her father, Julian Ramirez-Arellano, a distinguished veteran left with PTSD as a result of his Iraq War experiences, suffered a fate similar to Jason and Thalia's mother Beryl Grace: becoming infatuated with Bellona and wishing to claim her for himself, as Beryl Grace had become infatuated with Zeus, he deteriorated mentally, eventually turning into a mania, and becoming violent and abusive to where Hylla and Reyna were frequently forced to flee the house. Eventually, when Reyna was ten, she was forced to defend Hylla from their father by stabbing him with Roberto Cofresi's saber, which she realized was Imperial gold when it killed Julian.

    Argo II
   </i>
   disintegrates upon arrival at Camp Half-Blood, but Leo mounts Festus and engages Gaea, along with Jason and Piper. Jason summons the winds and lifts himself and Piper into the air as Leo lifts Gaea off the ground in Festus' claws; Jason uses storm winds to keep Gaea away from the earth, her source of power, and Piper uses her charmspeak to lull Gaea to sleep, as Leo sends a blast of fire against her.

   Meanwhile, on the ground, Octavian reloads one of the onagers, not realizing that his robes have snagged in the mechanism so that triggering the onager will launch him to his death as well; Will, seeing this, attempts to dissuade Octavian from triggering the device, but Nico, and Michael Kahale, who has appeared on the scene, realize that they cannot stop Octavian and that in fact, it is desirable, even necessary, that he should die. Michael interposes himself between the onager and the two Greek demigods, draws his sword, and deliberately allows Octavian to launch himself to his own death along with the onager's explosive payload, which hits Gaea just as Leo blasts her with fire, doubling the fireball's destructive force and rendering Gaea, like her husband Ouranos, permanently dispersed and powerless.

   With Gaea finished, the combined Greek and Roman forces dispatch and scatter the monsters, incurring heavy casualties. Nico tells Percy his secret and earns himself Percy's confusion and a high-five from Annabeth. Jason decides to stay at Camp Half-Blood with Piper but with frequent trips to Camp Jupiter. Percy and Annabeth decide to finish their senior year of high school in New York City and go to college in New Rome. At the end it is also revealed that Leo died in the explosion, but was brought back to life using the Physician's Cure. He lands in Ogygia with Festus, picks up Calypso, and flies off into the unknown.
