The only way to get out is to push your fingers together and take it off that way.

   magical item
   no longer works and is back in her cabin. A voice tells her that she has intelligence, giving Annabeth the drive to move forward and make a rope ladder using plastic swords and kite string. She climbs down but keeps the string just in case she needs it later. She continues on and enters a shrine to the god
   Mithras

   . Several ghostly worshipers of Mithras appear and ask Annabeth a series of questions about the god. Despite Annabeth not knowing anything about Mithras, there are clues all over the room and Annabeth manages to fool them into believing she knows everything about their god. As a show of power, she then hits a capstone holding the room together and the shrine begins to crumble. Annabeth escapes the room, but falls down a small pit and ends up breaking her ankle. She uses some

   Hermes Express
   , but they only contain bubble wrap. However, she uses the bubble wrap and some string to make a cast to hold her ankle in place while it heals. For her last test, she walks into a hallway filled with spiderwebs and weaves a pathway across a large ditch as the spiders start to follow her, but do not follow her across. Annabeth then enters a large room lined with beautiful tapestries but is quickly captured by their weaver,

   Meanwhile, Leo, Hazel, and Frank end up getting lost in the city as Hazel has a hard time getting a lock on anything with so much under Rome. They eventually find their way to the Pantheon and Leo quickly spots a secret lock leading to a small entryway downward. Hazel agrees to take a look, leaving Leo and Frank along together. The two open up a bit, with Leo even pointing out they both lost their mothers to fire in some way. Leo even offers to find a way to help Frank find a solution to keep his stick safe, but they are interrupted when the

Percy is unable to breathe and the nymphs begin to drain the three of their power, stealing Percy's control over water, Jason's control over the rain, and Piper's beauty in order to be young again. Piper comes up with the idea to funnel all their positive thoughts into the Cornucopia, which releases the positive emotions as clean water. As the three release almost all their power into the Cornucopia, the nymphs become young again and spare the three, as the power they gave them as a gift and they restore the trio back to full strength, as well as telling them the location of Otis and Ephialtes.

They had also planned on letting Nico die in public, but because of his "death trance", he has been asleep and has no entertainment value, leading to the giants tipping over the jar and releasing him. Nico rolls out and Percy is unable to tell if he is alive or not. Percy tries to keep the giants distracted as Nico wakes up and begins to crawl away. The twins mention that even if Percy should be kept alive for the bounty, Annabeth is already doomed and Leo, Hazel, and Frank are locked up, meaning the giants can kill Percy, Jason, and Piper.

A hydra is released, leading Percy to set a large stack of fireworks off, which destroy the hydra, but also destroy many different areas of the twins' hypogeum and knocking out Piper. When Jason runs to her, Otis tosses his spear at him, which Jason deflects with a gust of wind and it strikes Ephialtes right in his side, turning him to dust. A piece of the ceiling then falls on Otis, turning him to dust as well. However, the two need to be killed by a god and demigod working together and they instantly reform.

Ephialtes then escapes from the fake mountain and charges the two, managing to disarm them both and almost kills them, but the

   Hall of the Gods
   . She shows Arachne a picture of Frank's Chinese finger-cuffs on her laptop, but it is so large that Arachne would need a lot more silk. Annabeth suggests using some thread covering the

Annabeth's own hubris shows itself when she teases Arachne that she has done Athena a great service by keeping the statue safe and it alone should be displayed on

He also says that Percy is the most powerful demigod he knows and he will do everything in his power to keep Annabeth safe. Everyone is still down, however, until Leo encourages everyone. He declares that he will use the sphere of Archimedes and ancient scrolls to upgrade the ship with new weapons so that Gaea will not know what hit her. He also says he will save Annabeth and Percy, even if he has to make a crane that will reach all the way to Tartarus.
