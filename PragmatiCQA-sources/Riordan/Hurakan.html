   Hurakan was responsible for designing the human body. He helped Kukuulkaan create them four different times,
   as the powerful gods wanted to have creatures, unlike animals, worship them. They first made them out of mud, but the humans were weak and useless. So the two destroyed them with a flood or the humans dissolved by themselves. Then they used wood to make another batch, but they were dumb
