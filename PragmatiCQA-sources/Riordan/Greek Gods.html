He would have devoured Zeus as well, but Rhea, unable to bear the pain of losing another child and seeing her husband now for the monster he was, entered into an alliance with

   After years in hiding, Zeus was finally old enough and strong enough to overthrow his father. He returned to Kronos' palace to free his siblings who, being immortals, remained alive and undigested within their father’s stomach.

   At first, the Titans had an advantage, due to being more experienced, but in time, the gods themselves became experienced and fierce warriors too, and with the help of their new weapons, were able to prevail. During the final battle, the gods gathered on Mount Olympus, the tallest mountain after Mount Othrys, and Zeus used the Master Bolt to sheer off the top of Mount Othrys and topple Kronos' Black Throne.

   The gods were also challenged by Typhon the storm giant who was the last and arguably most powerful son of Gaea and Tartarus. The gods, upon seeing the big monstrosity, fled all the way to Egypt except Zeus who tried to fight the monster. He was overwhelmed eventually and had his divine tendons torn off. Zeus eventually managed to get his tendons back with the help of a few other gods and a satyr and then, using trickery, he managed to hurl a mountain on top of the storm giant and imprisoned him this way.

   As they follow the flow of Western Civilization, the gods will change slightly to reflect the culture of the country they currently reside in. Normally, this change has only a small effect and is not permanent. Such changes include Zeus wearing designer suits and Apollo's chariot becoming a sports car. However, the gods have resided in Rome almost as long as they ruled from Greece, and therefore each god has a permanent Roman aspect to themselves that they can change into. In this form, the gods became more disciplined, warlike, and militaristic ― the characteristics associated with the ancient Roman Empire.

   While the gods are normally in harmony with both of their forms, this can change if their Greek and Roman children begin to know about, and consequently, resent, and finally declare war on each other. Because both camps call their godly parents for help, both their Roman and Greek forms are at odds with each other, giving the gods splitting headaches, indecision, and focus problems. They are also slightly schizophrenic. If, for example, a god in his Roman aspect appears before a demigod who thinks about the god in his Greek aspect, the god's form will flicker back and forth from his Roman and Greek forms - apparently causing intense headaches - until the god is able to settle back into one form.

   The gods do possess some weaknesses, physical or otherwise. They can be injured by supernatural weapons, but are invulnerable to conventional physical attacks. If a god's domain is attacked, he/she may weaken, age, and take the form to represent their current state of said domain. Gods can also fade from existence — either from a lack of worship or the diminishing of their domain (such gods are

   A god can survive a lack of worship or loss of their domain so long as their will to live is strong enough. Otherwise, they will fade. However, even if their will is strong enough they won't be powerful enough to maintain a physical form, as Kronos was able to survive, due to sheer willpower, yet remain powerless in Tartarus. If their thrones (or other sources of power) are destroyed, they will also fade along with it or become so weakened that they can no longer take a physical form, as stated in

   Gods are, in general lustful — with the exceptions of the
   maiden goddesses
   and deities of marriage — and often have many illegitimate children, both immortal and demigod. Most gods also tend to be petty or immature and a lot of them are arrogant and underestimate their opponents, for example Ares underestimated Percy and that resulted in him being defeated by the latter. Because the gods are immortal, they feel little reason to change or adapt (except to adapt to their current

   In addition, the gods can be very prideful of the things they do or the choices they make. They are often too proud to admit when they need help or when they have committed mistakes, instead believing themselves to be beyond help from regular

   and demigods. Gods generally believe that they should be feared and respected. Due to their pride, they see admitting they need help as a sign of weakness. Furthermore, the gods will show signs of contempt towards the children of their enemies, sometimes even if those children are the offspring of other gods, most likely since Divine Laws prevent gods from attacking each other directly and thus do fight through their demigod offspring. It is these traits that often cause many beings, both mortal and immortal alike, to hate the gods and the reason why the gods are occasionally viewed as being no better than the Titans.
