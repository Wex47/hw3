   Apollo then went to talk to Percy, who was sitting on his bed. Percy recalled the last time he had a nosebleed after seeing Apollo's blood on his carpet, making Apollo remember how he was turned mortal. Percy told Apollo that the last time he saw him it was August, and now it was January. After Apollo said he didn't know how long he had been out, Percy recalled how Hera wiped his memory and that he hated memory gaps. After Apollo asked Percy to help him, Percy explained that he won't turn away a demigod in need, but he cannot get involved in another prophecy, since he made promises to his mom and

  <p key="b7df56d7-f8b0-4bba-a0ef-9826817f4d6d">
   Percy, Meg, and Apollo ate lunch together, and Percy complained about how he hates studying, since
   New Rome University
   required him to pass the DSTOMP test, all of his classes, and the SAT. Percy inquired that he would never forgive Apollo for writing a hard portion on the DSTOMP. Percy explained to Meg how he was a demigod, and asked Apollo how he and Meg met. Their story was interrupted when Sally brought Percy lunch, and Percy agreed with Apollo that his mom was awesome. Apollo explained to Percy the other two times he was a mortal, and how he was Meg's servant. The three also discussed what spirits may be following them, and Percy toyed with the possibility that Apollo may be barred from entering Camp, which worried him. Percy joked with Meg about how he started his demigod career by exploding a toilet, making her giggle, but she frowned when she found out he had a girlfriend. Sally then brought the three cookies, but then said Percy cannot have any unless he comes back safely, and made him promise he would be right back. Percy then told Apollo and Meg that a batch of cookies were at stake for him.

  <p key="f47d3192-d867-4881-8d0a-30d9f4493d44">
   Percy drove Meg and Apollo close to Camp from Manhattan in Sally's Prius. Percy warned Apollo to not jinx them if they were being followed and explained to Meg that the Oracle isn't working. When Apollo said he hoped demigods went on a quest to solve it by now, Percy said that without prophecies, there cannot be quests, so they are stuck in a Catch 88. Suddenly, when they saw spirits, Percy swerved and drove through a drive thru and a strip mall to get away. Percy drove through a railroad crossing and soon ended up in a countryside near Camp. Percy then swerved, damaging the car. Percy, Meg, and Apollo left the car after that.

   Percy was upset and annoyed when he found out the monsters that were attacking them were
   Nosoi
   , and Percy said that when it seemed that he killed everything in Greek Mythology, he didn't. The three fought the Nosoi, and Percy wanted to cut them up with

   . Percy charged into battle, but every time he defeated them they dissolved into glittery mist then re solidified. Percy caused a tank to rupture to try to kill them, but it was no use. Percy soon after accidentally ran into a plume of smoke the Nosoi made, and he was unable to breathe. But Percy and Apollo were saved after Meg, with the help of
   Peaches
   , defeated the Nosoi. Percy was skeptical of the
   Karpoi
   , because he did not like them, but he was shocked how he liked Meg, so he trusted him. Percy was sick from the smoke and sneezed with such force that an irrigation pipe exploded behind him. Percy offered to drive them to Camp, but police came to tow the Prius, and Percy stayed while was interrogated and told the two how to get to Camp.

   Colossus Neronis
   . They landed on the statues head and the Hellhound peed on the statues head, startling Percy. Percy immediately asked Apollo what he did, and Apollo told him it was only partially his fault, but he was making a plan to fix it. Percy threw a spike at the statues head and tried to get his dog to attack it. He jumped from the statues head to its shoulder and slid down it to the ground, impressing Apollo. Percy got the statue to chase him as he ran to the beach. During the battle, when Apollo began to doubt if he could make the shot to the statue, Percy and

Percy tried to reassure Apollo that he belonged at Camp and that he was once in the same situation, but Apollo insisted that he must free the other Oracles to save everyone. When Apollo said he wanted to give up looking for Meg, Percy said that he should keep looking since they'd lost too many good people-

   According to Kronos, Percy inherited Poseidon's "too changeable, unpredictable" nature. Percy is a very kind-hearted, brave-spirited, natural leader. Many people tell him he is brave, such as friends, family, strangers, and even gods. He has the same "brooding" look as his father, which always had him branded as a rebel; his mother has a rebellious streak just like him. Percy is characterized by his sarcastic, smart sense of humor, and laid-back demeanor. His girlfriend Annabeth mentions that he is actually quite smart, but seems to act dumb.

   Percy is somewhat short-tempered and thus has trouble controlling his anger, such as when he sees bullying. He can be derisively sarcastic and moody, especially when someone tries to manipulate him or forces him to obey. He does not like to follow rules, as shown when he escapes camp to go on the quest to save Grover, and when he bowed to

   . Like many heroes, Percy is very reckless and tends to do or blurt out things before thinking, causing him to get into a lot of trouble. He feels responsible for everyone and anything which goes wrong.

   According to Annabeth, Percy is obtuse, meaning he doesn't always see the obvious even when it is right in front of him, such as people's feelings and what they are trying to say indirectly. He has romantic feelings for Annabeth over the course of the series, but he finally confirms them in

   Although he has many friends in Camp Half-Blood, Percy is considered a troublemaker in school with a track record of expulsions, like most demigods. His dyslexia makes learning and reading difficult and his ADHD makes it hard for him to be attentive or to sit still in class. He has never been one of the "cool" kids in class because he hangs out with supposedly "un-cool" people, such as his best friend Grover Underwood or his half-brother Tyson. Possibly because of his bad history in school, Percy feels a strong level of affection and attachment to Camp Half-Blood. In

   According to Athena, Percy's fatal flaw is excessive personal loyalty: he would risk the world and even his own life to save his friends and family. He sometimes saves strangers or enemies simply because he empathizes with them. When Percy protests that personal loyalty isn't all that bad, Athena says "The most dangerous flaws are good in moderation" The goddess was obviously displeased that her own daughter is an object of that loyalty. Kronos previously exploited this trait in

Percy confided in him that felt like he deserved to choke after what he did to

Nico covered for Percy so he could go on the quest, but made him promise to protect her. Percy didn't want to make any promises, but Nico forced him to promise, and Percy promised to do his best. Nico wished him luck and ran off. Percy also convinced Nico not to go on the quest himself.

He was also mad at him for hiding his last from him and thought of scathing things to say to him. But he wanted to rescue him and couldn't stand seeing him in pain in a bronze jar, and didn’t want him to suffocate him to death. He also wanted to find him because he knew where the Doors of Death were. In Rome, he helped rescue him with Jason and piper, and was the most determined out of the three to rescue him. However, he was annoyed when he could barely crawl out of the jar, and wanted him to crawl more and groan less. When they went back on to the

Percy liked her but could sense she had a deep sadness inside of her: mature for her age, nice and easygoing, but hiding a big secret. He didn't believe she would have anything to be guiltily about and thought she was nice. As for Hazel, she was in awe of him. When she first saw him, she thought he was a god in disguise, with an aura of power, and ordered Frank not to fire on him, since she thought it was the gods testing her. But when she learned he was the son of Neptune, she hoped he would heal her curse. She could also sense he was more dangerous than Jason, Nico, Reyna, or Octavian.

As she got to know him, she realized he was smarter than he looked and learned not to underestimate him, even if he thought the questions he asked at first were silly.

But to his surprise, Hazel kissed him on the cheek and smiled with sisterly affection, saying of course she trusted him, they were family. The kiss made Percy feel warm down to his feet. Percy felt lucky to have Frank and Hazel watching over him, and thought of them as the bright spots in his scary life after his memory loss. Hazel and Frank were the only things making Percy feel not alone, and promised that he wouldn’t lose them. And when they made it to Alaska, Percy saved Hazel from Gaea and promised her that they would find Nico. The two later promised each other that they would make it back home, Percy would see Annabeth again, and Hazel make it back to Camp. Percy said that Hazel was too valuable to him and the camp and he wouldn't let anything happen to her. Percy reassured Hazel that there was more to her destiny than dying since that she was destined to fight Gaea with him, and her life was worth fighting for. Once they got back to Camp Jupiter, Percy was glad that Hazel was being treated well and as a savior of Rome, and knew that she deserved it. Percy knew Hazel wanted time alone with Frank and respected that, letting them walking around New Rome alone. The next day, Percy promised Hazel that he would find Nico as soon as they made it to Rome.

When Leo fired on Camp Jupiter by accident, Percy asked if Hazel was going to come with him to Rome, and Hazel said she would, and bought him some time so he could escape from the angry Romans. Percy was very protective of Hazel on the quest, and when she went off with Leo, Percy pulled Leo aside to tell him Hazel's story.

Reyna decided to question him in the principia before bringing him to

     Aurum
     and
     Argentum
     , but she reassured him that they won't attack. Percy told Reyna what he remembered and she believed him, except for the fact that he had no memory. But she slightly warmed up to Percy when she said that children of

Since Percy came from outside the camp, Hazel asked if he met their missing praetor Jason Grace. Hazel said the Romans were searching for Jason and have not given up after his disaperance. Reyna grimaced at Hazel's statement, which made Percy realize that Reyna considered Jason to be more than a colleague, and she had strong feelings for him. Reyna wished him luck in the auguries and suggested that they compare notes on his past.

     after his auguries were favorable, but looked at him with pity since he was in the worst cohort. Percy also sympathized for Reyna and could tell how much Octavian bugged her and tried to ruin things for her. After the senate meeting, Reyna wanted to talk to Percy in private. Reyna vented about how much she hated Octavian, Percy understood and Reyna said he was smarter than he looked. Reyna then asked Percy if he remembered her or Hylla, and when Percy said he didn't, and Reyna explained how he and Annabeth destroyed their home when she was young. Percy said he didn't remember and Reyna decided that he was sincere. Reyna believed the gods sent Percy to make up for the loss of Jason and save her home. Reyna spoke very highly of Jason, which made Percy ask if they were a couple. Reyna said they might've been and that if she were given more time with Jason, a romantic relationship would have formed. Reyna said she wants to work with a Praetor that is an honest warrior like Jason. Since Percy reminded Reyna of Jason, she offered him the praetorship. Reyna admitted that a son of Neptune wouldn't be her first choice, but she prefers Percy over Octavian (a schemer), Hazel, and Frank. Reyna tells Percy that she wants to work with him to save her camp. Reyna says that together, they can save the legion, close the doors of death, and defeat Gaea. Reyna tells Percy during this time; she would be a helpful friend. Percy realized she was asking him out and said that he had a girlfriend, and didn't want power, and Reyna inquired that it wasn't very Roman of him. Reyna confided in Percy about how

After their conversation ended, Percy noticed that Reyna was extremely desperate to save Camp Jupiter. Reyna knew that she couldn't do this alone and grasped at anything that could help the legion. Percy understood why Reyna would ask him for help after seeing visions of Polybote's army. Percy apologized again before he left, and Reyna said that apologies weren't very Roman, and that she hoped he would consider her offer.

At the Feast of Fortuna, Reyna honored Percy and said that their destinies were made possible by Percy's deeds, then made him praetor, saying he earned his praetor's cloak. Reyna trusted Percy enough to believe him when he told her that he was a Greek demigod, Jason was coming back, and that the Greek gods were still around, and told the legion to trust him. When Percy told Reyna that Jason was returning, she hoped that was true. Reyna said she had missed Jason

When they made it to the Parthenon, Percy and Annabeth kissed passionately and though Piper felt awkward, she thought his relationship with Annabeth was the perfect example of love. Percy apologized, and Piper grinned and said he was a great boyfriend, approving of his relationship with Annabeth. Piper was very worried when Percy got a nosebleed and the blood of Olympus spilled.

     Zeus has mixed feelings for his nephew. He was upset over his birth because it violated the pact that he, Poseidon, and Hades made after World War II to not bear any more children, even as he himself did no better by conceiving Thalia. Zeus is nevertheless thankful for the demigod's past services to both himself and Olympus as a whole. During the
     Winter Solstice
     council meeting in

    However, Zeus once warned Percy that he will strike him down if he ever travels in the sky. Though it is never brought up again by his uncle, Percy is very mindful of traveling by land or sea. However, it seems that in extreme situations, Percy is allowed to fly on Blackjack, be carried by the

    Hades was later convinced by his son to aid Percy in the war and played an indirect role in his wish for general acceptance through earlier advice to Nico about getting a "solemn oath." Given that Percy is directly responsible for his position on the council with full privileges and rights, it would be fair to say that Hades has an improved opinion about him.

   Percy is portrayed by
   Logan Lerman
   . His character's age has been increased from 12 to 16 to appeal to older viewers. Throughout the film series, Percy hasn't been shown to be able to remain dry underwater or anywhere else either. Due to this and many other reasons, the films were received badly by fans who thought it deviated too far off course from the books. Rick Riordan also revealed that he'd sent emails to Fox and Disney critizising the script of the movie and explaining that parents would never show such content to their children and that disgusted fans would be flocking out of movie theatres in droves.

     Perseus
    </b>
    is a Greek name derived from the verb (perthein), meaning “to waste, ravage or destroy”. Thus, his name means “the destroyer”, possibly alluding to his role in the Great Prophecy (i.e, Olympus to preserve or raze) and his father Poseidon, who is known as the Earth-Shaker and often destroying places due his earthquakes. His mother named Percy after the hero Perseus, as he was the only hero who had a happy ending in the Greek myths, although Percy originally favored Hercules.

    Rick Riordan has said that he gave Percy the name "Perseus" simply because he liked the name. In Greek Mythology, Perseus was the son of Zeus, not Poseidon. Riordan made Percy a son of Poseidon because, in his words, "everyone is a son of Zeus". In myth, most of the known demigods are children of Zeus and he found it unfair.
