   Sadly, Nico's popularity only lasted a few weeks. After that campers did whatever they could to avoid him and forgot he was at camp. (Though a year or so later Will Solace tells him this never happened, he in fact isolated himself). The fact that Percy had begun dating Annabeth did not make Nico feel any better. As a result, Nico takes to only showing up at Camp from time to time. Sometime after the Battle of Manhattan, Hades gave Nico a French zombie chauffeur,

His dark hair is longer and frames his face. However, the area around his sunken eyes is very dark, while his complexion is even paler than before," a sickly greenish-white, like the color of tree sap." Being a demigod from another era, Nico radiates "a kind of old energy - a melancholy that came from knowing he didn't belong in the modern world."

   Jason comments that since getting out of Tartarus, Nico "had slept little and eaten even less." Seeing Nico casually eat a grape, he thinks that that will be his food for the day. Later, Jason is surprised that Nico actually has visible muscles when he takes off his jacket. According to Hazel, when upset, Nico's face would become "as dark as Tartarus." When Jason infuriates him, the ground opens up and Nico "glows with ghostly light." When Bryce infuriates him, the temperature around Nico drops to freezing, turning the ground around him white with frost. Several demigods, including Leo, Frank, and even Jason all admit to being afraid of the son of Hades.

Later in the book, Nico puts several mortals to sleep by sending deep dreams their way.

     to kill himself, showing he cared very much about Will's opinion of him. To his surprise, Will is more upset that Nico didn't offer to help him, or more importantly, spend time with him after it was all over. Will ordered Nico to stay with him in infirmary for three days, and Nico "felt like a hundred skeletal butterflies were resurrecting in his stomach". Will also seems to reciprocate said feelings, or at the very least, is willing to be closer friends with the son of Hades.

They continue their playful banter with each other, and are usually seen sitting close by, holding hands. In fact, Apollo claims that Nico and Will are so cute together as a couple, that it made him feel desolate, jogging his memories of the time he had spent with his mortal boyfriend Hyacinthus, one of Apollo's two all-time favorite lovers (the other being Daphne). Nico on his part, is always ready to help and support Will, such as when he tirelessly helped his boyfriend tend to wounded campers (notably

Once they got to Salona flew Nico into the sky, which made Nico angry about being touched. He thought having Nico around was not reassuring when they went underground, especially with the glow of his Stygian Iron sword. Jason comforted him when Nico was nervous about confronting Cupid, even though he thought it's just a crush on Annabeth, and said it may be embarrassing, but it's just for the scepter. When the two arrive in Salona, Jason is grateful to have Nico there with him, and the two defended each other during Cupid's attacks, with Nico helping Jason up when he fell. Nico even let himself be bullied by Cupid so he could leave Jason alone. Jason was so shocked by what he saw from Nico's past that he was unable to move or speak. But Jason realized by Nico was so afraid, and realized he had a crush on Percy. Nico eventually was forced to confess that he had a crush on Percy, and Jason accepted him immediately, thinking about his perspective of being gay in the 1940s, and told Nico that he wouldn't tell anyone if he didn’t want to. Nico almost cried, and said he didn't like Percy anymore, saying he was young and impressionable. Jason said he had seen people do many brave things, but what he had done was the bravest.

Jason encourages Nico to take a risk be his friend and that everyone will accept him for being gay, and that's who he is. Jason also tells Nico to stop running away and stop hiding, which angers Nico, making Jason grab his sword believing a fight is about to start.

Jason worries about him and is grateful that he went to bring the Athena Parthenos. Every time Jason sacrificed his food to Jupiter, Jason prayed that his father will help him. Nico, on the other hand, is still embarrassed about Salona and when Jason picked him up. Nevertheless, Nico's primary concern other than Hazel is for Jason. When Nico found out that anyone from the Seven may die, Nico felt he was back in the bronze jar. He was grateful for Jason and the Seven for saving him and Rome and welcoming him on the ship.

When Jason asked if he may be still alive, Nico apologized, saying he wished he could say otherwise, but he felt him die. He felt guilty for squashing Jason's hopes, but he knew it wasn't fair to give him false They also talked about how maybe they don't need more prophecies for awhile, after they find out the Oracle was blocked. Jason tried to convince Nico to stay at Camp again, but when Jason finds out Nico is staying at Camp Half-Blood, Jason almost hugged him, but he realized he didn't like touching and apologized, but Nico said he was an exception. Jason then have him a bear hug so hard his ribs cracked.

Nevertheless, after Percy saved them from Geryon, Annabeth told Nico that Bianca's death wasn’t Percy's fault and that Kronos would do anything to get Nico on his side, and that Bianca wouldn't want to be brought back to life by him. But this made Nico more upset, telling Annabeth that she didn't care about Bianca, and that if she did she would help him. But even after everything Nico said to her, Annabeth helped him summon Bianca's ghost and kept spirits away from him. She also told Nico that his sister was right when she told him that his anger will be his doom, and reminded him again that Kronos would do anything to get him on his side. The next morning, Annabeth tried to convince him to join the group, saying that Bianca just wanted him to be okay, and put her hand on his shoulder, but he brushed her off and walked away. After he left, Annabeth told Percy she was worried about him and scared he would talk to

     Westover Hall
     . However, Annabeth herself has no feelings for him beyond kinship, since he is too young, too moody, and has a certain darkness in him that makes Annabeth uneasy. Furthermore, she has always found it hard to "read" Nico and his actions. However, Annabeth still admits to feeling responsible for him, and can relate to feeling like Nico did after Bianca's death—a homeless orphan, drifting through the world alone. Annabeth was upset when she found out about Nico's imprisonment, and listened to the news sadly, shaking her head, but she wasn't surprised at all by the news, and figured out he would die on the Kalends of July. She also figured out rescuing him was a trap, but felt a responsibility to save him.

He even leaned over the chasm, reaching out to help her and Percy, to no avail. The last sounds Annabeth heard before falling was Nico and Hazel screaming for help. Later, when Nico arrived back on the ship, Nico reassured Leo that Percy Annabeth were not dead, and if they were he would feel it.

As for Annabeth, in Tartarus, she was in disbelief when she found out Nico helped them, and said she had no idea what drove him, and couldn't figure him out. When he left with Reyna and Hedge, she wished I’m good luck, and he wished her good luck in return, without making eye contact.

While Nico is still very jealous of Annabeth, and wants to hate her, he cannot bring himself to, since Annabeth's gratitude was genuine and sincere, and she never overlooked or avoided Nico like most people. Hence, Nico admits to himself that it would have been far easier for him if she were a horrible person. Later in the book, when Hades reveals to Nico that one of the Seven is destined to die, the idea of any of them (even Annabeth) dying made him feel empty—like he was back in the dark Giants' Bronze Jar.

Frank, along with Leo and Hazel, helped track down Nico and was determined to save him. After he was rescued, Nico thanked everyone, including Frank, saying he had almost lost hope. Nico later reassured Frank that Percy and Annabeth falling into Tartarus wasn't his fault.

Frank thought he seemed to dematerialize when he wasn't speaking, and didn't know what scared him more: Hordes of reckless ghosts, cow monsters, or being alone with Nico. Frank couldn't think of him being kind to anyone, other than Hazel, and wondered why he helped everyone if he hated Percy so much. He was even always scared of Nico. Frank was relived when Hazel went with them to Venice so he didn't have to be alone with Nico. But Frank still tried to be his friend and encouraged him to talk about his past and his childhood in Venice. Frank was angry at Nico and wanted to kill him after Hazel was poisoned, and wanted to strangle him. His anger subsided when it was revealed that he used to play
     Mythomagic
     too, however. And when he was turned into a plant by
     Triptolemus
     , he demanded that he be turned back, calling him "his friend", and slammed the minor god into a wall for not healing Hazel or Nico faster. Later, Nico called Frank brave for killing all of the
     Katobleps
     in Venice, but became shocked when he found out he actually killed all of them.

Later, Frank trusted Nico to guide him into the house of hades. Nico and Frank fought off hordes of monsters together in the

He thought that it was a good sign he could talk openly about his lifeline. Nico told Frank that he wasn't close to death and he had many more adventures ahead of him. He told him to be good to Hazel, and that he was a good guy, though secretly jealous of his happy relationship.

As their mother died when they were young, Bianca assumes an almost motherly role, bearing the responsibility that a parent would normally bear. Bianca was very overprotective and close with Nico, and Bianca had a tendency to argue with Nico a lot and get annoyed, like when they were arguing at the
     Westover Hall
     school dance, waving their hands. And when Nico said it was cool when he found out they were demigods, Bianca said it was not cool and that they weren’t demigods. Bianca also has a tendency to not believe Nico, like when he said when a bus driver had thorns. However, Bianca deeply loved Nico and said he was the only family she had left, feeling alone. Nico also loved Bianca, clinging to her and telling her that he was scared when the

While on the bus back to Camp, Bianca whispered something in Nico's ear, but he scowled and looked away. However, Nico still had love for Bianca left, and he told Percy to join the quest to protect her, and made him promise to. On the quest, Bianca confided in Percy that she loved Nico but she wanted to know what It'd be like to not be a big sister 24/7. But Bianca proved that she still cared for Nico when she died trying to get a gift for Nico in

     When Bianca appeared to Nico, Nico was excited to see her, and her face was sad, like she was dreading this for a long time, and told Nico that he had gotten tall. Nico questioned why she hadn’t answered him and she said he hoped he would give up, making Nico's heart break. Bianca told Nico not to try to save him and that Percy is right, putting her hand on his face. Bianca told Nico that he must forgive Percy, and that grudges are fatal flaws for children of Hades, and that he must promise her. She then told him to admit that he was mad at her, not Percy, and he was mad at her for abandoning him to join the Hunters, and she apologized for that. But she said he must overcome the anger. Nico was still in denial though, wanting his sister back. Bianca then started to tell him that if he loved him, to not bring her back, but then she said that Tartarus was stirring, and that she must leave. Nico didn't want her to leave, but Bianca said that she loved him, and to remember what she said. Nico cried that night about the exchange and was jealous of Percy that Bianca summoned him, but gave up on trying to get her back. After the

Maria was a great mother who cared for her children, and was determined to live with them and protect them. It is mentioned that Maria raised Nico and Bianca in a conservative Catholic family.

    Cupid is the only god the son of Hades truly fears, having grown up in a time where being romantically involved with anyone other then someone of the opposite gender was unthinkable and persecuted against. Upon learning who they had to meet to get

    , Nico panicked. The longer Nico was in his presence, the more the god of love pressured Nico into revealing that he had a romantic attraction to a male friend. After the son of Hades was forced to admit his crush on Percy, Cupid became visible and apologized for forcing the information out of him before leaving and granting them the scepter, showing hoew the god had some compassion for Nico.

    , and describes the former as looking like a watered-down, unhealthy version of Will, without anything in him that makes a child of Apollo special. Octavian, on the other hand, seems to have finally come to appreciate what a powerful ally Nico could potentially be for him, as he claims to see a decent amount of ruthlessness in the son of Hades, which he also greatly appreciates. Hence, Octavian promptly attempts to sway the son of Hades to his side, arguing that the Greeks hadn't ever actually done anything for the former. Octavian claims that he can beat any offer the Greeks might have given Nico, and assures him a place in

While Nico isn't at all saddened by Octavian's death, he is very guilt-ridden, since Nico feels that him choosing not to prevent Octavian's death unnecessarily cost Leo his life, something that he is unable to forgive himself for. Nico is also horrified of Will now possibly thinking of him as a monster for letting Octavian die, but is extremely relieved to learn of that not being the case.
