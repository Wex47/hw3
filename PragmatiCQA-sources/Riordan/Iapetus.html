During the murder, Iapetus was kicked in the face by his thrashing father (something his brothers frequently teased him about afterwards). However, right before Kronos sliced him up, Ouranos predicted that one day Kronos himself would suffer the same fate at the hands of his own child. Most notably, while Hyperion, Krios, Koios, and Kronos all roared with laughter after defeating their father, Iapetus felt nauseous. Afterwards, Kronos hurled all of the remaining pieces of Ouranos into the sea as a gesture of loathing against his brother

   One evening, when Iapetus was dining with his brothers and nephews, Zeus prepared nectar mixed with sleeping potion for Iapetus, and a powerful emetic for Kronos. As before, Zeus entertained them all with his great singing, dancing, and jokes. Near the end of the Titanic banquet, Zeus encouraged all of the Titans to have yet another drinking contest, and handed out the prepared goblets. As before, Kronos won the contest, but the emetic caused him to disgorge all his swallowed children, while Iapetus was temporarily knocked out by the sleeping potion, and could not stop them from escaping.

   Shortly thereafter, all six of Kronos' children quickly declared war against their father, as well as the other Titans, which resulted in the terrifying 11-year-long Titanomachy. Iapetus initially had the upper hand in his battles with the gods, since he was a very skilled and a much more experienced warrior. However, the gods quickly became skilled warriors as well, and with the help of their new extremely powerful weapons (Zeus' Master Bolt, Poseidon's Trident, and Hades' Helm of Darkness), as well as the aid of the Elder

   </a>

   ), and while his brothers roared with laughter after defeating their father, Iapetus felt nauseous. However, Iapetus did seem to regard demigods with contempt (though most deities tend to view lesser beings with contempt anyway), since although

    Kronos'

   Apparently, he cared about keeping his promises as, when he was regaining his memories, he said that both Iapetus and Bob didn't like breaking promises. As he regained his memories, Iapetus' knowledge surfaced more and more, but his personality remained buried. Some of this may have been by choice as while talking to

   , Bob tells him that he prefers himself as Bob, showing that Iapetus may have seen his memory loss as a second chance. This is further demonstrated when after his memories fully return, the "Bob" personality remains in charge instead of Iapetus' more cruel one appearing. After many of his memories are restored by a conversation with

His helpful nature eventually earns him Annabeth's admiration which is not very easy to win so quickly, and Percy is ashamed of himself for not caring for him. Even as he regains his memory slowly and learns that Percy erased it in the first place, he remains loyal, although faltering briefly for a moment until Percy apologizes for being a bad friend. Some of his loyalty, despite his faltering, is because he made a promise to help and he doesn't like breaking promises.

   As he regains his memories, Bob seems torn between his identity as Iapetus and Bob. While he still retains the personality of Bob, he also retains the knowledge of Iapetus and the more that knowledge comes out, the more his memories return. As he learns his past, he struggles with it, although Annabeth takes it as a good sign he continues to go by "Bob" even after learning that he is Iapetus. His time as Bob fundamentally changes him as when he finally regains his memories fully, he chooses to remain "Bob" and help his friends after Percy suggests that he takes the parts of Iapetus' past that he wants while leaving everything else behind. He stands up to Tartarus himself, despite knowing it will lead to his death, stating that he chooses to be more than just a regular Titan. He also identifies himself as Bob, showing that he has chosen to be Bob rather than Iapetus. Despite this, his personality changes somewhat, possibly showing a merge between Iapetus and Bob as he's more mature and sure of himself than he previously was.
