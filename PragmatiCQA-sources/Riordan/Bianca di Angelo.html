   Zoë Nightshade described Bianca as caring and having a kind heart, which made her ideal for the next lieutenant. In the books, it is also shown that Bianca loves her younger brother Nico very much, but is tired of caring for him all her life, leading her to join the Hunters in a heartbeat. When Bianca first joined the Hunt, Percy was a little annoyed and shocked as Bianca had a little brother who couldn't join the Hunt. Later, Percy realized and accepted Bianca's motives after she told him that she joined the Hunt so she could live her own life and not be Nico's "babysitter". She also told Percy that she felt okay, leaving Nico at camp, because she figured if there were more people like Percy at camp, Nico would be fine. During this conversation. Percy describes Bianca as more confident, she keeps her hair up and back in a braid, she doesn't cover her face with her green cap, and she looks you in the eye when talking, all which she acquired after joining the Hunt.

   Bianca di Angelo's fatal flaw may have been holding grudges, like Nico's. After her death, Bianca says that holding grudges are very dangerous for children of Hades. Bianca's flaw could also have been personal loyalty or having a much too strong bond with those she loves, such as her brother. This may be because Bianca was killed when she picked up a
   Mythomagic
   figurine of Hades, the only Mythomagic figure Nico didn't have, an act of misplaced sibling love.

   , Bianca is described as having “olive skin and silky dark hair”, a trait she shares with her younger brother Nico.  Percy also notes that she was wearing a floppy green cap that constantly got in her face.  After joining the Hunters of Artemis, Bianca abandons her green cap and pulls her hair back into a braid in a fashion similar to Zoe. It is then revealed that Bianca has a splash of freckles across her nose.  She also wears silvery clothes like all the other Hunters. Because she joined the Hunters, Bianca’s skin faintly glows silver, as if she had been “taking showers in liquid moonlight”. According to Percy, Bianca looked like she had been working out, which may indicate that she had become slightly muscular after joining the Hunters. It is also stated that Bianca bears a strong resemblance to her mother, Maria, as the two have the same smile.

     Nico and Bianca shared a very close relationship. When they were younger they were inseparable, chasing each other in the front of a hotel as Hades and Maria talked. As their mother died when they were young, Bianca assumes an almost motherly role, bearing the responsibility that a parent would normally bear. Bianca was very overprotective and close with Nico, and Bianca tended to argue with Nico a lot and get annoyed, like when they were arguing at the
     Westover Hall
     school dance, waving their hands. And when Nico said it was cool when he found out they were demigods, Bianca said it was not cool and that they weren’t demigods. Bianca also tends not to believe Nico, like when he said when a bus driver had thorns. However, Bianca deeply loved Nico and said he was the only family she had left, feeling alone. Nico also loved Bianca, clinging to her and telling her that he was scared when the

     kept attacking them. Nico also stood up for Bianca when he called her an Insufferable girl. It is mentioned that Bianca was strict at the movies she let him watch. The two did have happy memories together, like Nico and Bianca walking through the National mall in Washington D.C in the 1940s.

     would care for him. Bianca talked to Nico and told him that she was joining, and Nico became very mad and grumpy at Bianca for leaving him. While on the bus back to Camp, Bianca whispered something in Nico's ear, but he scowled and looked away. However, Nico still had a love for Bianca left, and he told Percy to join the quest to protect her and made him promise to. On the quest, Bianca confided in Percy that she loved Nico but she wanted to know what It’d be like to not be a big sister 24/7. But Bianca proved that she still cared for Nico when she died trying to get a gift for Nico in
     Junkyard of the Gods
     , the only Mythomagic figurine he didn’t have. She then told Percy to give it to him and tell Nico she was sorry.

     When Percy returned, Nico immediately asked him where Bianca was. When Nico found out she was dead, he threw her figurine on the ground and took all of his anger from Bianca onto Percy, and ran away from camp in tears. Nico mentioned that he also had nightmares of Bianca, and could feel her being judged in the
     Fields of Asphodel

     When Bianca appeared to Nico, Nico was excited to see her, and her face was sad, like she was dreading this for a long time, and told Nico that he had gotten tall. Nico questioned why she hadn’t answered him and she said he hoped he would give up, making Nico’s heartbreak. Bianca told Nico not to try to save him and that Percy is right, putting her hand on his face. Bianca told Nico that he must forgive Percy, and that grudges are fatal flaws for children of Hades, and that he must promise her. She then told him to admit that he was mad at her, not Percy, and he was mad at her for abandoning him to join the Hunters, and she apologized for that. But she said he must overcome the anger. Nico was still in denial though, wanting his sister back. Bianca then started to tell him that if he loved him, to not bring her back, but then she said that Tartarus was stirring and that she must leave. Nico didn't want her to leave, but Bianca said she loved him and remembered what she said. Nico cried that night about the exchange and was jealous of Percy that Bianca summoned him, but gave up on trying to get her back. After the

Nico said that he knew that, and told Bianca to stop trying to protect her and that he wasn't the same as he was before. Bianca told him he didn't understand, but Nico brushed her off and put his hand through the mist, making her disappear. Nico also has a bit of self-hatred for not being Bianca, when Hades says she should have survived, not him. Nico later mentions that he had seen her spirit a few times in the
