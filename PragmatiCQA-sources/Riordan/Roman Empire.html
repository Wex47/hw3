   that emerged in the area now known as Italy, a country in southern Europe. Its first emperor was Augustus, the grandnephew and adopted son of Gaius Julius Caesar. Julius Caesar became official dictator of the Roman Republic after he defeated Pompey the Great and the "Republican" faction of the Senate in a civil war. After Caesar's assassination in March 44 BC, Rome would be furtherly divided internally, with this second period of political instability culminating in another civil war, in which Augustus would emerge victorious.

They waited on their hills for an omen from the gods, Romulus saw more birds and decided to build his city there. Remus, angered by this, mocked his brother's walls by leaping over them. Romulus killed his brother in a fit of rage and the city of Rome was founded in 753 BC.

They gathered the youth of Collatia to Rome and all voted for the deposition of Tarquin the proud, the comitia curiata approved of this using the treatment of the king's wife, Tullia, as an example. Everyone agreed with Brutus that Rome would be better off without kings, so the Tarquin family was prevented from entering and exiled and the Roman Kingdom became the Roman Republic.

   While the fall of the last king had established Rome as a republic, the Senate was largely controlled by the patricians, or the rich upper class nobility. The lower class of plebeians left Rome twice in protest against the patricians' unfair rule in a series of events called the Secession of the Plebs. In response, the position of Tribune of the Plebs would be established to give the people a voice in Rome's politics. This Tribune was given the ability to veto the decisions of the consuls and the other magistrates, as well as call the Senate to meet. The

   ("Assembly of Centuries") elected the consuls to be the leaders of the Roman Republic for one year. Unlike Camp Jupiter, the Roman senate and military tops were actually the consuls, who held power over the praetors. The Roman senate and people elected 2 consuls to command the main armies of the republic.
The first conflict that was known was the Samnite wars. It encompassed giant armies being surrounded, crushing defeats on both sides and an intervention that did nothing but just annoyed the Romans with another easy task to face. The first and second wars ended with Roman victories. The majority of battles was won by Rome and they lost a few minor battles and one major one at the Claudine Forks.

   In 295 BC, the consuls Publius Decius Mus and Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus destroyed a combined army of Etruscans, Umbrians, Samnites and Senone Gauls. In the battle, Rullianus fought defensively, using different counterattacks and feigned retreats. His colleague, Decius, had fought aggresively, making two cavalry charges but on the third one, they charged too far and were surrounded by Gallic cavalry and chariots. His cavalry ran back into the infantry, causing mass chaos and even causing some casualties by friendly fire. Publius decided that it was time to devote himself, he shouted at the top of his lungs, so that all the soilders can hear. "I carry before the gods terror, rout blood and carnage. I will infect their standards, armor and weapons with dire and manifold death!". With that, he charged into the Gallic lines and was instantly slain by some spears. The angered soilders advanced right into the fray of the fighting, pushing the Gauls back. Quintus Fabius sent three of his reserve maniples, led by Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus's great grandfather. This rebalanced the battle and Quintus Fabius sent his cavalry sweeping in onto the Samnite lines on his side, causing a lot of casualties. Quintus Fabius then learned of his colleagues' death and sent the princepes of his second legion to surround the Gauls. The Gauls were slaughtered and the battle was over. The Romans lost 8,000 men and the Allied army had more than 22,000 casualties. Five years later, another Roman consul won the battle of Aquilonia and defeated the Samnites once and for all.

   By 280 BC, Rome's borders had encompassed the whole of modern Italy, excluding Sicily and Sardinia. The emerging superpower soon found itself in conflict with the other Mediterranean superpower at the time, Carthage. The first war, based on Sicily, was the turning point for naval warfare. The Romans used a mighty fleet of 1000 galleys to destroy numerous smaller Carthaginian fleets, culminating at the battle of Ecnomus. In the battle, republican warships defeated the Carthaginians and following this, Rome was unchallenged in the mediteranean. In the second one, Hannibal won the battle of Cannae, drawing the Romans into the centre to deliver a devestating blow to the flanks and rear. At Ilipa, Baecula and Zama, Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus destroyed the Carthaginians using similar tactics of Hannibal. In the first two, Scipio caused more than 100,000 casualties and at the final showdown at Zama with Hannibal, he caused 40k casualties. At Zama, the Roman infantry held the line  while the cavalry sweeped the Carthaginian cavalry from the field tirelessly, only to deliver a finishing blow to the rear and flanks to Hannibal's army. Rome had effectively controlled the sea with a fleet greater than the combined might of the Greek city-states and they now turned their vengeful gaze to the east, where various Greek city-states had allied with Hannibal Barca, a brilliant Carthaginian general.

   In 197 BC, the Romans defeated the Macedonians and the whole greek armies at the battle of Cynoscephalae, which showed the Legion's supremacy against the phalanx of Leonidas and Alexander the Great. It showed the flexibility of the maniple over the phalanx and Roman cavalry against Greek cavalry. Rome was now technically reigning supreme over the meditation but there was one more threat, the Selucid Empire, ruled by Antiochus the Great. The following battle of Magnesia showed the Legion's supremacy over the phalanx once again and Roman cavalry against more technologically advanced Seleucid cavalry. In the battle of Pydna, Roman forces led by Lucius Amelius Paullus Macedonicus scored a descive victory over Perseus, king of Greece. Before the battle, the moon turned red. Had Zeus abandoned the Greeks? In the ensuing battle, the legion used some tactics used by the Roman consuls at Asculum, overwhelming the phalanx while the Roman cavalry carved a bloody swathe through the Thracian skirmishers and Greek cavalry. After the legion defeated the phalanx, Perseus fled. The Macedonian kingdom was forever gone and all the Greek city states would be defeated, even Sparta and Athens, at the battle of Corinth.

   Rome also swept into the Asia Minor, also destroying Greek colonies such as Pontus. Humiliating them in the battles of Charonea, Orchemenus and Cyzicus. While also beating Armenia at Tigranocerta, Pontus’s most powerful ally, forcing Tigranes the great, who was a relative of the Pontic king Mithridates VI, to be a Roman vassal in order to stop it being completely conquered. The terms of the following peace treaty was that the Romans gained upper Mesopotamia, Syria, Lebanon, Upper Arabia, Selucia, Judea and many more others. In the few battles, more than 200,000 Pontics and Armenians were killed and dozens more were wounded, captured or missing. Rome captured Sinope , Ephesus and Smyrna in quick succession.

   While the Republic had nearly doubled in size following the second war with Carthage, its economy had been severely weakened by the conscription of farmers. There were social and political crises. The brothers Gracchi tried to remake the distribution of land but were killed by the patricians. The general Gaius Marius made the Marian reforms in order to combat a Germanic threat and he defeated them outright at the Battles of Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae (102 and 101 BC) . In the two battles, more than 200,000 Germans were killed by Marius, Manius Aquilius and Caius Catalus Lutatius. The battles were easy for the Romans since they had superior infantry and cavalry and gained the upper hand almost immediately after the battles commenced, throwing their two pila and drawing their gladius. However, the following consul, Sulla, capitalised on the political turmoil in Rome itself and marched on Rome with six legions, gaining dictatorial powers soon after and he initiated a purge of the popular party, the list encompassing the young Gaius Julius Caesar. Rome's armies were no longer tied to the state, but rather, to the general that paid them and gave them land. The final nail in the coffin was Caesar's decision to cross the Rubicon and initiate a civil war which would see him installed as

After the Parthian victory at Carrhae, the Romans avenged with the battles of the Cicilian Gates, Amanus Pass and Mt Gindaurus, where the Roman general Publius Ventidius Bassus killed the Parthians, with two large parthian armies gone and most of the nobility were killed, including a Prince, at Mt Gindaurus. Caesar’s dictatorship, combined with a corrupt senate, and generals controlling their own personal armies, lead to the eventual fall of the Republic at the hands of the First and the Second Triumvirate.

   Upon Caesar's assassination on the Ides of March (15 March) 44 BC, his will was read, where it was revealed that he had adopted Gaius Octavius, his grandnephew, as his son and heir. Taking on the name Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus, the young heir soon made his way to Rome in July 44 BC, where he formed the Second Triumvirate, which consisted of himself, Marcus Antonius (Caesar’s former consul and confident as well as a former husband of Cleopatra), and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (a Roman patrician and military commande). They ultimately defeated Caesar’s assassins, but disputes between Octavianus and Antonius (who had allied himself with Queen Cleopatra VII of Egypt) lead to another civil war, with Octavianus emerging victorious. Following Antonius’ suicide in the aftermath of the Battle of Actium (2 September 31 BC), Octavianus returned to Rome triumphant. There, he was welcomed by the citizens of Rome and honored by the Senate, which was an empty shell of its former self (filled with pro-Octavian supporters).

   Before the Pyhrric war, the Samnite wars, Etruscan wars, Umbrian wars and wars with the senone gauls. By 280 BC, Rome's borders had encompassed the whole of modern Italy, excluding Sicily and Sardinia. The Magna Grecia territory was taken by Rome after landing a few severe blows to Pyhrrus of Epirus at Hercelea, Asculum and Beneventum. Carthage was taken by the senate together with Spain and a part of northern Africa. The commander Scipio Africanus took Hispania, Quintus Fabius Maximus cuncator retook great cities like Tarentum easy from Hannibal, Scipio defeated Hannibal at Zama even though he was numerically inferior and was facing the infamous war elephants of Carthage. Greece was easily conquered except for a few struggles such as Cynoscephalae and the First Macedonian war where Phillip V tried to kick Rome while Rome was tied down by Carthage. They managed to conquer Greece by defeating each seperate city state piecemeal, one at a time using their superior numbers to hold off allies. This was the order: The Romans defeated powerful states such as Macedon and Athens, then fought the combined army of all of the city-states at Scarphiea and Corinth. This culminated at the great battles of Cynoscephalae (legion vs phalanx), Pydna (legion vs phalanx) and Corinth (joke). During the Republic, Rome annexed the Ptolemaic Kingdom took Egypt and Gallia (France) and Jerusalem was taken by Pompey. During the time of the empire, every emperor extended the boundaries of the empire until the boundaries had been stretched far, from Britain in the north, Spain in the west, North Africa to the south and to the Middle East to the east. Armenia, Dacia and Mesopotamia were dominated by Trajan and Britain by Claudius. Hadrian would evacuate Mesopotamia and Dacia; future emperors would struggle to hold on to the territories of the empire, occasionally losing and then retaking them. Rome would also be subjected to many civil wars, which devastated the empire and weakened its garrisons.

   The Roman Army was mostly infantry based, with the cavalry made up almost entirely (if not completely) of auxiliaries from across the empire or without. Obviously it was very variable and changed due to the time, the enemy, the strategy, the general and also due to the terrain. They tended to stay together and there aren't many examples of a Roman army split in half, at least not that they wanted to do so. The variations below were the more "classical" ones. A variation of the first and the second formations were used in the famous and remarkable victory against Boudica in Britain.  The hammer and anvil tactics used by Caesar, Scipio, Paullus and Germanicus at Idistaviso proved to be one of the most deadly tactics in Roman history. Roman generals would use a feint or set a trap in the opening of a battle and they would throw their two pila, causing enemies to flee the action and incumbering their movement. They would draw their gladius and try to stab into the enemy or use their shield to bash the enemy, normally right in the face, dealing massive damage. The Roman commanders after Scipio Africanus would try to smash the flanks of the enemy before wheeling onto the enemy at a massive offensive with the center included. Unlike Greek commanders, the Roman commanders would not engage in combat but they would sit on their horse near the back line, carrying runners out to deliver orders or tactical maneuvers.

   In the mid-republic, the Roman military included Velites, which were light skirmishers, Hastatii, which were the inexperienced but mighty soldiers, Princeps, which hard-hit Carthage and the Greeks and finally the Triarii, the revered veterans who literally bashed Hannibal at Zama, winning the battle on the flanks with a numerically inferior numbers. It was organised into maniples- groups of 120 men. The Roman army can enlist more than 700,000 men at its height after the Punic Wars.  These legions could easily crush a Greek phalanx with its superior mobility, hand-to-hand fighting skills, techniques, coordination, speed and quality. The power of the empire depended on the might of its professional armies. Therefore, the Roman Army was divided in legions. Every legion was composed of ten cohorts (the first being the most prestigious one, then the second and so on) that were each composed of six centuries of eighty soldiers (and twenty non-combatants). Roman legions were often outnumbered in battle but they normally gained victory. Later on, the Augustan reforms had doubled the size of the first cohort. At the height of its power, Rome had more than 1 million soilders that they can call on. Normally the commanding officer of the first century commanded the entire cohort. This totalled to be approximately 4800 that were under the command of a general (sometimes more than one legion was commanded by one person, depending on the amount of imperium the general had). Almost every emperor was a general. They only commanded big campaigns or tough battles leaving the "normal" ones to their generals. The emperor Aurelian was an exception to this. He commanded in every single campaign he went for, from Zenobia to Tetricus and from the Jugunthi to the Vandals. At its prime, Rome was an unstoppable force of numerous legionaries- battle hardened and experienced- with generals such as Scipio Africanus, Gaius Laelius, Gaius Marius, Lucius Cornelius Sulla and Lucius Licinius Lucullus. A special trait to the army was that- they fought to the end, no matter what the circumstance and always never surrendered, replacing lost armies with fresh talent. The Second Punic war was a show of this mentality. They had disastorus defeats at Trebia, Trasimene and Cannae but they just kept on replacing their armies with new and bigger ones until Scipio Africanus destroyed armies in Spain and Hannibal was forced to return to Africa after the Hasdrubal Gisco's defeat at the Great Plains and Numidian king Syphax's defeat at Cirta.

    Tiberius

   - One of Rome's greatest generals, he expanded the northern frontier of the Roman Empire and conquered Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia and temporarily, Germania. His wife was a woman named Vispinia whom he fell in true love with, but Augustus forced him to divorce her to marry his own daughter, Julia. Tiberius did not have Augustus' natural rapport with the Senate, he heavily relied on the brutal head of the Praetorian guard, Sejanus. Infamous for supposedly orchestrating the exile and death of Germanicus, his nephew and designated heir. Retired to Capri and had Sejanus executed for trying to seize power. Was killed by Sejanus' replacement,
   Naevius Sutorius Macro

His rule is considered the end of the Crisis of the Third Century. He infamously won the battle of chalons and defeated numerous Germanic tribes like the Jugunthi in numerous battles such as the Battle of Paris where he annihilated the whole Germanic army facing him at the classic site of the Metaurus. He later planned to launch an expedition into the Sassanid empire. However, unluckily for the empire, Aurelian was assassinated in 275 AD, this was the end of a great emperor  who reunified the Roman Empire and brought great glory to the Augustan Roman legion. This was the end of the unstoppable Roman legions and Diocletian would reform the legions into a Greek hoplite style force which was totally ineffective against threats like the sassanid empire and the Germanic tribes.

   As the barbarians closed in on the Empire it was split into the Eastern and Western Empire (the Eastern Empire was by far, more rich but the Western was more militarily better but it was led by dumb Emperors). Later emperors would reunite the empire but their efforts proved to be in vain. The Western Roman Empire collapsed in 476 as the last emperor, Romulus Augustus, was forced to abdicate to the Germanic warlord Odoacer on September 4. Although the name

   The Roman Empire, before the division between the western and eastern empire, was threatened by enemies, but every time the Romans cleaned up and things came back to "normal". Nevertheless, the "last fall" of Rome occured in 476 AD, when the last Roman emperor Romulus Augusulus was deposed by a Germanic chieftain named Odoacer. This marked the fall of the Roman Empire in the west. There were many reasons for its fall but the majority of them can fit into these three categories:

   <b key="b399a286-ac19-4924-8070-e4299246fff3">
    Military reasons:
   </b>
   The Roman Empire was too big to be properly defended. Of course, it was attacked many times but when barbaric tribes felt Rome was weak they simply went to get it all. Iranic, Celtic, and especially Germanic tribes were invading the Eastern Roman Empire and the Romans didn't have enough soldiers and strength to defend the borders. The Romans recruited many soldiers from outside Italy into the army but their loyalty was dubious. Loyalties aside, the leaders of these foreign troops often had their own agendas and especially during the late Western Roman Empire, they would act only if it benefited them and their people.

   <b key="5a2327bd-c714-41da-9a54-ca65f5157f2f">
    Economic reasons:
   </b>
   There were many problems in Rome. Their production system based on slavery was collapsing since they hadn't dominated other territories nor slaves. Many Romans had to pay huge taxes that hurt the economy and trade. Rome wasn't the largest city in the west and its importance to Europe's economy was falling. Other cities, mainly Constantinople, were becoming more attractive to make business and were becoming capitals of growing empires. Rome also faced many recessions, brought on by civil war and chronic overspending (especially on the army).

   <b key="7b681b71-aae5-43c5-a7eb-8f4aaf302f1f">
    Political reasons:
   </b>
   One of the main reasons for the fall of the Western Roman Empire is that Rome could not find a new leader to rule the empire. Emperors were overthrown before they could take full control of the Empire. Another reason for the Fall of the Western Roman Empire is that diseases killed many Romans and affected the population and Rome's morale. The political instability (especially during the
   Third Century
   ) and ineptitude of some (if not many) of the later emperors would lead to the downfall of the Roman Empire (at least, in the west).
  </p>
  <p key="422ea437-6963-4969-9171-86a767c60fa8">
   All those factors culminated in the fall of the Empire and it's considered today that none of them alone could have caused as much damage as they did together.
