   Julius, as a descendant of one of the most ancient magician families, is very skilled with

   . It is unknown where his original specialty lied in, but he was able to release a total of five gods with a single Divine Word and has a vast knowledge of Ancient Egypt, it's mythology, and its gods. He mentioned that Amos could never defeat him in a duel so it is likely that he would have become Chief Lector after Desjardins died had he not become a host for

   . However, since Julius and Amos had not seen each other in a long time, it is also possible that Amos had gotten better since then. Julius is also an
   Animal Charmer
   as he was able to transform his staff into a giant snake. However, since he had not become the Eye of Osiris, Set was able to easily subdue him. After merging completely with Osiris, Julius' specialty in magic is
   necromancy
   and
   Death Magic
   .

   Julius dearly loves his daughter and greatly values the two visitation days he is given per year. He fought very hard to keep her in his custody before the Per Ankh intervened. After the case was closed, he asked Bast to protect her by masquerading as her pet cat,

   Like Sadie, Julius deeply loves his son his but has been more strict with him as well. Needing to keep Carter safe, Julius demanded obedience and taught him the ways of the world, warning him of the prejudice he may experience simply for being of African descent. Carter would often try to please his father by sharing the same interests, hoping to earn his approval.

   Although details are scarce, Julius has a good relationship with his brother. They clearly care for each other as Amos attempted to talk his elder brother out of summoning Osiris for fear of his life and Julius passed along kind wisdom to his younger brother after his possession by Set. Like most brothers, they were said to argue frequently.

   Julius loved his wife very much. Her death had greatly hurt him and also plagued him with guilt. After becoming Osiris' host in the Underworld, Julius brought Ruby's spirit to his court which seems to have given a great deal of joy and peace to him.

   Julius became then the eye of Osiris the god of underworld. He was known as Julius Kane and Osiris, in other words, he was
