I woke up every day expecting to be assassinated, just like the rest of my family. I became a consummate actor. Whatever Tiberius needed me to be, I was. And I survived. But you? Your life has been golden from start to finish. You don’t have the stamina to be mortal.

   Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus was born on the day before the Kalends of September in the year 12 AD under the consulship of his father Germanicus and Gaius Fonteius Capito. His mother was Agrippina, the granddaughter of the first emperor, Augustus. By the age of three, he began accompanying his father Germanicus on the general's military campaigns. He received the cognomen "Caligula" jestingly from the legionaries, for he was raised amongst them and dressed in the garments of a soldier, including in a type of footwear called

   Caligula's father later died while on a campaign in Syria, on which he had accompanied him; the rumor was that it was by the treachery of Tiberius, under the supervision and aid of Gnaeus Piso, who at that same time was governor of Syria, and who, believing it necessary to find fault with the father and the son as if it were plainly the only thing to be done, had assailed Germanicus with bitterness and harshest of words and deeds, even when the general was ill. Whence returning Caligula first lived with his mother, then, with her being banished he stayed in the home of his great-grandmother Livia. After she perished, he went to his grandmother Antonia, and at nineteen years of age he was summoned to Capreae by Tiberius. On that same day he accepted the toga of manhood, although without ceremony.

   Here, although he was prodded by all sorts of trickery of those attempting to entice him or drive him to complaint, he never allowed them, ignoring the destruction of his family as if nothing had befallen to anyone. Still, he could not keep in check his cruel and vicious nature, in that he would attend most eagerly the chastisement and torturing of those who were to be punished, frequent cheap dining houses and brothels and night while disguised under a wig and long cloak, and lustfully seek scenes of dancing and singing; Tiberius was very patient with him, if only in order tame his fierce nature.
  </p>
  <p key="41b73791-1234-4672-ac95-2b85c0a534ad">
   Not long after, he married Junia Claudilla, the daughter of the well-known nobleman Marcus Silanus. Since the court was vacant and Sejanus, a close friend to Tiberius, was suspected of being an enemy and thus removed, he was impelled little by little to the hope of being successor. In order to strengthen it, after Junia was lost in childbirth, he began to seduce Ennia Naevia, the wife of Macro, who then was a prefect of the praetorian cohorts, and promised their marriage if he obtained the empire. Having become friends with Macro through her, he either killed Tiberius with poison, as some say, and then ordered a pillow to be thrown over his face as he resisted or even suffocated him with his own hand.

   After he had entered the city, he was immediately given the right and sway over all things by a consensus of the Senate and of the crowd which was trying to break into the Senate-house, with Tiberius' will made vain, who in his testament had declared his other grandson to be co-heir. The people's happiness was so great that in the next three months approximately one hundred and sixty thousand animals are said to have been sacrificed. A few days later, after he had reached the islands nearest to Campania, prayers were made for his return. However, he soon fell ill, and during this time there were some that said they would fight or be killed themselves if but he could be healthy. There were also many foreigners who favored him in addition to the love of his citizens. While ill, he recalled many of those who had been banished by Tiberius, released many from whatever former charges they were accused of, and completed several unfinished projects, instituting a great number of games as well. During this time he was called "Pious", "Son of the Camp", "Father of Armies", and "The Best and Greatest Caesar".

   Yet soon, he began to join to himself a kind of divine majesty. He ordered that statues of gods either famous for their art or piety be brought from Greece, and after cutting off their heads he would place an image of his own upon them. Then he extended a part of his Palace to the forum, and with the temple of Castor and Pollux being transformed into its vestibule, he would often stand between the two gods, showing himself off as a deity to the passersby. He erected a temple for the worship of his own divinity and established his own priesthood and sacrifices. In the temple there stood a gold likeness of himself which was clothed every day in the clothes that he wore. He had both his grandmother and his brother killed as well. With all his sisters he made a habit of incest, one of whom he made heir to his property and to the empire. When she died he instituted a public mourning, in which bathing, laughing, and dining with one's parents, spouse, or children was a capital offense.

  <p key="56c492f6-210e-465c-8cfc-b4507ba94ef7">
   He became irreverent and unmerciful towards the Senate. He made some of the senators who had achieved the highest honors run beside his chariot for great distances while wearing togas, and wait on him with napkins at his meals. Others, even though he had killed them in secret, he would continue to summon as if they were still alive, and after a few days he would claim that they had died by suicide. He also removed the consuls that forgot to celebrate his birthday. When the price of animals for gladiatorial games rose, he would select criminals to be torn apart, and those who had sworn they would either fight or perish for him were forced to fulfill their oaths. He forced parents to attend their children's executions, after which he invited them to dinner in jest. He also did not allow anyone to be put to death except by the infliction of many small wounds, telling the executioners to "strike so that he feels he is dying".
  </p>
  <p key="08403f58-66e9-4097-b1c8-7c2c290ba68d">
   A phrase that he often repeated was: "Let them hate me, as long as they fear me".

   and some other gods disguised themselves to join. At the party Caligula exhibited his usual cruelty; this included having the tongue of a poet who wrote a satire about him pulled out, dipped in silver and displayed for all to see, and enslaving a senator after the man agreed to be his slave, believing that the emperor was commenting on his slave disguise. When he noticed Apollo dressed as a gladiator, the disguised god managed to amuse the emperor and earn a reward by playfully stabbing one of his praetorian guard with a fake tin blade and swearing to protect him.

   On January 24 in the year 41 AD, at around one o'clock in the afternoon, although unsure of whether he should rise and eat lunch, for his stomach being still full with the previous day's meal, he left his home at the persuasion of his friends. When in an underground tunnel, through which the path lay, famous actors summoned thither from Asia were being prepared to act a play, he suddenly halted in order to inspect them and to encourage them. Had the leader of the group not complained to be cold, he would have immediately returned and had the spectacle begin. Hereafter there are two versions of what happened: some say that Cassius Chaerea, a Roman soldier, struck him from behind in the neck with the edge of his
   gladius
   , as he was speaking with the actors, crying out "take this!", after which Cornelius Sabinus, a tribune and another of the conspirators, impaled his chest from the front. Some say that, after the crowd had been removed by the centurions who were in on the plot, Sabinus, in the manner of a soldier, sought the signal, and so when Caligula uttered "Jupiter", he said "take thus your doom!", and as the emperor glanced back he clove his jawbone with his sword. As Caligula lay upon the ground drawing in his limbs and crying out that he still lived, the rest killed him with thirty wounds, for all were raising the cry: "Again! Again!"

  <p key="77625f92-04f0-4dfe-b6a8-0e9c89a095e8">
   Caligula is considered one of the most (if not
   <i key="591acd58-980a-4aeb-b01a-34d1d551e596">
    the
   </i>
   most) malevolent Roman emperors in history. Indeed, he is so cruel and ruthless, that even his nephew Nero is said to fear him. Caligula shows little to no concern at all to his subordinates, regularly ordering the execution of anyone who displeases or fails him, Incitatus being the only exception, as he is the only follower whom the god-emperor views as an equal. He also kills any subordinates whom angers him whether it is be with bad news or other things.
  </p>
  <p key="0f189382-708c-477b-a21d-c4e987bd3104">
   Caligula is also extremely power-hungry, always seeking to achieve more power. Back to his reign as emperor, he would disguise himself as several major Olympian gods, such as
   <a href="Mars.html" key="c3f36d28-4f5b-4f4e-a619-96431a9cef47" title="Mars">
    Mars
   </a>
   , Jupiter, or
   Apollo
   , and he even gave himself the alias "Neo Helios", which meant "New Sun". His hunger for power made Caligula the first Roman emperor to ever try to become a living god, as he plans to absorb the power of Helios and Apollo in order to become the new god of the sun. Additionally, Caligula is extremely confident, showing no fear that the gods' wrath may fall upon him, even after he profaned a sacred temple of Castor and Pollux, and started to compare himself to the gods. In fact, Caligula has so much confidence, that even Apollo himself became intimidated by him. Caligula was also notorious for his pleasure barges that included huge floating palaces with bathhouses, theatres, rotating statues, racetracks, and thousands of slaves. Despite owning super-yachts, Caligula can't swim, but that didn't faze him.
  </p>
  <p key="56096ca5-53c5-445e-8abe-46dcac1f2577">
   Much unlike Commodus, Caligula is surprisingly patient, as he waited years for his uncle Tiberius to die until finally ordering him to be assassinated. He said he doesn't play games like him, he goes right for the kill, Commodus is more interested in a good spectacle. When confronting Apollo, instead of killing him and consuming his essence immediately, decided to instead take his time taunting Apollo and torturing Jason, Meg and Piper. When Flange came in with an urgent message, Caligula was at first willing to wait and hear the message later, until the pandos insisted that his message was of the utmost importance. However, Caligula's patience does have limits, as he grew tired of waiting for Tiberius to die, and demanded him to be murdered instantly.

   Caligula’s super yachts are all named after his favorite sister, Julia Drusilla. This shows that Caligula may feel some remorse for his deceased sister.

   Caligula was young, slender and lithe. He was handsome in a thin angular way, though his ears stuck out a bit too much and were too prominent. His smile was twisted and too thin, and his placid brown eyes that were too far apart had "all the warmth of a barracuda's".

   In Apollo's first dream, after Macro killed Tiberius, Caligula wore white robes and sandals. In Apollo's second dream, when Caligula pretended to be him, he was butt naked, painted in gold from head to foot, with a spiky crown of sun rays across his brow.
