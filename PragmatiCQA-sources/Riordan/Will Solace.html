Nico said they didn't have time for chitchat and when he began to suggest he shadow travel to the Romans tent, Will rejected it, and said that he cannot shadow travel. He said he could feel the darkness in him and he'd be in no shape for combat if he went to the tent. He said they can stop the Romans by sneaking around, but no shadow travel.

Will thanked him, saying six at once isn't bad, and Nico said next time he'd let them run him down. When Nico used his powers to summon skeletons from the underworld, he almost fainted before Will caught him. Will called him an idiot and said he cannot use his underworld powers, and when he said he was fine, Will insisted he wasn't. He put his arm around him and gave him healing gum to save him, and told him to not complain when he said it tasted like tar and mud. When Cecil came over, Will said that Nico will not be doing any Underworld magic. Nico quickly pushed himself off of Will when he realized he was leaning against him, and said he will do what he needs. Will rolled his eyes and called him Death Boy, which Nico hated.

He said no one at Camp had ever pushed him away, and that he pushed himself away. Octavian interrupted him and when he said Apollo showed him the future, Will became furious and said he was the son of Apollo, and called Octavian an anemic loser.

When Nico insisted they wouldn't want him there, Will said that he should help him out and said that Nico was a friendly face, shocking the son of Hades. Will called him dense and said he hoped he got over the nonsense of wanting to leave Camp, and when Nico said he was staying, Will was relieved, saying he was dense, not stupid. He then ordered Nico to spend three days in the infirmary with him starting now, since he can't do magic without almost dying, making skeletal butterflies flutter in his stomach. After Nico went to talk to Percy and Annabeth, he went back to Will.

They continue their playful banter with each other and are usually seen sitting close by, holding hands. In fact, Apollo claims that Nico and Will are so cute together as a couple, that it made him feel desolate, jogging his memories of the time he had spent with his mortal boyfriend
   Hyacinthus
   , one of Apollo's two all-time favorite lovers (the other being Daphne). Nico on his part is always ready to help and support Will, such as when he tirelessly helped him tend to wounded campers (notably
   Paolo Montes
   and
   Valentina Diaz
   ). Nico commented about Will staring at Paolo, but Will stated that it was nothing and that he was merely admiring how well Paolo's arms were functioning after surgery.
