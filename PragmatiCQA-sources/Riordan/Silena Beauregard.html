   while he was talking to Percy, and wished him good luck, calling him by his first name, Charlie, which no one did, and gave him a brilliant smile. Silena and Annabeth then eavesdropped on Charlie and Percy and followed them, and then Silena jumped out of the woods and scared Percy, with her sword drawn. Silena had pink and red armor and makeup to match, making her look like Guerilla Warfare Barbie. Silena and Annabeth tried to take Percy prisoner, until they realized that the

   were trying to kidnap Charlie.

   than Charlie, but Annabeth shook her by the shoulders and explained to her that if they tried to save him, they would’ve been kidnapped too, and they needed a lot of help to rescue him. Silena began to cry and say that Charlie was probably already dead, but Annabeth said he most likely had a half hour left. Silena sobbed more and said they needed to save him, and Annabeth told her to get a grip and that they would. Silena was amazed when Annabeth mentioned the legend of the bronze dragon, and insisted it was just a legend. After she told her, Silena wanted to activate it, because it would help them rescue Charlie.

   wanted Charlie to fix the dragon and unearthed it on purpose, making her choke up. After Percy complimented Annabeth, Silena sniffed and wiped her eyes, and called him sweet. Annabeth then told Selena to shut up and told her to hand her her dagger. When Annabeth fixed the dragon and it charged at Percy, Silena ordered it to stop, speaking with such command that the dragon turned to her. Silena told the dragon that they woke it to save the camp, and said that Charlie was in trouble, making the dragon listen to them. They shoved the dragon to the
   Myrmeke's Lair
   and Silena led the charge into there, which was the first time Percy saw a daughter of Aphrodite lead a charge. Silena was so determined on saving Charlie that she was uninterested in a room full of jewelry, another first for a daughter of Aphrodite. She was very happy when she found Charlie and tried to help him up, and dragged him through the tunnels due to his paralyzed legs. She also pleaded with him to save the dragons life after it almost died, for her. But when the dragon malfunctioned, Charlie defeated him, and Silena was very happy, giving Charlie a kiss on the cheek and fussed over his cuts and bruises.

   Silena admitted to Charlie that what he did was the bravest thing she saw him do, jumping on the dragon. When Charlie asked her out to the Fourth of July fireworks, Silena said she thought he’d never ask and said of course, and called him a dummy. The two then walked ahead, holding hands, and Percy and Annabeth gave them space. It is later revealed that Annabeth and Silena may have planned the whole thing just to arrest Charlie and Percy to keep them out of Capture the flag, but when asked, they just smiled, trying not to laugh. They won the game.

Drew cited two main points of contention in regard to Silena's choice of actions; Silena's former alliance with Kronos and because Silena fell in love and stayed in love.

As for Silena, she liked Charlie back and flirted with him before a game of Capture-the-flag. Silena and Annabeth plotted to distract Percy and Charles so Charles could ask Silena to the fireworks. When Charlie was captured by

After he was saved, Silena gave him a kiss on the cheek, fussed over his injuries, and said that when he defeated the dragon, it was the bravest thing she ever saw him do. Charlie then asked her to go to the fireworks, and Silena was overjoyed and accepted. After this, the two held hands and walked in front of Percy and Annabeth before Silena captured him.

His death was also the reason why Silena stopped spying for Luke, because Luke promised that he wouldn’t get hurt, but he did. When Silena died, her last words were calling out Charlie’s name, and it is revealed that he was waiting for her in

    Before Silena liked Charlie, she liked and befriended Luke. Luke was nice to her and she thought he was handsome and charming. Luke took advantage of this and manipulated Silena into helping him and making her a spy, and she said yes. He even gave her a bracelet with a charm of Kronos' scythe. However, Silena wanted to stop spying after awhile, but Luke threatened to tell the camp and said she was saving lives, and no one would get hurt. He also promised that he wouldn’t hurt Charlie, but that ended up being a lie when he died. Silena was extremely guilty for spying and hated herself for it, and wanted to make up for it.

     , Silena and Clarisse had become best friends after Silena gave Clarisse boy advice. Clarisse was very thankful and decided to become Silena’s personal bodyguard, constantly being by her side. Clarisse also spoke gently to Silena, something she barely did to people. Clarisse comforted Silena when Charlie died, and put her arm around her, saying she was going to get hot chocolate to calm her down. Later, in the war meeting, Silena sat next to Clarisse while Clarisse argued with

     about the
     Chariot
     . Clarisse said she was only at the war meeting for Silena and apologized to her for arguing about stupid things, but refused to apologize to anyone else. Silena later tried to convince her to help them, to no avail.

Clarisse was devastated when she found out Silena pretended to be her in battle and asked why, and Silena said it was because they would only listen to her, and told her not to be angry at her siblings. Silena then confessed to Clarisse and the others that she was the spy. Silena died with her head in Clarisse's lap, and Clarisse sobbed. Clarisse said that Silena was a hero, and that
