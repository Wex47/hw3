   He also decided to add the Roman gods after many readers requested for Riordan to write a new series on them, who were actually just the Greek gods with Roman names and slightly different personalities. After such requests, he began to think how the Roman aspect of the gods would be after moving from Greece to

The wind spirit shakes her off, and she falls into the canyon. Hedge is taken instead, and both the wind spirit, Hedge, and the storm disappear. Jason then saves Piper by diving into the canyon and using his sudden abilities to control the winds to bring them back to the skywalk.

This gives Chiron some clues as to who Jason is, but he does not voice aloud these thoughts. At that moment, Rachel and Annabeth enter the room, stating that Piper is in a weak state.

As Piper has contracted hypothermia, Thalia asks the remaining Hunter to take care of Piper and the satyr, leaving her with Jason and Leo, the latter being immediately attracted to her. Leo sense that the two siblings need to be alone and turns to leave, but Jason asks him to stay. Thalia grudgingly accepts his company.

He voices this out loud and says that perhaps Jason was a bridge between two places ― an exchange. As an exchange goes both ways, then the missing half-blood must be the one sent to the other side. Basing his thoughts from Jason's dream, he also says that Hera is kept in the Wolf House. He gets excited by these ideas that causes himself to burst into flames, thus melting the ice bridge while Thalia still has yet to cross it. Thalia tells them that the Hunters will go to the Wolf House and hold it while they rescue Piper's dad from the giant. She also says that Jason already knows where it is and that they'll meet again soon.

When they finally meet Aeolus, he turns out to be a weather reporter-type figure who gets his commands from the gods, and therefore his forecasts, from the gods. Because the gods are constantly changing their decisions, it causes Aeolus to do the same to his forecasts. The group concludes that because of all this chaos, Aeolus must be mad.
