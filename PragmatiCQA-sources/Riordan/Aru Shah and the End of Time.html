   is a twelve-year-old girl who lives with her mother, Dr.
   Krithika P. Shah
   , at the
   Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture
   . She is imaginative and has a habit of twisting the truth, a trait developed to cope with her mother's distant behavior and to fit in with other students at the elite Augustus Day School. While she is at home during the school break, her classmates—
   Poppy Lopez
   ,
   Burton Prater
   and
   Arielle Reddy
   —arrive at the Museum and discover that Aru lied about traveling to France with her mother. They record her on Burton's phone camera to expose her lies. Aru had told them truthfully about a cursed lamp—the
   Diya of Bharata
   —in the Museum, which, according to a Hindu legend, if lit, would awaken the
   Sleeper
   , a demon who will summon
   Shiva
   , the god of destruction, who will cause the end of the world. Unbelieving, Arielle dares Aru to light the lamp and prove it being cursed, lest they consider that the lamp is a lie too and circulate her video, upon which Aru does so. The lamp explodes with a bright flash of light, leaving Aru unconscious.

   When she awakes, Aru finds the entire room frozen in time, including her mother and friends. A talking pigeon steps out through an elephant statue's mouth and seeks to know the lighter of the lamp. Upon realizing that Aru lit it, he is disappointed and reveals that the

   because she lit the lamp. They are five brothers that waged war against their one hundred cousins and won, Aru is the first female incarnation of a Pandava, which the pigeon finds disapproving. It tells Aru that when one Pandava awakens, so does another and that they need to meet the other Pandava by traveling through the Door of Many. The Sleeper will stop time wherever he walks, and after nine days the Sleeper will reach Shiva who will perform the dance to end all time. When Aru inquires about his name, the pigeon asks her to call itself Subala, but Aru feels the name has too many syllables and plans to call him Sue, upon which it tells her that he is a male and Sue is a girl name, so she then calls him
   Boo

It's too dangerous for driving, the Sleeper is out there looking for the girls' celestial weapons to release the Lord of Destruction. They enter the Otherworld through its entrance portal by attempting to grab hold of an invisible doorknob and imagining its a string of hope. The guardian
   Makara
   of the Otherworld is revealed when many lights of moths luster against its crocodile-shaped body. After confirming the two are humans, it opens the gate to the Court of the Sky.

The pigeon introduces Aru and Mini as the incarnations of the Pandavas to the Guardians, but Urvashi refuses to believe this as the Pandava souls have lain dormant since the end of the Mahabharata War. When Aru tells them about the awakened Sleeper, Hanuman believes them and produces visuals on a screen, which show that both Aru and Mini's neighborhoods have been frozen in time, when the new moon comes this will be permanent. Aru inquires if anything else has happened, and Hanuman says that the mounts of the gods have gone missing. Urvashi realizes the Sleeper wants to cut off the gods' mode of transport, but still refuses to believe that Aru and Mini are the Pandavas.

The thing was a small turquoise goblet with a silver liquid, Aru drank from it then spat out a key of bones, the sip of old age. After placing it on the floor with the other two keys, they all transform into a door. Mini talked to the door saying they would like to go, to the Pool of the Past, after some hesitation the door let them in.

   Inside, Aru can hear the final words of people who died. The two meet the dogs
   Ek and Do
   (one and two in Hindi) who say they have to be dead to continue. Mini tells them she is the daughter of their ruler, Aru uses her ball to play catch with the dogs. With them distracted, the heroines go through a silver door. All around in blinding light, they witnessed how people died, they were in line for an office but Mini's compact proves that they all speak backwards. The sign said KARMA &amp; SINS, at the end of the line was a man with a bulbous nose and miniature versions of himself, he is not Dharma Raja, he is
   Chitrigupta
   who keeps a record of everything a soul had ever done. He says Yudhistira has never been a female before, but he and not even Dharma Raja could help them on their quest, gives them good karma (two tokens with mirrors) to get past the Halls of Death, a cookie that smell like books, soma so they won't get thirsty from the dead and a slim ballpoint pen.

   The halls of death had three arrow signs: TO DARE, TO DISTURB, and TO DEIGN. Mini doesn't think dare sounds heroic and disturb sounds like their doing the wrong thing. Deign means ‘to do something that one considers beneath one’s dignity’ but an invisible wall wouldn't let the girls go any other way. There are only

   Palace of Illusions
   made by the demon king Mayasura, it's giving them tests. After entering a mausoleum, the palace speaks to them. It doesn't believe their the Pandava brothers as they left their dream home, it shows them what each brother and their wife, Draupadi, liked to do by changing the scenery around the girls. The palace gives Aru a bow and arrow and sent fiery fireflies at her. She loses her arrow in forest, remembering the tale of Arjuna and the fish’s eye, Aru sense an Otherworld door and escape. Mini was arguing with a clone of herself, one of them vanished and the palace is now convince that they are reincarnated from Arjuna and Yudhistira. He is

Aru realizes that this whale is the location of the weapons, their poking antics reveal the true gifts as Indra's Vajra and Dharma Raja's danda. It was the orb and mirror the whole time, they were awakened when the sisters tried to save each other. The Vajra's true form was too heavy for Aru, but Mini used the danda (which she nicknamed "Dee Dee") as a walking stick. Aru wants to get out of this Kingdom of Death, death had some claim everywhere. They reach a group of ponds but before they could leave Aru hears her mother. After observing her grandfather talking to his daughter and her putting the away the Sleeper's diya in the Pool of the Past, Aru realizes her mother loved the Sleeper (whose real name is ​​Suyodhana) and that she was his biological daughter.

   The girls exit in the middle of the road. Meanwhile, general public mistake the supernatural happenings to be a disease called Frozen Syndrome. The girls only have one day left before the new moon comes, but they know how to defeat the Sleeper. They need to find a place he doesn't like, they decide to go back to the museum so Aru calls upon the animals of the gods she freed to take them there.

   Mini is amazed that this is the place where Aru lives. Her mother was still there, the two girls summon the Sleeper. Dozens of other demons show up before him. He's holding Boo in a birdcage. Mini sent out an allusion of Aru's mother, Boo escapes and the Sleeper gets trapped in a circle and gets attacked by the animals. The Sleeper disappeared into the walls and taunted Aru for being such a liar. In response, she uses Vajra to cut the chandelier down onto him. The demons have either fallen asleep or are currently out of commission, Aru transformed Vajra into a whip to get rid of the rest of them. The Sleeper breaks free and pins Mini and Boo to the wall, Aru had no choice but to surrender. The Sleeper grabs Vajra, he says he's killing her to

He loses Vajra and it returns to Aru, she has a vision where an older version of her with Mini and three other sisters have weapon, but then it seems like they would turn on Aru and attempt to kill her. Aru gets nauseous at this, the Sleeper says he is not an enemy and that she shouldn't kill her. Aru doesn't believe her father, she tries to kill him but he escapes.

   Aru starts crying about this "failure," she and Mini think it was the curse of Shukra. But time is restored because the Sleeper was not in the Kingdom of Death when the new moon arrived. Aru's mother and friends are freed, mother first because her friends were closer to the diya. Boo is still accepted despite the girls knowing what he has done in the past. Krithika allows Boo to be kept as a pet and Arielle, Burton, and Poppy awake. Using the pen Chitrigupta gave her, she blackmails them with their own secrets and they leave her alone. The palace of illusions says hello on a note Aru received from Chitrigupta.

   Then the story opens at the end of winter break. Aru Shah is invited by Arielle to a New Year’s party but she rejects it. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, for three hours, Aru and Mini learned war strategy from Hanuman, dancing and etiquette from Urvashi, and folklore from Boo. On Friday, after hearing an embarrassing story about Aru meeting the new boy at school, their first class was traditional dance (specifically, bharatnatyam) and etiquette with Urvashi. Hanuman’s strategy lessons were a lot more rugged, in the Night Bazaar and through a archway of chakora (moon bird) feathers was a canyon where the two are tasked to get a crown above it. While discussing with Hanuman about ways to get it, an alarm sounds and he tells them that something important has been stolen, something even the gods fear.

   The following Saturday, Mini is at Aru's house and Boo is telling them to practice. A wolf holding a golden bow steps out and transforms into a girl to sniff and disappears as a bird, after that the elephant statue blared the alarm. Aru then sees the new boy nearby,
   Aiden Acharya
   who actually witnessed what happened. Boo tells them she is the next Pandava, leaving the two horrified. But they are ready whenever evil strikes.
