   after they met in the outskirts of Los Angeles in front of a dragon's cave. Luke and Thalia make their way to Richmond, Virginia, in front of a statue of Robert E. Lee, following Amaltheia. Thalia explains that Amaltheia had raised Zeus when he was a baby. Luke questions Amaltheia's motives, but Thalia tells him that the magic goat leads her to good things, adding that Amaltheia led her to Luke, an oblivious comment on her part that makes Luke embarrassed. The goat then indicates for them to enter an old mansion across the street and the demigods head toward it as Amaltheia vanishes.
  </p>
  <p key="616625bd-de81-4e42-a0cc-a7f9f16f3761">
   Thalia asks Luke to do his 'thing', and Luke magically unlocks the door. Once they enter, the door behind them lock, trapping them inside. Thalia tries to escape by a window, but the drapes burn into her hand and try to suffocate her. Luke saves her with his golf club, and voice calls down the stairs and tells the demigods to run. Luke grabs Thalia and they enter the farthest left room up the stairs. There, they meet
   Halcyon Green

   . Luke notes that there are jail bars separating them from a monster. Hal informs them that the monster is called a
   Leucrotae
   , but the monster speaks for him. He says that he was born with the gift of prophecy, but Apollo warned him not to use his power. Hal states that he used his gift to save a young girl's life and she gave him a
   dagger
   as thanks. Apollo, however, took away his voice, trapped him in his childhood home, and forced him to wear the skin of Pythos, who use to guard the

   . A panel in the back opens and two more leucrotae join the first one. Hal tells the demigods that the leucrotae would feast on them by 7:03 pm, at sundown, and he would take their supplies. He continues to explain that the leucrotae can't be killed by any metal.
  </p>
  <p key="7c31ab34-576e-4430-a66c-afd88da95008">
   Thalia tells Hal to send the monsters away, and Hal reluctantly agrees. Luke and Thalia try to figure out a way to escape, but soon give up. Luke is tempted to feed Hal to the drapes but stops himself. Hal types on the computer to tell them that they can read anything they like except his diary. Thalia, frustrated, wonders why Amaltheia led them there. He assumed the two were there for the treasure and leads them to his room. There, he unearths a safe. Luke, using his powers of Hermes, manages to unlock the treasure: a bracelet. Hal exclaims that Apollo told him his curse would end when the owner reclaimed the treasure. Luke tells Hal that he should be able to see if they survive today, but Hal says he can't use his powers again. Thalia exclaims that the treasure must help kill the leucrotae but Hal sadly dismisses the idea. Luke decides to searchÂ for ways to kill the leucrotae on the computer, but fails.

  <p key="f04700e9-f545-4e79-ba6a-c1507a6810bf">
   Hal decides to read the future and turns to Thalia. He tells her that she'll survive, but sacrifice herself to save her friends,

   Aegis

   . As the hours pass, Luke wonders over his prophecy, but decides to focus on the task. Thalia unwires the computer to summon a catalyst. Hal takes Luke to the side and scribbles in his diary. He tells Luke to take the book and that it would help him with his choices. He gives Luke the dagger and offers himself as a sacrifice. Thalia unleashes the lightning and the Greek fire is ready in the jar. At 7:03 pm, the leucrotae start entering the room. Hal takes the jar and lures the monsters into the bathroom.

   Luke and Thalia run toward the panel as a leucrotae discovers the ploy. Hal unleashes the Greek fire as the demigods make their way downstairs, sacrificing himself to save them. Luke figures out the code word to activate the bracelet, Aegis. The leucrotae blindly launches itself onto the drapes and is consumed. The house explodes and the demigods wake up back with the statue. The house burns down as sirens echo in the distance. Luke grabs Thalia and they decide to head to the James River and restock on supplies. Luke promises Hal that he would fight back if the

The demigods decide to take her in, Luke gives Annabeth Hal's dagger, and promises her that he wouldn't fail her like their families had done to them. Back in the present, Luke finishes writing in Hal's, now his, diary while on guard duty. Thalia begins to wake up for her turn and Luke finishes writing.

   When Percy and Annabeth get there, they climb down a ladder into the sewers and find an underground cavern. There they meet Cacus and he tries to sell them watches and clothes, which Annabeth quickly notes are fake. When Percy asks for the caduceus back, Cacus claims he will figure out how it works and become the god of traveling salesmen, mostly by forcing
   George
   and
   Martha
   to listen to him. Annabeth and Percy go on the attack, with Annabeth stabbing him in the back of the knee and Percy stabbing his leg. However, Cacus backs her and Percy into a corner, destroysÂ Annabeth's shield, and is about to turn her to stone when George and Martha turn into a cell phone. They escape the cavern when Percy calls thousands of gallons of New York sewage to him and it pushes them to the surface, with Annabeth cursing Percy the entire time.

   Bunker 9
   . Leo explains that
   Buford
   , a temperamental walking table has fled from the cabin after being polished with Windex, taking along two syncopators vital to the ship's creation. Leo then reveals that a mixture of deadly fluids will mix in less than an hour and destroy the woods. Jason and Piper agree to help and the trio head into the forest. Leo then ponders about his seclusion in Bunker 9, instead of enjoying the camp and how fast Christmas has arrived. Jason finds tracks and as the three decide whether it is Buford's or not a

   drakon
   . Before Jason or Piper could help, the Maenads ask the drakon if it's Dionysus. It answers by attacking, but the Maenads rip the drakon to shreds. They then discover the trio's location and ask Leo the same question. Leo states that he is the wine god, and tries fruitless efforts to escape, but to no avail. Slowly, the Maenads figure out the truth and order their deaths. The three barely manage to escape to the
   naiad
   's brook where Piper informs them that they can't kill the Maenads, because they'll be cursed by Dionysus. Leo thinks of a plan and tells Jason to find Buford while he and Piper lead the Maeneds back to Bunker 9.

The demigod launches himself onto a disco ball as a golden net, made from Hephaestian netting, traps the Maenads. Piper reunites with Leo as the timer reaches two minutes.

   giving a speech in front of an audience. At the end of his speech, he asks the audience a question, and a

   Ms. Lamia
   , the host of his talk, congratulates Dr. Claymore onÂ the talk'sÂ success. Later the boy who asked the question gives him his address, hoping to get an answer to his question. That night, Dr. Claymore gets a mysterious call from the host asking for something the boy gave him. Claymore refuses and hangs up. When Claymore goes to sleep he has a dream vision of the boy talking to his

   sister
   is trying to kill him and he asks for help. His mother refuses to come between the children. Dr. Claymore tries to wake up from his dream but fails, the boy notices Claymore and is surprised. His mother tells him that she brought Claymore there. Claymore demands to wake up so the mother allows Claymore to wake up.

   In the morning Claymore dresses up casually but he also puts his 9 millimeterÂ in his pocket, just in case of crazy fans and goes to a coffee shop where
   Burly Black
   , the waiter, provides Claymore with his usual. Later the
   host
   from the last night's talk shows up and threatens Claymore. Lamia uses the mist to confuse Claymore. Claymore uses his gun on Lamia and he saw that Burly didn't notice the gunfire which he found odd. Lamia proceeds to attack him but Claymore keeps slowing her down by using his gun. Claymore finds out that Lamia is the daughter of

   and she is immortal. Claymore takes Burly's truck keys. Lamia burns down the coffee shop with Burly inside by using her spells. Claymore escapes and goes to the boy's address. He finds out that the boy's father was a mistform and the boy's name: Alabaster. Claymore also learned about the world of the

    In The Staff of Hermes, Percy's blessing from the Styx hardly makes a difference to their predicament. Percy acknowledges its existence but is for some reason unwilling to use it to get close enough to defeat the giant Cacus. When he is being hit by flames, Percy's body seemingly acts the same way he would if he did not have the blessing. This is similar to how his gift is treated in the story Percy Jackson and the Singer of Apollo, where Percy does not even acknowledge that he has such an advantage.
