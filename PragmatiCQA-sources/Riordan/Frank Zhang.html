Leo had given them a twenty-four-hour in advance warning when he landed, but the casualties were still heavy. Most of their dead had disappeared, and the Romans feared that their fallen would return and fight them with the hordes of Tarquin's undead. They arrive just as Tyson is getting lines of prophecy tattooed onto his skin by Ella, much to Apollo's shock.  As Ella recites a line of the books related to

Apollo then arrives and joins the fight, although Frank says he is messing up his plan and tells Apollo to run when he says to, then goes to continue his fight as Commodus engages Apollo, while both sides of the battle cautiously watch out of striking range. Frank and Apollo lure the god-emperors into the tunnel, and as the latter engages Commodus still, Frank and Caligula circle one another cautiously and strike. He turns into a swift and takes out one of Caligula's eyes; in response, Caligula swats the son of Mars onto the wall and, when he reverts to human form, stabs him in the back, a hit that would have been fatal had his cloak not protected him. As Caligula is recovering, Frank jumps up and pushes Caligula to the wall, choking him and making his face turn purple. He tells Apollo to run, and after reminding Caligula of his murder of Jason Grace, the son of Mars ignites
   his stick
   , triggering an explosion and encases them both in flames. Caligula is killed while Commodus is left severely injured, allowing Apollo to finish him off.

Frank is insanely loyal to his friends and cares about them deeply, like when he stopped Percy from his fatal flaw. As the series goes on, he even becomes reckless for his friends, like when he slammed a minor god into a wall for not healing Hazel and Nico fast enough. Frank is also a very good listener, listening to Coach Hedge when he confided about missing his wife and unborn child.

   , Frank has a lot of anger and rage inside of him. Frank can get very angry and irritated sometimes, making him huff like a bear. After his mom died, he was so furious that he destroyed his grandmothers fine China, even though he knew she may punish him. He also wanted to slam Nico into a wall in anger after he couldn't protect Hazel, letting her be poisoned.

   Frank used to be very self conscious due to being bullied when he was young by his grandmother and his peers and would hide his fat, being self conscious about his body. He had extreme self hatred and low self esteem, made worse by when he went to Camp Jupiter and thought he was unworthy to be in the legion. He thought it was a mistake that Reyna let him join and that he only messed things up. Due to this, he would be very awkward and nervous, like when he snapped crackers while trying to give them to Hazel. Even when he had accomplishments, he would feel unworthy, like when he was promoted to Centurion. His low self esteem got better at the end of

  </p>
  <p key="a6b0bc8e-6fe9-4f93-8000-d72f51c716e1">
   Another product of his low self esteem is fire. He would constantly worry about his lifeline once he found out about it and didn't tell anybody, other than Hazel, Percy, and eventually Leo and Nico. He developed a fear of fire, made worse when his grandmother may have died in a fire. He began to conquer it throughout the series though, like when he decided that Hazel would carry his lifeline and when he burned his stick to rescue

After receiving the Blessing of Mars in The House of Hades however, Frank "unleashed a hurricane of violence" and destroyed over a hundred Katoblepones single-handedly. In addition, he became even stronger. Strong enough to slam a full grown god to the wall, even holding him in a chokehold without allowing him to break out. Out of the Seven, Frank is probably the most physically strong. He is also very tall and muscular { he is 6'5 or 6'6 ft tall }

Frank has so far turned into an elephant, an eagle, a grizzly bear, a weasel, a seal, a dragon, a crow, an iguana, a snake, a koi goldfish, a dolphin, a gorilla, a bulldog, a rhinoceros, a swarm of bees, and a lion. After receiving the Blessing of Mars, Frank's shape-shifting becomes more fluid and less tiring, as he could begin an attack in human form and finish as an animal.

   , but both secretly had crushes on each other. Hazel heart skipped a beat every time she saw Frank, which irritated her because the entire camp teased her and said she and Frank should date, because they were the two biggest losers at camp. However, Frank was the only one at Camp Jupiter who was nice to Hazel and didn't treat her like a disease, which Hazel was grateful for but thought if he knew about her past, he wouldn't be as nice to her. As for Frank, he really liked Hazel and thought she was nice and good-looking. He was very attracted to her and wanted to put his arms around her and make her warm, and thought she always looked good. Hazel was Frank's only friend and he even almost told her about his firewood secret. Frank also was grateful for Hazel when she stood for

When Hazel got a blackout, Frank became very worried and panicked, and was relieved when she woke up. Frank was also worried that he never noticed her blackouts before and asked if it was for a medical reason, and held her hand, which surprised Hazel, but pleasantly. After Percy left to get food, Frank told Hazel that he realized she was born in a different time and was from the

Frank reassured Hazel that she was alive now, and intended to keep her that way. Hazel said she didn't deserve a friend like him, and Frank said she was a great friend and not the only one who had secrets. Before Frank could explain, Hazel was dragged away by

   As the quest went on, Hazel began seeing Frank as having more courage than she realized, and the one looking out for her, which was a nice change for Hazel, since usually she was the one looking out for Frank and keeping him out of trouble. Frank eventually encouraged Hazel to tell the story of her past, and that she shouldn’t carry her problems alone, but if she didn’t want to, it was okay. Hazel eventually told everything, except for Sammy, to Frank, Ella, and Percy, and Frank held her hand, saying that Hazel was brave and that he could never be as brave as Hazel. Hazel trusted Frank enough to pull him into one of her blackouts, and Frank saw where she went after death. As Frank and Hazel sat in the

Hazel would also talk to Leo and tell him that his fire made Frank nervous. The strain in their relationship ended after Hazel and Frank went to Rome with Leo, and Frank and Leo's relationship mended.

When Apollo and her are eating lunch, she's distracted and mumbles to herself about liking a guy with a death wish. She then tells Apollo how by talking to Frank he washed away her curse, which she sounded grateful for. Before Hazel goes on the quest with Apollo, she has a talk with Frank out of earshot. Lavinia says that they would be there for a while, because when those two start mother henning over each other, it could take awhile. Lavinia claims that if they could wrap each other in Styrofoam peanuts, they would. When everyone thinks that Frank died, Hazel is in another part of town, and doesn't know. When Apollo tells her after they kill a legion of zombies, she leans on Arion and cries, but has to quickly compose herself. She sends Arion to go find Frank's body and goes to fight Tarquin. After the battle. Hazel is scolding Lavinia about leaving her post when she sees Arion with a figure draped across his back. It's Frank. They rush him to the medics and it is shown that Frank is healthy. Hazel and Apollo are by his side when he wakes up. Hazel hugs him and cries. She proceeds to tell him how he scared her and gives him some nectar. She kisses him on the forehead and tells him he broke her heart. Fast-forward to the end. Hazel and Frank meet Apollo in a coffee shop before they have to rouse the legion. They leave hand in hand.

Frank replied, saying it was because shapeshifting is hard, like lifting weights. Leo said he wouldn't know, since he didn't lift weights, to which Frank began to respond, telling him he should consider trying it out. Shortly after, Hazel stepped in to cut off the argument. Frank also got angry at Leo when he didn't want to rescue Nico, taking it as a sign that Leo was skeptical of both Hazel and Nico's loyalty. In Atlanta, Leo embarrassed Frank when he teased him for not figuring out Chinese handcuffs, and he said he was worth at least two or three Franks when he and other members of the Argo II were wondering how much each of them would be worth. Annabeth later reassured Frank that Leo was nervous around him, and he was a good guy. Hazel also told Leo that Frank was nervous around him due to his fireballs, since Frank's main weakness is fire, due to his fragile lifeline depending on a piece of firewood.

Leo couldn't believe how much Frank had changed in the last few weeks, and thought he was more confident and more willing to take charge. He could barely see him as the the klutzy dude who couldn't get out of Chinese handcuffs just a few weeks ago. Leo and Frank went with Percy and Hazel to defeat

Frank cried and hugged both Leo and Hazel, which Leo was weirded out by. Leo asked if he was in agreement, and Frank said he hated the plan, but he would do it. The next day, Frank gave Leo the
