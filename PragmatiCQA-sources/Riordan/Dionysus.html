She disguised herself as an old woman (or as Semele's nurse in some stories) and made Semele begin to doubt that it was truly Zeus. While in disguise, Hera convinced Semele to ask Zeus to reveal his true form and, to make sure that he would do it, to have him swear on the

The next time Zeus visited her, Semele did as Hera advised, and though he tried to get around it, Zeus was bound by oath and so revealed to her his true divine form. Semele was burned to ashes, but Zeus managed to save the infant, and sewed him into his thigh. The child remained there until he emerged fully-grown a few months later, atop Mount Pramnos on the island of Ikaria. He was born a demigod, like

When Dionysus was three he was discovered by Hera who disposed of his guardians and their children by inflicting madness upon the household, him only surviving as Zeus turned him into a goat to hide him. The young boy was then taken to the rain nymphs of Mount Nysa; they raised him through childhood, and to reward them for their care, Zeus placed the nymphs into the night sky as a new constellation, the

   He was disguised as a mortal on the seashore once when a group of pirates spotted him. They thought he was a prince, and tried to kidnap him and hold him for ransom or to sell into slavery. They tried to tie his hands behind his back, but no ropes would hold him to the pole. At this point Dionysus turned into a lion and let a bear loose on board. It killed those it came in contact with, and those who jumped off the ship were turned into dolphins as an act of mercy. The only one to survive was the helmsman Acoetes, who had recognized him as a god, and tried to stop his comrades from the beginning.

   Dionysus is seen very briefly. He is mentioned early in the novel as being on a mission, checking up on all the minor gods and making sure they aren't going to join arms against Olympus. Later in the book, he enters Camp Half-Blood after the battle, looking very upset and just as angry, saying that he just learned his son
   Castor
   is dead (this may be the only time in the series when he's shown with sympathetic or sad emotions). He dissolves the committee, and later talks to Percy, saying Percy "always managed to annoy him". He tells Percy things are not looking good for Olympus, and that he supposedly should thank Percy and Annabeth for saving camp. He then shows Percy that he cured

   He is later seen at the end when he comments that Percy might not be so bad after all but was still going to make life difficult for him. He states that Percy probably saved the world through his expert training, for which the god was obviously responsible. He also adds that due to his bravery in the war, Lord Zeus had shortened his 'rehabilitation sentence' at Camp Half-Blood from a 100 years to only 50. This statement amused Percy and he tries to imagine what it would be like to put up with Dionysus for 50 more years (assuming he lived till then).

   Two months after the events of The Lost Hero, the Maenads, followers of Dionysus, found their way within the borders of Camp Half-Blood for the second time. They were looking for Dionysus. According to them, Dionysus had changed his number and his email as if he were avoiding them. Eventually they were captured thanks to the combined efforts of Leo Valdez, Piper Mclean and Jason Grace. Chiron mentioned that had the Maenads been killed, Leo, Piper and Jason would have been either forcibly destroyed or cursed forever by Dionysus. The Maenads were then sent off to Atlantic City.

   At first glance, Dionysus seems like a rather displeasing god. He enjoys calling people by incorrect names, especially

   , whom he often calls "Peter Johnson". He sometimes does this with campers who have been at camp for a long time, such as

   who he calls "Annie Bell" right after she was captured. He often does this to make the campers think that he cares so little for them, that he will make no effort to remember their names. He even refuses to acknowledge when he calls them by their correct names. This is also because he hates almost all heroes. His hatred for heroes stems back to how

   abandoned Ariadne, and thus is why he has the fewest shown demigod children among the major gods. He presented the exterior of a true misanthrope: cruel, intensely bitter, facetious and sarcastic to a fault. He also apparently has a catastrophic temper, as when he confesses himself to not be in a good mood whilst arguing with Silenus, all of the

  <p key="26aaad6b-dce7-4bd9-bc07-5456b2369efb">
   Dionysus doesn't like to be referred to as "the wine dude". The first time is when Nico called him that after the orientation video. Dionysus is not pleased but tones down his anger when Nico starts complimenting him in his excitement. The second time this happens is when Dionysus catches Percy as he chases after Zoë, Thalia, Grover and Bianca. Blackjack yells "God alert, it's the wine dude" and Dionysus becomes exasperated and threatens to stick the next person (or horse) who calls him that in a bottle of Merlot. He can also be quite unforgiving, as Chiron claimed that Dionysus viciously punished Seymor's previous owner for what he did to the animal, to the point that Seymor's current status (a discorporial head) is much better than the mortal's own.

  <p key="a452f6c8-cf1c-49c5-a202-b21430b77cfa">
   However, despite the impression he tries to give, deep down, Dionysus cares about his campers quite a bit. For example, while Dionysus stresses the fact that he cares little for the campers (except his own sons, Castor and Pollux) he dislikes

   due to his demeaning attitude and for treating the campers badly (even though he himself is generally disrespectful towards them), he finds humour in his attempts to grab food and is also happy to send him back to the
   Fields of Punishment
   . He is no kinder to

   , but never threatens him like he threatens the campers, and even admits he misses him during Chiron's exile from Camp Half-Blood (as he was fired by the gods). He asked Percy to look out for his son, Pollux, right after Castor died in the Battle of the

  <p key="c934f990-c112-4fff-bec1-3c71dcf96068">

   , and their friends, he used grape vines to kill the Manticore, Dr. Thorn, and caused several to descend into madness, saving Percy's life - he later coldly remarked that it was fun, hinting that he hadn't exerted himself in the act. Also, despite his rude demeanor, he tells Percy he is one of the nicest gods, as he had cured Chris Rodriguez from his madness when he came back out of the Labyrinth, in spite of having previously betrayed them. Both actions proved that he's much more selfless than he appears to be. In stark contrast to his gruffness and bitterness, Dionysus has been known to enjoy parties (likely because he is the

He is usually described as wearing tiger-striped (or leopard-spot) Hawaiian shirts and purple running shoes. He is described by Percy as a cherub who had grown up in a trailer park.

   Dionysus has also shown a surprising amount of loyalty to his marriage to Ariadne as in stark contrast to his fellow Olympians(excluding the Big Three and Virgin Goddesses) Dionysus has the smallest number of Demigod children, having only Castor and Pollux who themselves are twins, thus implying that he has only cheated on her once in the last few decades.

   when he asked him to look over his remaining son, Pollux, suggesting that Dionysus indeed cares for his children. He was obviously affected by Castor's death, being very depressed, and Percy stated that it looked like he was suffering more from grief than alcohol withdrawal at the time. In the Tower of Nero it is revealed that Dionysus actually Lived with Castor, Pollux and their mother for a while and enjoyed it. From that experience Dionysus told his brother Apollo that two is the perfect number because anymore and the kids start to outnumber the adults. It is unclear how long Dionysus stayed with the family or if Castor and Pollux had interacted with their father much while they were at Camp Half-Blood together. If they didn't interact much at camp that leads one to wonder if now that Dionysus didn't have their mother with them he felt outnumbered by the two boys.
