   As a child, Jason didn't remember much about his mother and Thalia, but he and Thalia were very close and would play hide and seek in his apartment. Beryl would try to tell Jason about his father, and showed him a storm at the beach, saying it was his father. When Jason was two, he tried to eat a stapler, in which he got his scar from. Jason was the only reason Thalia stayed home, because she thought he was cute.

   After Jupiter left Beryl and Thalia, Beryl became resentful of him leaving and began to act out again, resulting Thalia increasingly distrusting her ability to look after Jason. She blamed Hera for them leaving and claimed that she was going after them, saying that two demigods from one godly parent was an insult.

   One day, when Jason was two, Beryl took Thalia and Jason on a family vacation. She drove them up to Wine Country, insisting she wanted to show them a park. When they made it there, she showed Jason to a big building in the park and told Thalia to get a picnic basket. Thalia didn't want Jason to be alone with her, but she thought it would only be for a few minutes. Beryl wanted to stay with him, but Jupiter and Juno gave her no choice. When they made it to the

   , she hugged him for one last time in the ruins of the Wolf house, and promised that it was alright, she would come back and see him soon, with her eyes brimmed with tears. But Jason knew that it wasn't all right. Jason cried in the Wolf House waiting for Thalia and Beryl, but they never came. Instead,

   When Thalia found Beryl, she was sobbing at Stone steps of the Wolf House and said that Jason was claimed by Hera and left for dead, and was inconsolable for days. Thalia ran looking for him, but she couldn't find him. Thalia called the police, who questioned Beryl for a long time. Thalia and Beryl subsequently fought for a long time until Thalia ran away, now that Jason was gone. Thalia never learned the truth about her brother and thought he was dead until

   Jason was trained at the Wolf house by Lupa. She found him and tested him on his first night there, to see if he would be a pup or food. She took him under her wing, training him, protecting him and nurturing him, but he couldn't show weakness around her or else he would be torn to shreds - there cannot be weakness in the Wolf pack. She trained him and taught him things such as that he cannot fight force with force, something that helped him years later when fighting

   Eventually, Lupa took him on a trip south to Camp Jupiter, where she showed him around Camp. Jason was offered a place in the

   At Camp Jupiter, everyone expected Jason to lead and treated him like a prince in waiting. To try to alter it, he befriended the least popular kids and went on the least glamorous quests, but there was no use. He followed all the rules, but in reality, he chafed under the rules and traditions there, and felt a little unconventional. He also hated the infighting and the power plays there. He spent twelve years in the legion. Jason’s entire career at Camp Jupiter had been built on careful choices. He mediated between demigods, listened to all sides of an argument, and made compromises. He was always the leader and never on a team of equals.

   Diocletian
   and both shared an interest over him and his life. They made a promise that even though it was forbidden, if they ever crossed the Mare Nostrum, they would go to
   Dalmatia
   , where he lived. Reyna eventually developed feelings for him, and even though Jason knew he never shut them down, even though he never had feelings for her besides kinship. One time, Jason learned Reyna's last name and tried to pronounce it correctly, and Reyna gave him a murderous look, saying that was the name of a little girl from San Juan and she left it in Puerto Rico.

   When they were fifteen, they went to
   Charleston

They thought it was a Southern belle from the civil war, but every time they tried to approach it, it disappeared. Reyna decided to approach it on her own. When she came back, she seemed shaken up and didn't tell Jason what it said. After that, Reyna never acted the same around him after that.

     . Jason is a jack of all trades. Jason is a master swordsman and spearman. He is the only demigod that can consistently utilize 2 elements, lightning and air. Jason can fly, summon "a legion" of venti to increase his number (like a child of Hades), and can be very destructive when he controls the weather. All of this makes Jason one of the strongest demigods in the entire series.

     Jason's sister, Thalia Grace, was born to Zeus. Thalia is a Greek demigod, because when Zeus visited her mother the first time, he was in his Greek form. When Zeus came to Jason's mother for the second time, he came in his Roman form, Jupiter. Jason was, therefore, a Roman demigod, while his sister is Greek.

    It is shown that Jason cared for his sister. He felt somewhat depressed that Thalia found a new family in the

    . However, it is shown that when Jason first saw her picture, and Annabeth told him her last name, his instincts told him she is dangerous, as Juno left enough memory to know that digging up his past could be disastrous and that she was his sister. Thalia was deeply upset when she found out about Jason's death. Thalia screamed a lot in frustration and threw things around in rage

     Wilderness School
     . The next three weeks of dating were the best in Piper's life, but the memories were fake in reality. Jason woke up on a bus on the way to the
     Grand Canyon
     with no memories, and Piper squeezed his hand and asked if he was okay. Jason thought that Piper was cute and seriously beautiful, but he didn't know her (due to his memory loss). Piper eventually realized that Jason wasn't lying about not knowing her and believed he had amnesia. Piper tried to retake his hand, but Jason let it go, which caused her to worry. However, even though Jason didn't know Piper well, he was angry when
     Dylan
     , a bully, and the other girls harassed her. Eventually, Piper fell off the ledge of the Grand Canyon because of

Jason admits that he was tempted to kiss Piper at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. After the incident with the storm spirits, Annabeth approaches Jason and his group. After a conversation, they board a chariot and head to Camp Half-Blood. When they arrived at

Jason was grateful for Piper and needed a friend, and thought he was more beautiful after she lost the Aphrodite blessing. He thought she was beautiful and confident. Jason even began wishing their fake relationship was real the longer he spent with her, but thought it wasn't fair to Piper if he had someone waiting for him back home. Jason told Piper she was amazing after they left the palace, but Piper felt guilty, thinking if he knew the truth about her, he wouldn't like her anymore. She also became skeptical of Jason, worrying if he was the enemy.

After that, Jason encouraged Piper to get some sleep and she put her head in his lap and started snoring. Jason encouraged her to tell him and Leo about her father when he found out he was in trouble, but Piper didn't want to, afraid it would hurt them. Piper eventually told Jason and Leo, and to her surprise, Jason put his arm around her and apologized for what happened to her dad and said he trusted her with his life. After she saved him and he had to go home, his memories of the incident erased, Piper sobbed into Jason's shirt, and he hugged her, and he said she did amazing.

     After the quest was over, Piper threatened Drew that if she even talked to Jason, she would throw her over the Long Island sound and that Jason was hers. Piper could also sense that Jason saw his past, and she didn't push him to talk about it and told him she would follow him anywhere. The two held hands afterward. People watched Piper and Jason and were disappointed that they didn't kiss, but Piper knew that they would in time. As for Jason, he had feelings for Piper, but when he remembered

However, Piper was jealous of Reyna and felt guilty about being Jason's boyfriend after she met her for the first time, and was worried that Jason had feelings for her. The jealousy became worse when Jason encouraged Piper to tell Reyna the truth about what happened, and Hazel and Annabeth winced, wondering how he could be so clueless. She also wished he wouldn't act so distant sometimes, like when he was reluctant to tell her about the
     Mark of Athena

     Their relationship was more stable after that, though Piper was still jealous of Reyna, and when Jason talked about when he and Reyna went to
     Charleston

She also got jealous when he said he trusted her, but Jason said he was beautiful and powerful and didn't want her to be Roman, he wanted her to be herself, but she couldn't get rid of her doubts. Piper mostly admired how he was a leader and didn't break the rules and admired how easily he did each task. The two cooperated well when they defeated

Piper reassured him that they would figure it out, and even though he wasn't sure if he bought what she said, she was glad he was confiding in him. They kissed after. Later, when they went to save

Piper's jealousy of Reyna seemed to have subsided, though Jason was cautious when he mentioned her. Every time Jason thought of Reyna, he could only think of Piper and wondered if she was using Aphrodite magic on him. Jason was relieved when Piper suggested going to
     Dalmatia

She was also confused when he defended Nico, and she and Leo quizzically glanced at each other, wondering when he supported Nico. Piper noticed how Jason had changed in the last few months and had realized he was getting more comfortable with himself. Jason excitedly kissed Piper when she figured out the last line in the prophecy and said she was a genius. Jason was very grateful for Piper after she saved him from

Piper helped him heal over the following days and regularly changed his bandages. She also told him Cherokee stories to comfort him.

     since Reyna was twelve. Reyna and Jason became very good friends, and Reyna developed a huge crush on Jason and thought of him as an All-American boy, which Jason was oblivious to. Reyna and Jason bonded over
     Diocletian
     and liked to talk about him and wanted to see
     Dalmatia
     someday. When Reyna was 14, they went on a quest to Charleston to salvage Imperial gold weapons from the CSS Hunley, and Reyna saw

The two ended up being co-praetors for a few months, and during that time, Reyna believed they had a romantic future together. Then Jason went missing. Reyna was the last person Jason talked to before he went missing.

Percy realized that Reyna had strong feelings for Jason and considered him to be more than a colleague. Percy (who can be dense about romance) noticed Reyna's feelings for Jason on multiple occasions. When Reyna had a private conversation with Percy, she had spoken very highly of Jason. Percy heard about him so much, and he asked Reyna if she was dating Jason. Reyna said they might've been together, and she believed that a romantic relationship would form between her and Jason with more time. Reyna really liked Jason as a praetor and wanted a warrior like him to rule Camp with her. When the

Annabeth noticed that Reyna spoke the word colleague like it was dangerous, implying that Reyna viewed Jason to be more than a colleague. Jason introduced Reyna to Annabeth, Leo, and Piper. Reyna was very excited to have a proper reunion with Jason. When Reyna turned towards Jason, Annabeth noticed that Reyna had a "hungry sort of gleam" in her eyes. When the group decided to eat together, Reyna sat with Jason and his friends. However, Reyna realized that Jason and Piper were a couple and looked back and forth between them with her brow creased. Reyna was deeply saddened to see Jason's relationship with Piper, and her eyes became stormy, reflecting Reyna's pain. But Jason was oblivious to Reyna's jealousy and even asked her if he could show Piper around

Annabeth compared Reyna's pain to rubbing salt on an open wound. Eventually, Reyna let Jason give Piper a tour of New Rome. But Reyna had a hardened expression, and her tone towards Jason was cold. Later on, Reyna spoke with Annabeth privately and confided that Jason changed. In Reyna's eyes, Jason was not quite Roman anymore, and Reyna's voice sounded like broken glass. Annabeth, who had "spent her whole life learning to read people," sensed that Reyna wanted Jason to "love her." Also, Piper admired Reyna for keeping her emotions in control and not being too upset about Jason. Piper didn't blame Reyna for having a crush on Jason and understood her reasons. Reyna admires Jason for his personality. Reyna looked up to Jason because he always followed the rules, was a leader, and tried to be a role model for other campers. At his core, Jason is a Roman, which is one of the reasons why Reyna was attracted to him.

     After leaving Camp Jupiter, Jason wanted to contact Reyna and tell her what happened, thinking she would believe them. He even encouraged Piper to try, which made Annabeth and Hazel cringe at how oblivious he was to her feelings for him. Jason later confessed to Piper that he never had feelings for Reyna or felt that way towards her and wouldn't abandon Piper for Reyna at Camp Jupiter. However, Jason trusted Reyna and hoped that she would still be on his side. Jason believed that Reyna could slow the Romans down.

     and went across the Atlantic to find Jason at Dalmatia due to a promise they made to each other when they were young. Jason was amazed that Reyna would journey across the Atlantic Ocean alone, and didn't know if it was terrifying or awe-inspiring, and knew if anyone could make it across the Ocean, she could. Jason told his crewmates about Reyna and left a note for her in Split of their route to

It is also revealed that Jason said good things about Reyna to Thalia (his older sister). As for Reyna, she was upset because she did not see Jason in Dalmatia. Reyna daydreamed about visiting the palace in Split alongside Jason to admire their favorite emperor's home. Reyna pictured having romantic walks with Jason through the old city and having sunset picnics together on the parapets. When Reyna met with Thalia, she was distracted by her electric blue eyes because they reminded her of Jason. Reyna also felt insecure about being rejected and humiliated by Jason, which Orion used to taunt her. By the end of the book, Reyna stops having feelings for Jason and let go of her jealousy towards Piper. When the Argo II arrived, Reyna addressed Piper, not Jason.

Many people were also trying to tell Reyna what to do about her love life which added more pressure. Reyna did care for Jason romantically and believed they had a future together. But after Jason's death, Reyna realized that she didn't need someone else to be happy, which played a role in her decision to join the Hunters.

     Wilderness School
     . Leo remembered messing with Jason, pranking him, and in return, Jason wouldn't be annoyed by Leo's jokes. However, when Jason and Piper started dating in the fake memories, Leo felt like he was not needed anymore and even though he was happy for them, he felt like a third wheel. When the two actually met, Leo thought that Jason was messing with him and faking his amnesia to get back at the last time he pranked him. But Jason knew that he never met him before and that his memories were fake. Leo tried to mess with Jason, saying that he does everything he says, does his chores, and gives him dessert, but Piper chastised him. Jason thought that Leo was weird, and told him that. He thought that if Leo was his best friend, his life must be very messed up. Jason tried to question Leo to see if they were really friends, and when Leo couldn't prove the details of when they met, Jason knew that he was right. Nevertheless, Jason was concerned about Leo's safety when he was attacked by

     Quest for Hera
     with Jason, saying that he can get him a ride. Jason smiled and let him go, saying that since their journey started together, it was right for him to come with them, and that if he can get him a ride, he can go. Leo was overjoyed and pumped his fist. Leo knew that he could help Jason as soon as he heard his vision, and knew the woman he saw was the same woman who he saw as Tía Callida. Leo ended up fixing

     to transport Jason and Piper on the quest. Jason was weirded out but amazed when he found out that Leo fixed Festus, and thought it was weird that he named it Happy the dragon, but was ready to accompany him.
Leo and Jason bonded over the course of the quest when Leo saved Jason from
     Ma Gasket
     and the other cyclops, and trusted Jason enough to tell him about Tía Callida, still considering Jason his friend. Jason was very impressed with Leo when he saved him from the cyclops with one tool kit, thinking it wasn't bad. In return, Leo was also grateful for Jason when he was willing to fight Calais and Zethes to save him. In Chicago, Leo even confided in Jason, telling him about his fire powers and his mother's  death. Jason was very Impressed by his cooking and his fire powers, and when Leo said he didn't want to tell him because he didn't want to look like a freak, he reassured him that he was just as a freak as he and Piper were. He also reassured him what happened to his mom wasn't his fault.

Leo revealed that he thought Jason was always the star, who took everything for granted, and Jason said that Leo was annoying, who cannot take anything seriously or even fix a dragon. Piper managed to snap the two out of it and save them from killing each other. After the incident, Leo and Jason both felt horrible about how Medea turned them against each other, and Leo felt bad about how he did secretly resent Jason for the things he told him. Leo was upset about what Jason told him, even the next day, made worse by the fact that Festus broke for good. Jason tried to apologize, and said what happened wasn't Leo's fault and reassured him that he was amazing, but Leo brushed it off, still upset by his failure. Jason finally apologized in Omaha, saying he didn't mean anything he said and that he wished he could do half of the things Leo could do. He said that Leo did take things seriously and that he wasn't annoying. Leo accepted his apology, and joked that he can't resent him if he apologizes, and that he is supposed to. He told him that he is annoying and to not insult his ability to annoy. This eased the tension between the two.

For once, Leo didn't feel jealous of Jason and actually sympathized with him, knowing that he was lucky to know his mom while Jason didn't, finding himself saying "Love You" in Morse code on his knee. Later, when they went to Aeolus's palace, Leo went to comfort Jason while they walked, and Jason expressed his jealousy towards Thalia of having all the demigod stuff together. Jason even confided in him, saying he wondered if what happened with his mom was his fault. Leo supported him, saying that it takes awhile to get used to demigod stuff and that what happened with his mom wasn't his fault.

After they saved Camp, Jason sat with Leo and Piper at the campfire and they drank hot chocolate. Leo thanked Jason for saving him, and Jason reassured Leo that he would do anything for him.

But this didn't affect his friendship with Jason at all and didn't resent him for it. Leo was ecstatic after he returned from Salt Lake City to find Jason awake, and greeted him, saying he was glad he was better.

Annabeth later walked in on Jason looking at pictures to check on him, and encouraged him and said he would do fine on the quest. She also told Jason that he was most likely a loner who survived fighting monsters before he arrived at Camp, though she was unsure where he got the tattoos. Jason also confided to Annabeth about his dream and Annabeth gave him advice for the quest.

Once they got to Salona flew Nico into the sky, which made Nico angry about being touched. He thought having Nico around was not reassuring when they went underground, especially with the glow of his Stygian Iron sword. Jason comforted him when Nico was nervous about confronting Cupid, even though he thought it's just a crush on Annabeth, and said it may be embarrassing, but it's just for the scepter. When the two arrive in Salona, Jason is grateful to have Nico there with him, and the two defended each other during Cupid's attacks, with Nico helping Jason up when he fell. Nico even let himself be bullied by Cupid so he could leave Jason alone. Jason was so shocked by what he saw from Nico's past that he was unable to move or speak. But Jason realized by Nico was so afraid, and realized he had a crush on Percy. Nico eventually was forced to confess that he had a crush on Percy, and Jason accepted him immediately, thinking about his perspective of being gay in the 1940s, and told Nico that he wouldn't tell anyone if he didn’t want to. Nico almost cried and said he didn't like Percy anymore, saying he was young and impressionable. Jason said he had seen people do many brave things, but what he had done was the bravest.

At Auster's palace, Nico lashed out and yelled at Jason for not being able to convince Auster to leave sooner, and that he had suffered too many embarrassments. Jason encourages Nico to take a risk and also tells Nico to stop running away and stop hiding, which angers Nico, making Jason grab his sword believing a fight is about to start.

Nico, on the other hand, is still embarrassed about Salona and when Jason picked him up. Nevertheless, Nico's primary concern other than Hazel is for Jason. When Nico found out that anyone from the Seven may die, Nico felt he was back in the bronze jar. He was grateful for Jason and the Seven for saving him and Rome and welcoming him on the ship.

He felt guilty for squashing Jason's hopes, but he knew it wasn't fair to give him false They also talked about how maybe they don't need more prophecies for awhile, after they find out the Oracle was blocked. Jason tried to convince Nico to stay at Camp again, but when Jason finds out Nico is staying at Camp Half-Blood, Jason almost hugged him, but he realized he didn't like touching and apologized, but Nico said he was an exception. Jason then have him a bear hug so hard his ribs cracked. He talked about all the fun they will have, and said they can sit with each other, team up for sing along contests, and team up for Capture the Flag.

Jason was annoyed by this, asking if he was a kid to him, and he joked that he was definitely not a kid to him, saying he wasn't cute or had any redeeming social value. Coach Hedge was worried about Jason when he wanted to defeat the giants with out him, and told him, Piper, and Percy that he could come with them. After Jason rejected his offer, Coach Hedge told them to come back quickly or he would blast them with ballistae.
