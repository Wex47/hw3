   In early Egyptian mythology, Anubis may have different parentage. Rather than the son of Set, he may be the son of Osiris and Nephthys, the result of the goddess, possibly, tricking Osiris. Nephthys' betrayal played a role in Set's desire to kill Osiris. Later in mythology, however, it does describe him as Set's son.

   Anubis may have been one of the most important of Egyptian gods. When a corpse was mummified the priests could have worn jackal-headed masks and maybe prayed to Anubis. At the tomb, the priest could have held the mummy during the

While he allows Sadie to see him in his teenage boy form, he appears to have a jackal head to Carter. He at first refuses to help, and shows dislike towards Carter (mostly because Carter was hosting Horus at that time). He shows Sadie the Hall of Ma'at's New Orleans background, and lets it slip that Set is his father and that the Hall of Ma'at is weakening. Anubis eventually gives Sadie the feather of truth, but asks Sadie three questions before doing so: was she ready, would she give her life to save her brother, and would she save the world if it meant giving up their father.

After Walt returns to life and gives Sadie instructions to return to Carter to help him, he has Sadie look closer and she realizes what he and Anubis had been planning: after Walt died, Anubis took him as his host and is now keeping Walt alive.

The two essentially become one being, wearing a combination of Walt and Anubis' outfits and start a relationship with Sadie, allowing her to be with the two people she loves at the same time without Anubis' godhood or Walt's curse getting in the way.

   As a result of never having taken on a host before and never having lived a mortal life, Anubis doesn't know or understand much about human customs, though his relationship with Sadie helps him with that.

He even shows up at BAG's dance and dances with her, though after this he is banned from having contact with her, though he later explains that this is simply because he has no mortal form and is interacting with her as a god. Walt and Anubis had been planning for some time that when Walt died, Walt would host Anubis. After Walt dies for a few seconds, Sadie is not sure what she thinks about having both guys she likes in the same body. However, Sadie starts to like the idea when Anubis and Walt protect her in battle and both swear to always protect her. With the help of her mother, Sadie realizes that this gives her the chance to be with both boys she loves at once and starts a relationship with Walt/Anubis who have merged like Sadie and Carter were able to do with their gods to essentially become one being.

When Walt is near death, Anubis comes to him and Sadie to offer him the chance to carry out their plan, for Anubis to take Walt on as his first host which both god and human want as it allows them to be with Sadie which Anubis had been forbidden from doing as he has no mortal form and Walt can't do as he's dying. After Walt dies, Anubis takes him as his host and the two merge to become one being with traits of both Anubis and Walt. Walt is dependent on Anubis' presence to remain alive and using Walt as a host allows Anubis to remain on Earth even when the other gods leave. According to

   Despite his order for the gods to exile themselves from Earth for a long time, Ra allowed Anubis to remain on Earth in Walt's body. In doing so, he is the only god besides Osiris (who is hosted by Julius) that at least somewhat supports Anubis' relationship with Sadie. It's possible he did this out of compassion to Sadie and Walt as he owed Sadie and Walt would die without Anubis. Ra's allowing of this also allows Anubis to explore something he never has before along with his relationship with Sadie: a mortal life. Never having taken a host before, Anubis has never lived a mortal life unlike the other gods and Ra allowing him to stay gives him that chance which Ruby Kane says is a good thing as he's never gotten the chance to live any sort of a normal life.

    started channeling Anubis' powers through the

    , no one had ever done so before as Sadie thinks about how Walt followed the Path of Anubis and no one ever had before him. Apparently, this was unintentional as Walt was unaware at first of which god's powers he was channeling but he and Anubis eventually figured it out.

    Unlike the other hosts and their gods, Anubis is shown to maintain an equilibrium with Walt at all times. In the
    Battle of the Hall of Ages
    , when the other magicians and their gods lost their harmony, Anubis and Walt retained it due to their love for Sadie. Ruby Kane later tells Sadie that Anubis and Walt have basically become one person now, further highlighting this.

    After Anubis and Walt, the two boys she loves become one, Sadie is conflicted by it. Carter comments on the irony of it at one point: Sadie was torn between Anubis and Walt, one of whom she couldn't have because he was a god and off-limits and the other she couldn't have because he was dying but now they had become one guy who wasn't off-limits or dying and she wasn't happy with it.
