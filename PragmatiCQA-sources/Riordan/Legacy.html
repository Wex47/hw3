  <p key="2b870484-7ead-4939-aaec-94e1a9d63bda">
   Legacies are called as such due to being a mortal grandchild or further descendant of a particular deity, for example having three mortal grandparents and one godly grandparent. Legacies only count the god they are descendant of as an ancestor rather than that deity's parents or grandparents, for example, a legacy of Ares/Mars is not considered a legacy of Zeus/Jupiter. However, it is possible to be a legacy of two or more gods through various ancestral combinations.
  </p>
  <p key="e89b3938-8bc5-4a27-9687-803ca13e8fa0">
   Legacies are shown to sometimes have the abilities of their divine ancestor, such as Octavian having the gift of
   <a href="Prophecy Ability.html" key="55d3b6bb-2395-439f-8395-c94a1888d020" title="Prophecy (Ability)">

   </a>
   abilities. While this is true of some legacies, not every legacy has the abilities of their divine ancestor. This is due to divine powers diluting more and more after every generation of reproducing with mortals, however, if a legacy’s parents are powerful enough demigods, then the legacy’s abilities will likely be on par with their half-blood parents. Androgeos, the son of

   , and thus a legacy of Zeus and Helios respectively, was said to have tremendous athletic abilities.
  </p>
  <p key="39c79e91-ee1e-40e1-9cfd-932fdd7797f1">
   It is presumed that legacies still attract monster attention while in the mortal world, just to a lesser degree. The amount of monstrous attention they draw to themselves would depend on how powerful they are and/or how watered down their godly heritage is.
  </p>
  <p key="be741298-eec4-4fc0-9be3-7630104fe38e">
   In ancient times legacies were more common, with more demigods reaching adulthood and having children. While legacies are still fairly common among those with modern-day divine Roman lineage, they are a rarity among those with divine Greek lineage due to fewer reaching their twenties and beyond.
  </p>
  <p key="62fdffd9-9cfd-457f-9607-a71ebcdd3868">
   Legacies can sometimes suffer as a result of being the descendant of multiple deities or being both a demigod and a legacy. For example,

    Children born to a demigod and a god or a legacy and a god are considered to be both a demigod and a legacy, such as Frank Zhang (a son of Mars and legacy of Poseidon) and Claudia (a daughter of Cardea and legacy of Mercury).

    If a legacy has two divine ancestors or is both a demigod and a legacy, they are
    tattooed
    with both of their symbols. For example, Claudia has a hinge for being a daughter of
    Cardea
    and a caduceus for being a great-granddaughter of

    It appears that a legacy is only named for their closest godly ancestor. For instance,
    <a href="Octavian.html" key="fc4fa50a-4faa-4243-bb03-d5982094e1c6" title="Octavian">
     Octavian

    is a legacy of Apollo, however he is not referred to as a legacy of Jupiter or Saturn, Apollo's father and grandfather respectively.
