   While Magnus and the crew relax on board, Njord brags about his feet and how he won Skadi the ice giantess. They also talk about their upcoming quest. Njord explains that to get to the Ship of the Dead, they must pass Niflheim and Jotunheim, and have a very small chance of surviving even though they could seek help by Skadi along the way. He also explains that in order to win the flyting against Loki, Magnus must get Kvasir's Mead, the most valuable elixir protected by the giants. It was created from all of the Norse gods' spit, and out came Kvasir. But in order to kill the giants secretly guarding the mead, Blitz and Hearth are supposed to get Bolverk's whetstone. After much arguing, Magnus reluctantly lets Blitz and Hearth go on their duo quest.

   Meanwhile, T.J. starts loading his rifle, while talking and walking. Magnus is amazed at this, thinking it would've been like trying to tie his shoes and whistle "The Star-Spangled Banner" while jogging. T.J.'s first shot was to the giant's left eye. His second shot sparked off the giant's nose. Meanwhile, Pottery Barn slams their vase-fists into Mokkerkalfe's back, which, unfortunately, sank into Mokkerkalfe's gooey flesh. Mokkerkalfe tried to face P.B., but instead yanked them off their feet and dragged them around. Alex then steps in with her garrote and lassos P.B.'s legs and yanks them free. Pottery Barn went flying across the square and smashed through the window of a store. Mokkerkalfe then thinks that Alex is an enemy, and launches itself on top of Alex, drowning her in its wet clay.

Another memory; Teenager T.J. staring at a flyer encouraging military service. The image changed to a ship, where his friend complains how the Union put them on a ship, but T.J. was as eager as ever, holding his rifle.

   Magnus is back to the present, and the fighting continues. T.J. shoots Hrungnir's right eye, while Pottery Barn hung broken from a tree. T.J. then screams at Magnus to help Alex. Magnus heals Alex, even though she doesn't like being healed. Alex's memory: the time when Magnus had breakfast at hotel Valhalla, from Alex's point of view. Magnus was across Alex, looking "utterly dorky." Magnus wondered why this was on top of Alex's memories. Alex opened her eyes and swatted Magnus away. Pottery Barn, out of nowhere, jumps on top of Mokkerkalfe and pulls out his heart, and both warriors collapse. Meanwhile, T.J. cuts off Hrungnir's sinews. The einherji demands the location of Kvasir's mead, and is told that it was in Flåm, Norway, and that he must take the train. Hrungnir challenges T.J. to kill him, right in the heart. Just as T.J. does so, Jack warns the guys not to pierce Hrungnir's heart, for stone giants' hearts explode. Alex warns them all to hit the deck, and the giant explodes. T.J. groaned, as a piece of shrapnel embedded itself above his right eye. He assures them all that he can walk, and all three of them head back to the ship.

   The "masterpiece" doors in the waterfall wouldn't open. Magnus, Sam, Mallory and Jack can hear
   Gunlod
   , Suttung's daughter AKA the prisoner, inside. Odin stole most of Kvasir's Mead a long time ago but she still has a little left. Although she can give them the mead, she cannot leave as her life force is bounded to the cave. She advises them to pry the doors open with two magical weapons. Mallory uses her two knives allowing Gunlod to pour the mead into Sam's canteen with a hose. After that, she reveals that the group has triggered the silent alarm and that Baugi and Suttung will be here any minute.

   Sure enough, two eagles start flying towards the waterfall. Jack can only manage to take out one of the giants and they seemed to fast to outrun. So Sam decides to outfly
   Baugi
   while carrying Mallory in her walnut while Magnus takes on
   Suttung
   . A murder of crows nearby offers to help him but they don't have a plan. Suttung just came back from getting ready for Ragnarok, the border of Niflheim and Jotunheim isn't too far. Suttung is not happy that Magnus stole the mead. That's when Magnus accuses the giant of hypocrisy since he also stole the mead from Odin, but Suttung says his parents were killed by Fjalar and Gjalar, the dwarves. During their conversation, Magnus yells to get the crows to attack. But it takes a while for the birds to understand what he meant so Suttung attacks first. When they understand they start swarming the giant allowing Jack to deliver the finishing blow. The crows want something shiny as payment for what they did so Magnus directs them to the thralls' sharpened scythes. They tell him the last friendly place he'll find on the quest is the Fortress of Skadi.

   When Magnus gets back to the Big Banana, the crew has already taken care of Baugi. T.J. is not happy about the thralls being killed, Mack is officially a nickname of Mallory. The crew says Halfborn Gunderson did all the work in the battle against Baugi. The giant dropped a building near the ship and went to giant size, Halfborn just charged wanting to protect his old hometown of Flām. Even though Alex was the one who beheaded Baugi, everyone was so surprised at how much Halfborn went berserk.

   Night has fallen, the temperature drops. Halfborn admits to Magnus that he's glad to be out of his hometown again. He doesn't regret his life before he died even if he left his mother behind and never saw her again. He's just glad Mallory found out the truth and talking with Magnus made him feel better. He gave him the rudder and told him to look out for krakens. Sam comes up to him and offers a tiny taste of Kvasir's Mead but Magnus doesn't even think that's enough for his battle against Loki. Sam admits that the hardest thing is seeing someone for who they really are. Magnus knew he had to delay Ragnarok as long as possible so Sam, Amir, Percy, Annabeth, and Estelle can have a normal life.
