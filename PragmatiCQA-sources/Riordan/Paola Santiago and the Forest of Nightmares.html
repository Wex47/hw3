    Emma
    , and what's worse, her mom has an annoying new boyfriend. Even with her
    chupacabra
    puppy,
    Bruto
    , around, Pao can't escape the feeling that she’s all alone in the world. Pao has no one to tell that she's having nightmares again, this time in a terrifying forest. Even more troubling, at the central is her estranged father, an enigma of a man she barley remembers. And when Dante's
    abuela
    falls mysteriously ill, it seems that the dad Pao never knew is the key to healing the eccentric old woman. Pao's search for her father will send her far from home, where she will encounter new monsters and ghosts, a devastating betrayal, and finally, the forest of nightmares. Will the truths her father has been hiding save the people she loves, or destroy them? Once again Tehlor Kay Mejia draws on her Mexican heritage to the a wild and wondrous story that combines creatures from folklore with modern day challenges.

In a fit of rage, she trashes her mother’s room and finds notebooks. After tossing them around, she finds a note with her father's name and a PO Box in Pine Glad, Oregon. After waiting for Dante to be at soccer practice, she goes to speak with his grandmother. After Seniors Mata brings out random ingredients for a dish she wanted to teach Pao to make, the girl tells the old woman she broke up with Beto and is now dating someone named César. The old woman pauses at this and, gripping her face, says the two names are the same and that some will stop to nothing to stop her before passing out. Pao questions the old woman's legal status and wonders if calling 911 would get her deported. She calls Emma who agrees to call and pay for a private ambulance. Soon the green lights return, as well as Dante who can see them as well. The lights vanish as soon as Dante comes close to his grandmother and reveals she has been acting like that since they saved Emma and blames Pao for it. The ambulance arrives and Pao tells the paramedic everything that happened and goes with the Matas to the hospital. As they rush to the hospital, Pao decides to go to Pine Glad to find her father.

Soon Emma arrives and she tearfully tells her everything that has been happening since Emma was saved, including her plan to go to Oregon to find her father and cure Dante's grandmother. Emma is shocked by this and convinces Pao to only do this if their is no logical explanation. They enter the room, claiming to be Dante's cousins, where they say Seniors Mata is fine physically but they are not picking up any brainwaves. Emma talks to the doctors as Pao pulls a reluctant Dante into the hallway to talk. He knows she is hiding something but before she can tell him, they hear screams and her phone rings. She chooses to focus on the screams. They find two specters terrorized the people in the hallway. Pao takes out her knife as Dante goes to get his grandmother's

They find the camp abandoned and Pao starts to panic, with Dante's criticism only making her feel worse. After telling Pao this will be the first place the police would look, she snaps at him, saying she was going through things as he was pushing her away.

After learning Señora Mata is still the same as when they left and the doctors are bringing in a specialist and new equipment, she relays this information to Dante, who's expression is hard to read.

Pao feels disheartened upon learning Naomi came up with the plan to throw her the Arma del Alma, but gets angry after Naomi let's slip that she knew this things would happen. As Naomi defends herself by saying she thought Franco was exaggerating, Johnny comes up to them and says some tourists called the police on Pao "assaulting the vending machines" and they head out.

   In her dream, Pao is back in the forest and sees a
   Duendecillos

The creature tells her something is Spanish, which she has not gotten much better at since the summer, but deduces it wants her to follow it. Pao refuses and continues on the path, but the duendecillo pulls at the hem of her sweatshirt and Pao gives in. The creature leads her to a pond, saying something and pointing at the water. After a while, Pao realizes it wants her to get in the pond. Not being able to swim and fearing she might be on the verge of death, Pao is hesitant at first but gives in. The second Pao gets in the water, she feels better and notices that the bite is healing rapidly, not even leaving a scar. As soon as she is healed, Pao is sucked out of the bottom of the pond before finding herself falling down the the house they just arrived at. She picks herself up and finds a toddler who she realizes is a younger Dante. She realizes he can see her and pulls her towards the grapevines, saying a bad man is coming. Soon a large creature attacks the house, pulling a man out of the window and shaking him to death. Pao realizes he is Dante's father as a younger version of his mother calls for Dante to come to her before running away when she is nearly hit by debris. Pao tries to calm a crying Dante by saying they will be best friends in the future and he perks up when she mentions his abuela. Just then Señora Mata appears and takes Dante. She addresses Pao, again calling her Maria, and says to distract the monster as she takes her grandson to safety. Pao agrees and the old woman finally addresses her by her name, and tells her to find the ghost's family who died fifty years ago, as Pao readies herself to take on the monster.

She searches the house for any pictures that were taken fifty years ago and finds one of a woman and two girls in a silver locket. She then heads into the kitchen and the locket heats up, sticking to her hand. Pao resists crying out in pain as the ghost tries to grab her. She finds a bottle of Florida water and pours it on the locket, detaching it from her hand and returning it to its original gold color. The ghost then turns into a man and vanishes. Pao then plants the locket and gold flowers emerge from it. Soon a magnifying glass  sprout from the flowers and, when she takes it, it turns into a spear, her very own

She finds the magnifying glass in her pocket and searches the unkept house for anyone but finds no one. She finds Dante by the well, who knows she knows about his past and blames her for letting his father die. Pao says there was nothing she could do as Dante brings out his club. He says that despite his weapon, tragic backstory, and lineage, Pao is the hero and not him. He goes on to say that someone told him the truth and her lineage and why she has these dreams, as well as the danger she poses to his family. He explains that he was distancing himself from her to keep his grandmother safe and that he should be with her now and berates her for trying to keep him to herself. Pao apologies for it as he lands a blow on her shoulder. Surprised that he hit her, Pao transforms her Arma del Alma and pins Dante to the ground. Unfazed, he digs up the locket and breaks it, unleashing the ghost and escaping while Pao is distracted. Pao struggles to fight the ghost as she deals with Dante’s betrayal. She manages to stab the ghost in his shins and runs into the house, takes some pans to make noise to distract it. Pao is then grabbed by the ghost and it throws her against a wall. After willing her staff to her, Pao stabs the ghost and it shrinks before exploding. Pao then goes upstairs to find Naomi and Dante’s mother locked in his old room. Dante's mother says their is a key in a drawer by the stove and Pao goes to get it. After unlocking the door, Pao runs out to the vineyard and vomits before calling Emma.

Pal falls to her knees and is about to give up when Naomi gives her a pep talk. After Naomi realizes it is a force field, just like the camp, she asks Pao how she navigated it before. Pao says she used her flashlight and Naomi jokingly tells Pao the niños used echolocation, which Pao believes and she laughs at Pao for it. Just then a duenducillos arrives, the same one from Pao's dream. Pal tries asking her for help, learning her name is
