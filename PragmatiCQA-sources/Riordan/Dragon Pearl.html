   Min lives with her mother and four aunties. She has two more years to live at home before she can take the Space Forces exam. Legend has it, a

Min eavesdrops on the investigator's conversation with her mom. Through the sneezing sensation in her nose, she can tell her mom is using Charm on herself to look a bit more presentable. The investigator states that he has a message from him to Min. Min "arrives" to the meeting. In the message, Jun states that he made a lot of friends and is exploring new worlds like their dad, but still has lots of chores. Min wonders what Jun meant about his "friends" and their dad, as their dad died seven years before and was a skilled technician, not an explorer. Min denies knowing anything about the desertion. She refused to believe that Jun would desert from the Space Forces.

He grabs Min by the throat in an attempt to get more information. Seeing the man reach for something in his coat, Min turns into a dense block of metal and crushes the man's foot. Upon returning to her human form again she knocks the man out with a saucepan. The noise attracts Min's aunties. Min's mother forces her to clean up the mess she created while her mom and the aunties take the investigator to the next room.

Min decides to run away from home to find some answers. She packs faded clothes, her breathing masks, an outdated data-slate, takes some of the family's jades, (worth more than the currency on Jinju) and a picture of their family into a patched-up backpack. She told Manshik she was just taking clothes to the laundry room, but once she steps outside she doesn't look back.

Min tries but fails to convince Nari that she simply has business with one of the casino goers. Min is lead into the back room by Nari. Nari begins by stating that Min "has the look of Areum and her sisters." She also mentions Min's mother. Eventually, she introduces herself as the cousin that was disowned by the family. She reveals that she started the casino with Min's mother, and was given ownership after Min's mother quit. After doing some more explaining concerning Min's family history, Min states that she is looking for Captain Hye. Nari suggests that Min work for her instead of trying to flee the planet. Just to be able to contact Hye, Min agrees to try working for a day and seeing how it goes. Her job description is to wander around and serve wine. Min disguises herself in a fancier outfit and is introduced to a bouncer, Yong. She is given a tour of the casino, including the high-stakes tables, where at one of which Captain Hye was currently gambling at. She takes an order from another gambler and collects the order along with another unordered drink for Hye. She delivers her order and makes her way to the high-stakes room. She gives the unordered wine to Hye, using Charm to convince both Hye and the other gamblers that the captain had ordered the drink. She whispers to Hye that she wants to make a deal with her. She tries to arrange that a "colleague" of Nari's needs passage on Hye's ship and in exchange, Hye's debt to the casino would be forgiven. Hye agrees. However, upon returning to the bar, Min sees a drunk Hye being escorted to Nari's office and it is revealed that upon agreeing to the deal, Hye had bet everything she had. Min decides to leave and hope that the Red Azalea has other crew on board. She goes into the bathroom and drops her disguise. When she leaves the bathroom, she walks right into Yong. Yong recognizes her despite her previous disguise, and states, "Fox or no fox, you're too young for this life. I'll escort you out, while Nari is distracted." Yong pretends to make a show of throwing Min out of the casino, to whom Min flashes a grateful smile.

Concentrating on the control panel, Min felt like she is flying through deep space but goes too deep into the trance. She wakes up the medical bay and decides that this would be the opportunity to investigate Hwan's office while thinking about Jinju. Using litmus film she had acquired earlier, she undid the lock with no alarm, then she used it to see which buttons the captain pushed to figure out the code: 1-4-8-3. Inside, she smells Jun's scent coming from a sword. Searching through the notebooks reveals that Hwan is against the scholars locking the Dragon Pearl away and the Dragon Society using it to make the world even more wealthy. He wants to use the Pearl as a weapon to win wars and that he actually sent Jun on a secret mission with the others. Min quickly went back to Medical. Byung-Ho is lying next to her. He is still concerned about his passenger, the girl. Min charms Byung-Ho into knowing that the medical record was mistaken and that "the girl" survived. She has Byung-Ho forget about her.

   Kim Min introduced herself and Hwan knows that she is Jun's brother, she was taken to a solitary confinement cell where a force shield will knock her out. Hwan wakes her up after having nightmares, he has Min briefly transform into her true form of a red fox before they talk. Captain Hwan wants Min to use her Charm on the ghosts of the Fourth Colony so they can get the Dragon Pearl. Jun apparently proved to Hwan as less than cooperative, he stowed him away and won't release him unless Min finishes his task. Min got mad and her body got burned from the force shield after lunging failed, Hwan leaves her until she comes to her senses. Sujin appeared calling for Jang while they wore their invisibility cap, they tell Min to change into Lieutenant Hyosu. They typed the number pad to free her and has her follow them to an escape pod where Hanuel was waiting. They both disagree with what Hwan was doing, Sujin downloaded a map of the EMP mines.

   The escape pod landed into the trees of the Fourth Colony, the trio needed to move quickly as Hwan has many ways of tracking them. They had to be careful getting out as there were thorns and ghosts lurking nearby. After an hour walking in a windy direction, night was soon to fall, Jinju had more life than Min thought. The trio decide to stop for a brief break to make a dirt map, but almost immediately after that started to rain. Suddenly, a male ghost appears to warn Min about the danger that awaits her, it's Jun! A very miserable Min blames herself for his death thinking she could've prevented it if she hadn't spent so much time on the

   Sujin put on their invisibility cap and grabs a kit, Hanuel chanted to the spirits of wind and water. The two explain that they took a comm device with them because Hwan might be their only ticket out of there, Hyosu always told them to carry out a means of communication in case of emergencies. While Min was watching the two sleep, Jun appears again revealing that he convinced the crew to go after Hwan instead of her. He didn't want them to think he was abandoning them for real, this was to protect his sister and help her escape, before she tried herself. He appreciates that her sister came here, Jun can Charm the other ghosts and will go against Hwan for everything he's done, he also knows where the Pearl is!

   Soon after continuing their journey, heatless white (the color of the dead) fire and over ten thousand ghosts appear. They all introduce themselves before the unexpected arrival of Captain Hwan in a shuttle. Remembering that the Dragon Pearl lay beyond a cliff, Min turns into a hawk has Jun show her where the Pearl is, the Fourth Coloney's lower gravity helped her fly. She spotted the colorful pearl in the middle of another ghost throng and quickly snatches it. Min went back and changed into human form just as Hwan was standing above her, Hanuel and Sujin are surrounded by his soldier. One of the ghosts introduces herself as
   Eui
   , she and the other ghosts reveal that
   Hae
   , the greatest shaman, came there with the pearl to sing them all into the underworld. She only wanted control of the Dragon Society, but the influence of the ghosts caused her to drop the Dragon Pearl before flinging herself off the cliff. Min wants to help them but Hwan calls the fox a liar, he doesn't think she can control the pearl and is just using Sujin and Hanuel to find it. Jang wasn't given a funeral, while Min explains what happened he suddenly appears and confirms what she is saying. Min was feeling the power of the pearl, Hwan hinted that she can use Hwan to get them out here but Min promises the ghosts a tomb. Jang demands the captain that he let Min go, Hanuel notes that they've already had enough bad luck, Jun says this would bring honor to the Space Forces or his lost comrade, Myung. They swear on the bones of Jun, Myung and Jang causing the Pearl to glow making the weather clear and the land furnished. The Fourth Colony's entire landscape was changing, Jang has to leave but wants a proper military funeral. Once the Dragon Pearl was finished, Seo-Hyeon and the other ghosts, sans Jun, surround Hwan for leaving them. Hwan tried to fight back, including going into his true tiger form, but they herded him towards the woods. Jun still wants to visit all of the Thousand Worlds, he decided to haunt Min to make that possible. A lieutenant says that Min's fate will be decided on the

Min will wait in a guest cabin until they arrive at the Black Locust Station so she can go back home. There, she and Jun discuss how things will turn out as well as the chores that were and will be done. Hanuel and Sujin brought them dinner, with some extra food from Sujin, then played baduk in the closet where Hanuel crushed Min.

   At the Black Locust Station, a shaman was called who just said that ghosts can't be trusted. Kim Min arrived at a luxury hotel suite where she was visited by
   Security Officer Seok
   on the third morning, Seok was the same investigator that visited Min's house before she ran away. Min wanted the Dragon Society to offer terraforming services for Jinju, but Seok said that's unlikely to be agreeable. He suddenly grabbed the Dragon Pearl causing it to singe his head. Seok then mentioned her crime of impersonating Bae Jang among others, but was also remarkable in abilities and resourcefulness. So if Min has self-control, the Domestic Security Ministry could use her talents. With Jun as part of her good team, the ministry can protect her from the Dragon Society and the Space Forces.

   Upon reaching Jinju by civilian transport, Seok rented a hover-car. Kim Seonmi was waiting in front of the dome, she embraced her daughter and learned of both the Dragon Pearl and Jun. They went inside to tell the rest of the family the long story, once they were done Jun and Min could begin their personal visit to visit all the Thousand Worlds together.
