  <p key="4a70a709-7190-45df-86b1-fd1554667368">
   Hence, in ancient times, the priests of Dodona would take every imaginable care of the trees and channeled the trees' voices by hanging wind chimes in their branches. Given proper care, the trees could divine the future, and therefore served as an
   Oracle
   of sorts. (Interestingly, the Grove of Dodona was unique in that it had no connection with Apollo, the God of Prophecy, since the trees' powers emanated from Rhea instead.)

  <p key="8b74cb43-1d7a-4326-b670-6fcc95d78d2d">
   Without proper care, though, the voices of the trees would become unfocused and disharmonious, and the grove itself would eventually drive mortals to madness. It must still be noted, though, that Rhea had planted Dodona to serve as a benevolent force, and Apollo confirmed that it had indeed helped heroes in the past: for example, the masthead of the original Argo, which could speak to the
   Argonauts
   and give them guidance, was carved from a branch cultivated from one of the sacred trees in the grove by the priests of Dodona.
