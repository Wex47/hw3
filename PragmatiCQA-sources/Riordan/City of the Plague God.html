    Best-selling author Rick Riordan presents CITY OF THE PLAGUE GOD, an adventure based on ancient Mesopotamian mythology written by Sarwat Chadda, author of the Ash Mistry series. Characters from the Epic of Gilgamesh populate this high-stakes contemporary adventure in which all of Manhattan is threatened by the ancient god of plagues. Thirteen-year-old Sik wants a simple life going to school and helping at his parents’ deli in the evenings. But all that is blown to smithereens when Nergal comes looking for him, thinking that Sik holds the secret to eternal life. Turns out Sik is immortal but doesn’t know it, and that’s about to get him and the entire city into deep, deep trouble. Sik’s not in this alone. He’s got Belet, the adopted daughter of Ishtar, the goddess of love and war, on his side, and a former hero named Gilgamesh, who has taken up gardening in Central Park. Now all they have to do is retrieve the Flower of Immortality to save Manhattan from being wiped out by disease. To succeed, they’ll have to conquer sly demons, treacherous gods, and their own darkest nightmares.

Sik loses his breath for a second before realizing he doesn’t need to breathe. The brothers swim down and find a large hole leading to a grotto with a tree in it.

   As he flies, Sik comes face to face with Nergal, who has regained his lost beauty, and the god asks him why he is still trying to save what is lost and why Sik wants to save people who hate him. Sik, after seeing a large and heavy storm cloud, asks Nergal why he is still in the city. The god responds by saying he is just enjoying his handy work and notices the jar of perfume. After Sik refuses to hand it over, Nergal stabs the boy his shoulder and thigh as Sik races above the cloud and jumps in, opening the jar and watching the perfume mix with the rain as he falls. He passes out after he hits the asphalt and wakes up to Belet gently kicking him. It starts to rain as they come face to face with dozens of poxies who unaffected by the perfume. They watch as Nergal lands on a van and goes in for the kill, but the plague god starts to evaporate after the effects of the flower and perfume cancel themselves out as the poxies are cured. As his body falls apart, he pleads with Belet to spare him as she prepares to deliver the killing blow, but the plague god dies before she can.

   One month after Nergal's defeat, which has been referred to as the
   Big Rain
   , things return to mostly normal, however after being exposed twice to the desert copy Mo found, Sik now has the same immortality as Gilgamesh. As he and his father are painting the deli and his mother and Daoud are rearranging flowers, getting it ready for the reopening the next day, his father tells him about a dream he and his mother had about him and Mo in a boat in rough waters and their eldest son telling them to hang on for Sik. Soon his father trades places with Daoud just as someone settles across the street with a stand selling rainwater from the Big Rain. They watch him in annoyance as he crosses the street and express his hopes for an endorsement from Sik, who the con artist believes died, right in font of him. He walks away just as Daoud, who has been getting acting and modeling offers after receiving a scar from the fight with Idiptu, gets a call from his agent about playing the lead in an upcoming project. He goes inside just as Belet arrives with a box of flowers from Gilgamesh. She hands it to him, blushing slightly, and shows him a scar she revived recently to show that she is not immortal. She says she is going to
   Kurnugi
   to get Ishtar back and she tells Sik to stay when he offers to go with her. She agrees to come inside to pet Sargon, who is now living with the Aziz family, and to try a new sauce Sik made.
