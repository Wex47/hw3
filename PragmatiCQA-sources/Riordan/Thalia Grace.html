   After Thalia's birth, Zeus left the Grace household (as is custom for gods) and Beryl became unstable, thinking that she was the best mortal because she caught the attention of the lord of the sky and leader of the gods. When Thalia was seven, Zeus returned in his Roman aspect,

   Luke and Thalia had been following
   Amaltheia
   for three days already, all the way to
   Richmond
   ,
   Virginia
   . While hiding from Amaltheia, Thalia tells Luke of how Amaltheia had been the one to lead her to Luke, in a dragon's cave outside Charleston. Amaltheia indicated for them to enter a tall, 'creepy' mansion, as Luke describes it. Thalia asks Luke to use his powers to unlock the door, and together they enter the house. Immediately, the door locked behind them, and even Luke couldn't unlock it. Thalia attempts to force open a window, but is attacked by the enchanted drapes. The two of them run upstairs, following a disembodied voice, until they reach another room.
  </p>
  <p key="4114dcc9-2626-4661-87c3-c748872dda07">
   The door behind them locks again, and they are greeted by an elderly man who introduces himself as Halcyon Green, son of Apollo. In the room, a cell traps a monster, a leucrota, as they later learn. Halcyon Green quickly explains that the leucrota spoke for him, as Apollo punished him by taking his voice and trapping him in his mansion. Halcyon Green had used his powers of prophesying to save the life of a girl who was destined to die, something Apollo forbid him to do. From then on, he had to depend on helping the monsters lure demigods to their deaths to get food. The bars would rise at sundown, and the
   leucrotae
   would eat Luke and Thalia. Thalia then asks Hal to send the monsters away, so that they could talk in private. Halcyon tells them that most demigods had been lured there because of the treasure in a locked chest. Thalia realizes that Amaltheia wanted her to find the treasure. Luke manages to open the lock and they find a silver bracelet. Hal then tells them that Apollo said his curse was destined to be lifted when the owner of the treasure claimed it.
  </p>
  <p key="8bdd22e3-5f9b-4b92-96a8-e15ceabfc1f2">
   Thalia tries to activate the bracelet, thinking that it must have some special power, and meanwhile, Luke searches the internet for ideas on how to escape. Halcyon Green then decides to try and read the future once again for them. He sees that they would survive and that Thalia would sacrifice herself for her friends, but one day find her family. Here, Thalia automatically thinks of her brother, Jason, who she believes to be dead. Hal sees fire in Luke's future and a betrayal. Luke suddenly thinks to use Greek fire to escape, and the three search Hal's library for a recipe. Luke mixes a potion for Greek fire, and Thalia tries to summon a lightning bolt to finish it. Meanwhile,
   Halcyon Green
   gives Luke his diary and his knife and tells him to learn from his mistakes. Just then, the bars lift, and the leucrotae come out. Hal sacrifices himself to give Luke and Thalia enough time to run for it. He uses the bomb to set the mansion on fire, and while being attacked by the monsters, Luke figures out how to activate the bracelet, by using a code word, Aegis.

   Phoebe
   to stay with her and ordered the rest to track Lycaon. Thalia then asked the quartet if they were alright, saying they were tracking the wolves for awhile, and Piper immediately recognized Thalia and said she knew who she was. Thalia asked if she knew her, and Jason said he was her brother. Thalia was overjoyed to see him and gave him a big hug, sobbing, saying she recognized his scar, telling the others how he got it. A wolf approaches Thalia, and Thalia told Jason that she didn't have much time, but they must talk. After Piper collapsed, Thalia recognized that it was hypothermia and asked if Coach Hedge knew nature healing, and Thalia glared at Leo for having an incompetent satyr. Thalia then ordered Phoebe to take Hedge and Piper to be healed while she stayed with Jason.

   Jason, Leo, and Thalia didn't talk for a few minutes, with Thalia not happy with Leo sticking around. Thalia became even more annoyed with Leo if he asked her if her whole "not dating thing" was always or more of a seasonal thing, attracted to her. Thalia glared at Leo and looked at him like he was pond scum, making Leo like her even more. Jason apologized for Leo and explained his situation to Thalia. She cursed in Ancient Greek when Jason mentioned Midas. As they talked, Thalia ignored Leo's remark when he called her "Jason’s hot sister". After Thalia realized Jason didn't remember his past, Thalia explained to Jason what happened to their mother, and how he went missing. After Jason mentioned the Roman things he did, Thalia mentioned how Zeus spoke Latin the next time he came, and said Jason may be a Roman demigod. When Thalia learned there were others like Jason, she was shocked and said even though she had been all over the country, she never knew about that and said she must talk to

   The quartet was greeted by Thalia when they made it to the Wolf House. Thalia defeated an
   Earthborn
   as soon as they arrived and her arrow broke, much to her frustration. Leo complimented her on her shot, which Thalia ignored, as usual. Thalia hugged Jason and gave Piper a nod, and said that they didn't have much time, since the house is overrun by Venti, Wolves, and Earthborns. She said that a freak snowstorm came and the house became overrun by monsters. She and her Hunters tried to free Hera, but they couldn't figure out how to break the cage. When they arrived at the cage, Thalia mentioned that her heart wasn't in freeing her and that she wanted to leave her there. Hera threatened Thalia, and Thalia yelled at Hera for everything she had done to Annabeth, Jason, and her, and said she should just leave her to

   Thalia returned after Jason was fatally injured and sat by Piper, her hand on Jason's forehead. Thalia yelled at Hera and said it was her fault, telling her to do something about Jason. Hera told her to not address her that way and Thalia yelled at her to fix him. After Jason woke up, Thalia was relieved and asked Jason how he felt. After Jason said he saw something really terrible, Thalia joked that it was Hera, the loose cannon, and Hera finally snapped and threatened to turn Thalia into an aardvark. They both stopped arguing after Piper told them to stop. Piper told Thalia and Hera to stop arguing and that Thalia would've never found Jason if not for Hera. Thalia grunted and said that Piper had spirit, and gave her a Hunters business card, saying she could use her as a Hunter. After Hera explained things to them, Thalia said that she had to find Annabeth to explain things to her. Jason was hesitant about her leaving but Thalia said that she would never lose him again and that she will meet him back at

Later, when Thalia found out about what Lit did, Thalia was furious and on the brink of tears, and said that she fought too many battles and lost too many people at San Juan while fighting

   Thalia fought the next day with the Hunters, Jo, Emmie, and the guests at the Waystation against Commodus and is forces. Thalia was standing off against Commodus near the dining table with Jo, Calypso, and Lit, holding Emmie,

Thalia also kept her eyes shut while Apollo showed his true form, and had her clothes and hair lightened several shades, and Thalia asked why Apollo was roasted. Thalia tried to shoot Commodus, but missed. After Commodus was pushed out the window, Thalia gathered with the others to the window, and suggested doing a sweep of the neighborhood to look for enemy soldiers. Thalia also watched Georgina recite the next prophecy.

   Thalia and her Hunters left Indiana that night at moonrise, and Apollo saw them off. Thalia oversaw her Hunters while they gathered combat ostriches, saying that they will ride them, and then release them to live in peace. Thalia said that Jamie was helping them get ready, but he isn't hunter material, and asked if he wasn’t Greek or Roman. Apollo explained the different pantheons of gods existing to her, and Thalia didn’t get it, but Apollo said that the longer she lives, the weirder the world will get. Thalia then tells Apollo to check on Piper and Jason for her, and Apollo tells her to check on Artemis in return. Thalia then wished Apollo luck, and Apollo wished her happy fox hunting. Thalia said it wouldn’t be happy, but thanked him anyway, and rode down South Illinois street with ostriches.

   In some ways she's very similar to Artemis, as she enjoys being around her fellow Hunters and is a great fighter. She is also very loyal to those she trusts and respects, as she is willing to risk her life to protect them (for example, when she sacrificed herself on top of Half-Blood Hill). Unlike her fellow Hunters, Thalia apparently does not mind being around boys, as shown in

   Thalia also possesses a number of similarities with her father, Zeus. Aside from being a proficient warrior and extremely powerful, Thalia is also a great leader when she needs to be and is completely relentless against an opponent. However, Thalia has the unfortunate weakness of being supremely prideful, shown by her demanding that Percy not revealing her being afraid of heights. That said, Thalia is still

    Thalia
   </b>
   is a Greek name meaning “to flourish, to bloom”, which could be tied to the fact that Thalia was a tree and then bloomed out when the Golden Fleece healed her. Thalia is also the name of one of the Muses, Thalia, the Muse of Comedy, who is also a daughter of Zeus. Her last name is tied to her half-siblings, the
   Graces
   .
