    Zane Obispo's new life on a beautiful secluded tropical island, complete with his family and closest friends, should be perfect. But he can't control his newfound fire skills yet (inherited from his father, the Maya god Hurakan); there's a painful rift between him and his dog ever since she became a hell hound; and he doesn't know what to do with his feelings for Brooks. One day he discovers that by writing the book about his misadventures with the Maya gods, he unintentionally put other godborn children at risk. Unless Zane can find the godborns before the gods do, they will be killed. To make matters worse, Zane learns that Hurakan is scheduled to be executed. Zane knows he must rescue him, no matter the cost. Can he accomplish both tasks without the gods detecting him, or will he end up a permanent resident of the underworld? In this cleverly plotted sequel to The Storm Runner, the gang is back together again with spirited new characters, sneaky gods, Aztec royalty, unlikely alliances, and secrets darker than Zane could ever have imagined. Secrets that will change him forever.

   appeared and a terrified bird flew away, she had a coconut containing a message from Jazz. Brooks and Zane were forced to chase it and prevent Rosie from hunting. Unfortunately, the bird escaped through a tear in space, Zane fell into the sea with the coconut after Brooks hit an invisible wall.
   It seemed that the shadow magic was a barrier keeping them in as well as keeping the
   Mayan Gods
   from finding them. Brooks thinks Ixtab is trying to cover her own butt as the gods would likely be furious for her about telling them that Zane, a forbidden godborn, had died.

When Zane went back to his friends, Itzel gave them fashionable clothes to help survive in the human world. Brooks explained that people born as

   When he arrived, he found that the world was dying, he heard Hurakan's voice. He said dying doesn't mean the end for him, he appeared in his human form and Zane did the same because they had some familiarity, an emotional connection. Although he was hoping for Zane to show up, he didn't have a connection to the Jaguar Jade anymore, someone else called him! At the top of the pyramid, Zane found a note Hurakan wrote before Ah-Puch was defeated. It said he didn't want to be rescued, for it was a waste of time. When Hurakan reappeared, Zane told of the sobrenaturales' powers fading. He mentioned the Fire Keeper as the key, he tends the eternal flame, the source of tremendous power, sees what no one else can see, and can even manipulate the future. Zane got the idea of going to the Fire Keeper, before leaving Hurakan told Zane to run far away.

   When Zane came back to Brooks, she agreed with his plan to find this Fire Keeper. She got the idea of saving Hurakan herself while Zane went after the godborns. Returning to the underworld jungle, Zane made a flaming arrow change course towards him by accident. Ixtab reappeared and gave him a blue maize kernel to return to Xib'alb'a, she is

   After jumping through a waterfall, the group ended up in San Miguel de Allende,
   Mexico
   . Quinn said more time should have passed in the upper realm, but only a few hours passed since they entered Xib'alb'a. Zane entered a church with an altar and heard prayers, then they went to a building called
   El Grito
   where a death magician named
   Fausto
   lived. Inside were trees with masks on them, Fausto arrived and told Zane to put on a mask worn by a corpse to die, but it will be like anesthesia. Zane eyed a jade mask which Fausto revealed belonged to the
   Red Queen
   , a noble woman from 600 AD. A voice told Zane that it was an excellent choice, so he put it on.

   Zane Obispo found himself in a vaulted chamber, the deceased Red Queen appeared before him offering one minute and thirty seconds of questions. The fire near Zane whispered to him to tell him something, but the Red Queen was not good at voices. But fire keepers like her can in fact change the future, she is the great ancestor of the current Fire Keeper who is currently at Land's End, where two worlds meet. As the son of fire, Zane is connected in ways only the Fire Keeper can divulge to him, and a better future will come if they meet. Before leaving, the Red Queen briefly talked to a flame before telling Zane that he must meet the Fire Keeper alone lest great misfortune and curses will come.

   When Zane returned to El Grito, Fausto suggested that they stay there for the night. But at 4:03 a.m., Zane did some research and found the
   Arch of Cabo San Lucas
   where the
   Sea of Cortez
   and
   Pacific Ocean
   met. He snuck out of the building after writing a note, only to be caught by Quinn as a cat, she revealed that his father is going to be executed on March twenty-fourth! Apparently, the other gods changed their minds and are making this execution public sending invitations due to Pacific. Quinn told him to take care of Brooks and left, Rosie then appeared out of smoke and Ren was sleeping on a bench. Her shadows formed a man with a top hat, Rosie fought it while Zane went for a sneak attack, but it didn't work. Fortunately, Ren managed to wake up and make Top Hat disappear, she couldn't sleep in El Grito.

   Zane claimed he wanted to light a candle for a prayer, Ren wanted to come with him. She revealed that her dad's side comes from a bloodline of brujos. Ixtab told her that the Maya gods wanted them dead just like the godborns. Suddenly, a hunched and cloaked man appeared, he looked pale and sick. Zane was horrified, he felt it in his bones that this man was Ah-Puch! They all hid with their own invisibility gear, but Ah-Puch, who appeared to be searching for blood, was able to find him.

   Zane. He heard his conversation with Hurakan and was surprised at other godborns existing, Zane accidentally revealed his father's execution to him. It turns Ah-Puch was the one who called him to the Empty in Xib'alb'a as he got a connection when he was dragged in there, he was also spying on Zane. If he were to help the god, he'd take him to the Fire Keeper. Ren and Rosie agreed that Zane should do it, so he gave Ah-Puch tiny bits of the blue maize Ixtab gave them as soon as the god agreed to his terms.

   When the sun began to rise, Ah-Puch had some more and manged to open a gate to the Arch. They were at some docks at
   Cabo San Lucas
   , Zane saw a blue monkey in a tree but Ren did not. As soon as they got into a powerboat, they were ambushed by bat like creatures. They fought them off but Zane was growing weaker, Ah-Puch ate that whole corn seed, sucked up the supernatural bats' blood and regained his "handsome form." Ren suggested they toss them overboard as a burial, she said that they were same creatures that attacked her at Sievers Cove in
   Texas
   . When they returned to the docks, they grabbed a taxi and went to an amazing hotel which they were able to afford with K'ukumatz's credit. Ah-Puch told the godborns that a god named
   Camazotz
   used live in the House of Bats in Xib'alb'a until he was exiled. Those bats were likely his cronies attacking Ren because of her magic, but it wasn't the Maya. Ah-Puch refused to tell anything about Ren but told Zane that he must "surrender" to his fire powers. After he left, Zane called him mother and left a message. When he tried to listen to a fire pit, it created a binder containing an advertisement for El Arco, Zane told Rosie to stay behind, he thought she was his old Rosie again.

   When Zane went to the beach, the blue monkey reappeared a led him to a dinghy. When the two got past the breakers, the monkey transformed into a human and said he was the god,
   Itzamna
   . He was watching Zane for some time and he's a fan of his book, he didn't want a talent like him killed by the other gods. He offered Zane his services which were turned down, Itzamna will let him see the Fire Keeper if he simply continues to write his stories. He told him he'd likely die, but that makes a good story, Zane saw a dragon with a hand carrying a pencil in his mouth. That was a metaphor and Itzamna's faithful companion, he turned to dust and blew away.

   When Zane was back with Ren and Ah-Puch, he told them they had to go to New Mexico. Zane told them about the traitor thing, so Ren revealed that she is part Mexica from her dad, her family was the bruja bloodline of her kind but it didn't have anything to do with the mess. Ah-Puch mentioned that they couldn't have freed him, Camazotz is not that smart so he must be working for someone. Suddenly, some security guards came in to arrest them, they decided to charge away on Rosie until they were teleported to Zane's old home using their bound magic.

   The Gila Forest looked more like an illusion, then it changed into a stone wall with cells on it, Hondo and Brooks were imprisoned too and attacking Maya powers other than the twins would hurt the other prisoners. They have a plan to make a new empire and leave for Hurakan's execution, which is that day due to being in their world. Zane decided to surrender to the fire creating blue flames, he burned the back of the wall and but was still behind bars. On a nearby crane were Camazotz and his bats, but the other godborns didn't seem to be on the twins side nor were they in that forest. Just then, Ren, Rosie and Ah-Puch arrived, Ren used her Mexica shadow magic to create a key and unlock the cages. Ah-Puch revealed that everything was created by the twins, inherited from
   Ixkik'

Camazotz revealed that they weren't going to end the world, they were going to use them to awaken the Mexica monsters and gods, starting with Tlaltecuhtli using Hurakan! Once that goddess awakens, Zane's blood will used to power her and a ritual will begin for the others. Camazotz released some bats and Zane made Rosie go into hellhound mode, a fight between everyone broke out. The bat god got Brooks but Ah-Puch opened a gateway, before Camazotz could kill Ren Zane reluctantly gave the death god his Jaguar Jade. Ah-Puch reopened the gateway while staying behind to fight Camazotz.
