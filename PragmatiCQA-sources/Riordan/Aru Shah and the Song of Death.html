    Aru is only just getting the hang of this whole Pandava thing when the Otherworld goes into full panic mode. The god of love's bow and arrow have gone missing, and the thief isn't playing Cupid. Instead, they're turning people into heartless fighting-machine zombies. If that weren't bad enough, somehow Aru gets framed as the thief. If she doesn't find the arrow by the next full moon, she'll be kicked out of the Otherworld. For good. But, for better or worse, she won't be going it alone. Along with her soul-sister, Mini, Aru will team up with Brynne, an ultra-strong girl who knows more than she lets on, and Aiden, the boy who lives across the street and is also hiding plenty of secrets. Together they'll battle demons, travel through a glittering and dangerous serpent realm, and discover that their enemy isn't at all who they expected.

The thief's soul song didn't have any music, instead it had smoke and "fingernails" inside. On the back of the card Kamadeva gave them, Durvasa is at the

Up the staircase were booths for the sages Durvasa, Bhrigu, Kindama, and Narada. The last sage cursed a gandharva to lose sense of time for listening to music when he was talking. Durvasa called for the Pandavas while giving specific curses to people, yet he

   The three enter the Dreaming
   Grove of Ratri
   , home to the goddess of night. As soon as Brynne picked a silver fruit from one of the trees, three black hounds chased each of them. When Aru looked into one's eyes she saw the Sleeper, her sisters turning on her, and Boo imprisoned. They couldn't get to the bridge because they were trapped in a nightmare. Brynne was seeing Anila, her mother, disappointed in her, Aiden saw his mother crying about her relationship with his dad. Aru saw a Great Pyrenees in the reflection of the fruit, when she stood up to the nightmare hounds it got sad and turned into the white dog, then it woke up Aiden and Brynne making the other two hounds dissolve. Suddenly,
   Ratri
   appeared and revealed that the "apple" is a Dream Fruit, it shows what normally can't be seen like in dreams, she was responsible for Mini in their dreams. They can cross the bridge now, but are warned of Ratri's sister.

   At the Bridge of Dusk and Dawn, the three found Mini sleeping in the air. Nearby was the Palace of Day,
   Ushas
   , the arrogant goddess of the Dawn who drags the sun, lived there. She and her red cows appeared, but Mini wouldn't wake up. The other three said that they are in a disgusting bathroom with sneezing and the five-second rule, that worked. Brynne flew ahead as Aru turned Varja into a hoverboad to carry the others. But Aiden dropped Mini forcing Aru to pick her up, Aiden was sent towards the cows but just ended up riding one. Ushas was a huge fan of Malini, Aiden was arrogant too.

   When they were back at Durvasa, Mini took a POWER NAP she got from the warehouse. The earned more of the sage's trust by suggesting curses her was giving to people.

Brynne muscled the others to a portal leading to the kiosk for the Morris Country, then she revealed to the yaksha that they are the Pandavas causing him to sound the alarm allowing the quartet to get through the portal.

  <p key="322ef3df-487c-40fb-921e-509d9f47c960">
   When they arrived at the swamp, Brynne found the entrance to Ocean of Milk past some trees. But then five figures arrived, one was an asura who brought another taller figure nicknamed Sparky. Lady M, Surpanakha, told them to prevent any entry. A girl named

   was forced show the quartet that Surpanakha was beautiful by transforming. Aiden recognized one as
   Navdeep

   He decided to challenge Brynne to an eating contest so they can enter the Ocean of Milk. The food included lentil soup, naan, chutney, idli, and more. The contest begins, Sparky and Brynne talked about occasions where they ate lots of food. For dessert, there was rasmalai and halwa, Aru noticed Sparky changing when he ate while talking about is life. Brynne lost the contest as she was already full, but it turns out she lost to
   Agni
   , the god of fire. Flames began to inadvertently engulf the area around them, the Pandavas unsuccessfully asked their spiritual fathers for help, so Aru threw the BRIGHT IDEA bottle at Agni to push her idea of nothing edible onto him. Suddenly, the previously burned area turned rich with jewels. Agni gave them their weapons back and allowed passage into the Ocean of Milk. When questioned about the Khandava Forest, he told them the tale of
   Jaya and Vijaya
   , it proved that while life isn't fair, things don't happen without an unknown reason. Aru remembered something her mother told her, villains can do heroic things and heroes can do villainous things. Agni decided to bestow the quartet with gifts, Mini received a Night Flame so she would never be lost in the dark, Brynne's wind mace received a new flaming ability, Aru received an

Mini used her shield so they'd sneak to the doors, but one guard made the Pandava girls trip when he practiced dancing to bhangra. When the two nagas detained Aru, Surpanakha arrived and sent the guards to the outside, but she turned out to be Hira the rakshasi. She revealed that she is part of the Otherworld Foster Care System and Navdeep's family took her in, apparently he just acts arrogant when he's with his friends. Brynne offered to take her in, her uncle was a descendant of Mayasura, the architect who built the

   Lady M carrying the bow and arrow arrived. She said that her real name is not Surpanakha, the naga king didn't trust Uloopi after she fell in love with Arjuna. Lady M tried to persuade them in joining their cause by saying that stories die after they are stopped being told unless people find parts, polish them up, and breath life into them. That's what she wants the

   Meenakshi
   when she was born, the reason she wanted to marry Rama or Laxmana was because Ravana killed her greedy rakshasa husband. But Laxmana ridiculed her and her furious pride made her attack Sita. She's more than a monster in a story, she's a scapegoat who suffered disfigurement, she wanted to be remembered for her triumphs. However, now she was beginning to look more demonic as people imagined her, but she needs the

If they don't, they'll be banished and the Heartless will stay like that forever, two wrongs don't make a right. Aru got the idea of using Hira as an impostor Meenakshi, but she doesn't tell her until later when she had an opening. When Lady M returned, Aru wanted Kamadeva's bow and arrow, their weapons came back. But Meenakshi fired the arrow at Aiden, who was now Heartless.

   Upon the signal Mini threw Dee Dee over Lady M covering her with the shield. In the fight, Takshaka took control of the arrow but couldn't find Lady M, soon disguised Hira arrived and took the arrow. The real Lady M escaped Dee Dee, but when Aru got the arrow she reluctantly plunged it into her chest. Her soul did indeed become a song of death, it sounded like ice creeping across a window pane, a warning shout unleashed a second too late, water closing over your head, and the silent chime of a moment that has been forgotten forever. However, all the Heartless zombies, including Aiden, came back to normal. The sound of the
   celestial mounts
   were heard to take the Heartless to their homes, but Takshaka revealed that the quartet have missed their deadline before leaving through a portal. Lady M looked beautiful again, alas she then
