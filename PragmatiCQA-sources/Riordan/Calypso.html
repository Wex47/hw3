Every thousand years or so, the gods of Olympus will send Calypso a "companion" (hero) to Ogygia so that Calypso will "tend to him and befriend him." All the heroes sent to her attract her, so she falls in love with them, but they will never stay and will end up breaking her heart.

   . She is also cursed to have heroes wash up on her island, wounded or hurt for her to heal. However, the people that landed on her island were always people she would fall in love with, but they would never be able to stay with her.
Calypso reluctantly offers Percy the chance to stay with her on Ogygia, where he would be immortal. Though Percy hated to refuse, he did because his friends needed his help and he had many duties elsewhere. Accepting his choice, Calypso makes him a
   magical raft
   and sends him off, asking him to take one of her magical plants,
