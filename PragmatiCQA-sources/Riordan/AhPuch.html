   Many years ago, Ah-Puch ruled over the ninth lowest level of

   He waged a war against the other Mayan gods, including

He wore this weird helmet that had eyes hanging off it, the eyes of the people he'd recently killed. Around his fat neck was a red cape made of human skin, and stitched to the hood was an owl's head that resemble Muwan.

He had slitted eyes that blazed red and yellow fangs that glistened in the moonlight. His underbelly was red and maggoty scales.

He wore a white t-shirt and baggy gray pants. He gains a semi healthier appearance when Zane give him some Maize and eventually regains his regular appearance. However within twelve hours he gains a form resembling a middle aged man with a receding hairline. After Zane gives him his
