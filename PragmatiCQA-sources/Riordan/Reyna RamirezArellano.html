   Even though Reyna and

   were the first children of

    Bellona
   </a>
   in their family, millennia ago, Bellona declared that that her family would play pivotal roles in many battles. Some of her ancestors were heroes and some were villains. Her ancestors originated from Spain when it was a Roman province, and one of her ancestors was a conquistador who came to Puerto Rico with Poncé de Leon. One was Pirate Cofresí, a pirate who had gunshot wounds in his chest. Reyna's family villa was built with money from treasure he buried. Reyna's great great uncle was the first Latino submarine commander from World War Two.
  </p>
  <p key="aa51e42c-0055-416f-9954-42f05f8b711c">
   Eventually, Bellona fell in love with her father,
   Julian Ramírez-Arellano
   , a soldier in Iraq. He was a good soldier, charming and very gentle before Reyna was born. Bellona blessed Julian, but it wasn't enough for him. He wanted her to be his wife. Julian dedicated himself completely to Bellona and managed to win her heart. Her sister, Hylla, was born before he went back to Iraq for his last tour of duty. He was honorably discharged and came home a hero.
  </p>
  <p key="0bae10dc-3caa-4b7d-b4d7-32696d1ae39d">
   Soon after he came home, Bellona visited him one last time and gave him a glimpse of the future. She explained why his family was so important to her and that Rome would never fall as long as his bloodline remained. She meant to be reassuring but Julian fixated on those words and it began his downward spiral. Reyna was conceived during that visit.

    Childhood in Puerto Rico

  </h3>
  <p key="a7edca3a-2e69-41bf-9d1f-3f07755bb587">
   Reyna loved her home in Puerto Rico, even though she began to fear it as she got older. She loved the sound of Coquí frogs in her neighborhood and the smell of the ocean and magnolia and citrus trees. She and Hylla would walk down the Calle San Jose, counting cats and making stories for each one. She would also love to go to Plaza de Armas and watch old men play dominos. Reyna and Hylla lived in a huge estate with big white steps devoid of decoration. Their furniture was made of oak, steel, and leather. In her main room, there were terraces, which made her feel like she was being watched. Her father did everything he could to make their hacienda look like a modern home, adding skylights and painting everything white to make it bigger and brighter, but it still felt old. Her neighborhood had cats on the street, banana trees, crumbling pastel houses, and cobblestone.
  </p>
  <p key="5633132d-880a-4c7b-bc12-fd1617a36434">
   Her father changed during Reyna's childhood, and had PTSD. He couldn't stop thinking about the war and he had constant chronic pain from a roadside bomb that let shrapnel in his shoulder. He be became paranoid and thought Bellona's words meant that their bloodline would die and that Rome would fall. He saw enemies everywhere and began collecting weapons, turning their house into a fortress. He was unable to adjust to civilian life.
  </p>
  <p key="18d4ba78-73c1-4dd7-8f33-60d6c57c8e51">
   Reyna and Hylla would sometimes be able to escape from their father. They would hide in the fireplace and imagine that they could travel to places from there. On Sunday afternoons, they could escape to Barrachina's kitchen, where the staff would take pity on them and let them eat in the kitchen. However, Julian would lock Reyna and Hylla in their room at night, and if they snuck out, he would yell and throw furniture at them. He even became convinced that Reyna and Hylla were the enemies, spying and trying to undermine him. Ghosts began appearing and whispering to Julian, confirming his suspicions. They would watch Reyna from the terraces in her living room. Eventually, Julian became a
   Mania
   , with only his worst qualities remaining. Hylla would try her best to protect Reyna.
  </p>
  <p key="80d518ac-723b-452a-8e26-f33a00fcba79">
   One day, after they snuck out, when Reyna was ten, Julian was so angry he was glowing. He couldn't touch things anymore and learned how to move things like a poltergeist. He tore up the floor tiles and ripped open the sofa. He then threw a chair at Hylla, knocking her out. Reyna lost it and thought she was dead. Reyna grabbed Pirate Cofresí's saber and used it to vaporize her father. After she killed him, ghosts appeared at Reyna and taunted her, telling her she can never flee her crime, calling her a murderer and a traitor. When Hylla woke up, Reyna and Hylla finally escaped.

   while there, when a man washed up on the island talking about the Mark of Athena. The man muttered about how he ended up in Rome and saw the giants bane before they turned him into a guinea pig. Reyna spent enough time on Circe's island to know and recognize

Reyna felt like Venus thought she was broken and needed romantic healing, but she knew she wasn't broken. When she came back, she was shaken, and never acted the same about Jason. When she came back to Camp Jupiter, everyone knew what Venus had said except for Jason, and they gossiped about her, giving her pitiful looks and giving her advice on who she should date.

He tells her what Venus told him and suggests they start dating, she laughs and rejects him. When they reach the base she and her dogs inspect the station and find it abandoned.

Reyna is also a very brave and courageous character, as stated by many characters and shown through her noble and heroic feats and even gaining the blessings of two war goddesses, something no other character has ever accomplished. She's also intelligent, inventive, and quick-witted as shown by her knowledge of mythology, expertise with leading a city, and when she taped silver coins to her sword when confronted by
   Lycaon
   and his wolf pack. She was also able to cross the Mediterranean Sea in only three days with nothing but the armor on her back and her Pegasus while the Seven took weeks to do so with the Argo II.

     Diocletian

     someday. When Reyna was 14, they went on a quest to Charleston to salvage Imperial gold weapons from the CSS Hunley, and Reyna saw

The two ended up being co-praetors for a few months, and during that time, Reyna believed they had a romantic future together. Before Jason went missing, Reyna was the last person Jason talked to privately.

     , Reyna missed Jason a lot. After Jason's 8 month disappearance, Hazel said the Romans were searching for him and have not given up. Reyna grimaced at Hazel's statement. Percy realized that Reyna had strong feelings for Jason and considered him to be more than a colleague. Percy (who can be dense about romance) noticed Reyna's feelings for Jason on multiple occasions. When Reyna had a private conversation with Percy, she had spoken very highly of Jason. Percy heard about him so much, and he asked Reyna if she was dating Jason. Reyna said they might've been together, and she believed that a romantic relationship would form between her and Jason with more time. Reyna really liked Jason as a praetor and wanted a warrior like him to rule Camp with her. When the

Annabeth noticed that Reyna spoke the word colleague like it was dangerous, implying that Reyna viewed Jason to be more than a colleague. Jason introduced Reyna to Annabeth, Leo, and Piper. Reyna was very excited to have a proper reunion with Jason. When Reyna turned towards Jason, Annabeth noticed that Reyna had a "hungry sort of gleam" in her eyes. When the group decided to eat together, Reyna sat with Jason and his friends. However, Reyna realized that Jason and Piper were a couple and looked back and forth between them with her brow creased. Reyna was deeply saddened to see Jason's relationship with Piper, and her eyes became stormy, reflecting Reyna's pain. But Jason was oblivious to Reyna's jealousy and even asked her if he could show Piper around

Annabeth compared Reyna's pain to rubbing salt on an open wound. Eventually, Reyna let Jason give Piper a tour of New Rome. But Reyna had a hardened expression, and her tone towards Jason was cold. Later on, Reyna spoke with Annabeth privately and confided that Jason changed. In Reyna's eyes, Jason was not quite Roman anymore, and Reyna's voice sounded like broken glass. Annabeth, who had "spent her whole life learning to read people," sensed that Reyna wanted Jason to "love her." Also, Piper admired Reyna for keeping her emotions in control and not being too upset about Jason. Piper didn't blame Reyna for having a crush on Jason and understood her reasons. Reyna admires Jason for his personality. Reyna looked up to Jason because he always followed the rules, was a leader, and tried to be a role model for other campers. At his core, Jason is a Roman, which is one of the reasons why Reyna was attracted to him.

He even encouraged Piper to try, which made Annabeth and Hazel cringe at how oblivious he was to her feelings for him. Jason later confessed to Piper that he never had feelings for Reyna or felt that way towards her and wouldn't abandon Piper for Reyna at Camp Jupiter. However, Jason trusted Reyna and hoped that she would still be on his side. Jason believed that Reyna could slow the Romans down.

     and went across the Atlantic to find Jason at Dalmatia due to a promise they made to each other when they were young. Jason was amazed that Reyna would journey across the Atlantic Ocean alone, and didn't know if it was terrifying or awe-inspiring, and knew if anyone could make it across the Ocean, she could. Jason told his crewmates about Reyna and left a note for her in Split of their route to

It is also revealed that Jason said good things about Reyna to Thalia (his older sister). As for Reyna, she was upset because she did not see Jason in Dalmatia. Reyna daydreamed about visiting the palace in Split alongside Jason to admire their favorite emperor's home. Reyna pictured having romantic walks with Jason through the old city and having sunset picnics together on the parapets. When Reyna met with Thalia, she was distracted by her electric blue eyes because they reminded her of Jason. Reyna also felt insecure about being rejected and humiliated by Jason, which Orion used to taunt her. By the end of the book, Reyna stops having feelings for Jason and let go of her jealousy towards Piper. When the Argo II arrived, Reyna addressed Piper, not Jason.

Many people were also trying to tell Reyna what to do about her love life which added more pressure. Reyna did care for Jason romantically and believed they had a future together. But after Jason's death, Reyna realized that she didn't need someone else to be happy, which played a role in her decision to join the Hunters.

Since Percy came from outside the camp, Hazel asked if he met their missing praetor Jason Grace. Hazel said the Romans were searching for Jason and have not given up after his disappearance. Reyna grimaced at Hazel's statement, which made Percy realize that Reyna considered Jason to be more than a colleague, and she had strong feelings for him. Reyna wished him luck in the auguries and suggested that they compare notes on his past.

Percy also sympathized for Reyna and could tell how much Octavian bugged her and tried to ruin things for her. After the senate meeting, Reyna wanted to talk to Percy in private. Reyna vented about how much she hated Octavian, Percy understood and Reyna said he was smarter than he looked. Reyna then asked Percy if he remembered her or Hylla, and when Percy said he didn't, and Reyna explained how he and Annabeth destroyed their home when she was young. Percy said he didn't remember and Reyna decided that he was sincere. Reyna believed the gods sent Percy to make up for the loss of Jason and save her home. Reyna spoke very highly of Jason, which made Percy ask if they were a couple. Reyna said they might've been and that if she were given more time with Jason, a romantic relationship would have formed. Reyna said she wants to work with a Praetor that is an honest warrior like Jason. Since Percy reminded Reyna of Jason, she offered him the praetorship. Reyna admitted that a son of Neptune wouldn't be her first choice, but she prefers Percy over Octavian (a schemer), Hazel, and Frank. Reyna tells Percy that she wants to work with him to save her camp. Reyna says that together, they can save the legion, close the doors of death, and defeat Gaea. Reyna tells Percy during this time; she would be a helpful friend. Percy realized she was asking him out and said that he had a girlfriend, and didn't want power, and Reyna inquired that it wasn't very Roman of him. Reyna confided in Percy about how

After their conversation ended, Percy noticed that Reyna was extremely desperate to save Camp Jupiter. Reyna knew that she couldn't do this alone and grasped at anything that could help the legion. Percy understood why Reyna would ask him for help after seeing visions of Polybote's army. Percy apologized again before he left, and Reyna said that apologies weren't very Roman, and that she hoped he would consider her offer.

At the Feast of Fortuna, Reyna honored Percy and said that their destinies were made possible by Percy's deeds, then made him praetor, saying he earned his praetor's cloak. Reyna trusted Percy enough to believe him when he told her that he was a Greek demigod, Jason was coming back, and that the Greek gods were still around, and told the legion to trust him. When Percy told Reyna that Jason was returning, Reyna hoped that was true and said she missed Jason.

   . Piper practiced lines to say to Reyna when she met her, but ended up not having to say them since Reyna welcomed her and her friends, and since Jason introduced Piper to Reyna. However, Reyna quickly grew jealous of Piper as she looked between Piper and Jason with her brow creased, realizing they were a couple, and her eyes became stormy. Reyna became even more jealous when Jason asked to walk around

   with Piper, like rubbing salt in a wound, though she let them. While talking to Annabeth, Reyna revealed that she didn't trust what Piper said due to the sorcery in her voice. Reyna then thought that Piper and her friends betrayed her for firing on Camp Jupiter, making matters worse.

   As for Piper, she was prepared to hate Reyna, but admired the way she kept her feelings in check, staying polite and in control after realizing she was dating Jason. Piper didn't blame Reyna for having a crush on Jason, and knew why she would. She respected her for giving the Greeks a fair chance and putting the needs of her Camp ahead of her emotions, and thought she wasn't so bad. Reyna even made Piper feel guilty about dating Jason, which was silly to Piper since Reyna never dated Jason. But Piper never wanted to befriend her and the Romans in the first place, since she was afraid Jason would leave her for Reyna and Camp Jupiter. Seeing Reyna made Piper's worries about Jason leaving her worse. Piper's jealousy became even worse after Jason suggested that Piper contact her to convince her that they were innocent, oblivious to her jealousy, making Piper feel like all the blood in her body was draining to her feet. Piper said she could try, but she knew Reyna wouldn't be able to stop Octavian. Piper lamented to Jason how Reyna was powerful, beautiful, and Roman, and was jealous of how he trusted her, but Jason reassured her she didn't want her to be Reyna, she wanted her to be herself.

   if Reyna was okay, which shocked Jason, but he was happy about it. After Piper arrived at Camp, Reyna seemed to have been over her jealousy also and said it was about time she came, and Piper grinned, saying she had some giants to kill. Reyna returned the smile and told her to help herself to some barbarians, and Piper thanked her, making them jump into battle side by side. After that incident, Piper and Reyna, along with Annabeth, became inseparable as they helped the two Camps get along, wandering around Camp to check on the repairs, and Reyna valued Piper as a go-between between conflicts. At the campfire one night, Piper teased Reyna and asked if she was sure if her mother was a war goddess, and Reyna said she still intended to fight battles, but now they fight together.

   The day Reyna left, Reyna and Piper had one last conversation at the dock. Piper thought that Reyna was the only demigod who hadn't changed much during their journey, and knew she had been through a lot of pain. She wondered how she could bear it all and wondered if she had anything to confide in. Piper also thought she had a regal and beautiful face. Piper told Reyna that she did so much for both camps and wished she got more credit, and that without her, nothing they did would have been possible. Reyna laughed and thanked Piper, but said she didn't want attention, and that she knew what that was like. Piper, being the daughter of a movie star, understood that she didn't want to attract attention. Piper also told her she could sense that she could lend strength to others. Reyna was skeptical and wondered if Nico told her, but Piper said it was because she can sense it and see how much it drains her. After Piper asked her how she gets her strength back, Reyna joked that when she does, she will let her know, but Piper could sense sadness behind the words. Piper offered that if she needed time to take a break or get away, she can come to Camp Half-Blood and it would be good for her to take time for herself. Piper also joked that they would have to ban her from capture the flag because she could beat the entire camp solo. Reyna thanked Piper and said she would consider the offer.

   told her, since she was her daughter. Reyna told her what Venus told her in Charleston, and her words broke as she said how much she struggled with that. Piper became mad at her mother since she keeps ruining lives. Piper then tells her that she didn't know what she meant, but she knows that Reyna is an incredible person and that there is someone out there for her, and maybe it’s not a demigod or it is a mortal. Piper said that until then she has friends, and that even though she gives strength from others, she needs to draw from it once and awhile, and she is here for her. Reyna said that she had a way with words, and Piper promised she wasn't charmspeaking. Reyna said no charmspeaking was required and held out her hand to shake it. They shook hands and Reyna said she has a feeling she would see her again, and a Piper knew, because she was her friend and family now. That night, Piper thought the camp was empty without her and the Romans.

Frank also reassures Reyna that he will be able to handle things at camp himself to prepare for the battle, and though Reyna is hesitant on leaving her colleague alone, even though she knew he could do it, he said he could do it alone, relieving Reyna on her burdens of leadership. Before she left, Frank gave her a bear hug and told her to be careful, and Reyna was unsure what do about his show of affection, and her arms went stiff before she awkwardly patted him on the back, and wished him good luck too. Reyna was worried about Frank, reminding her of things he needed to do before he left, but she stopped herself and apologized, making Frank grin.

Reyna even tells Percy that she thinks Hazel would not be a good leader, due to her being a daughter of Pluto, and the rumors of where she came from. Reyna is also very strict with her, being sarcastic with her when she is late. She is against a daughter of Pluto even standing for Percy but reluctantly agrees, wrinkling her nose at the thought, and promoted her to legionnaire after she saved Dakota. As for Hazel, she respects Reyna but is uneasy around her due to being her boss, and is afraid of being punished by her.

When Nico learned that Reyna had seen his memories, Nico put his guard up. Reyna even began thinking of Nico as her younger brother in spite of herself, and wanted to give him her cloak as a blanket, but she stopped, telling herself that he was her comrade, not her brother. But by the time they made it to San Juan, Reyna had seen enough of Nico's pain that she tucked him in with her cloak anyway.

     When she was briefly taken away by the Hunters of Artemis, Nico is enraged, since he didn't want them stealing another important person from him, and ripped up the note Thalia gave him in rage. He is relieved to have finally found her again. Nico, however, is worried at how brooding Reyna had become after leaving Puerto Rico, and encourages her talk about what troubles her (much to his own surprise, since brooding was usually his own method of dealing with internal turmoil as well), reminding her of the numerous ghosts of Asphodel, who are unable to speak any longer, due to them never speaking out during their lifetimes, reminding Reyna that her voice is her identity, and that unless she uses it, she is "halfway to Asphodel already." Nico then tells Reyna about

At that moment, Nico accidentally generates a "flood of pain and anger" on everyone present, allowing Reyna to finally experience his hardships from his point of view and also see Nico's greatest fears and secrets (including his homosexuality and his crush on

Reyna was shocked at the beginning and didn’t know how to process it at first, with him reminding her of her father, but then she realized how much she trusts him and how he removed some of her burden, and said that she trusted him, healing him for 3 days. When Nico woke up, he was worried of what Reyna would think of him, and apologized to her, worried that he poisoned another friendship. But to Nico's surprise and relief, she told him how much she trusts him and how everyone lets out the darkness once in awhile, and how they are friends.She did, however made him promise to not turn someone into a ghost again. Nico realised that Reyna wasn’t judging him, but that she cared even more now that she knew who he was.

Annabeth recognized that Reyna felt betrayed by Jason, and she was too bitter, lonely and believed nothing could go right for her in the future.
