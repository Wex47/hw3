  <p key="f1aeb3a0-bb8c-454e-ab95-81d918e7b223">
   While Ouranos detested all of his children, he detested the Elder Cyclopes and Hekatonkheires so much (mainly for their ugliness) that he imprisoned them in the terrifying abyss of

   , which was itself deep within the Earth. Enraged, Gaea told her remaining twelve children (including Oceanus), the Titans, to take the mighty
   scythe
   that she had forged, and avenge their brothers by overthrowing and killing their arrogant and sadistic father. Being immortal, Oceanus initially did not even understand what "killing" meant, but the concept was quickly explained to him by Themis, his most intelligent sister. However, while Oceanus detested his father, he was ambivalent at the prospect of murdering him, and did not step up to take the scythe. Even after his youngest brother

Much later, these particles would mix with the ocean spray to form

   Pontus
   took to spending all of his time in deep slumber). Oceanus would also rule over the huge body of water that encircled the flat earth. As a result, the world's largest bodies of water began to be called "oceans", named after the eldest Titan that ruled them. Oceanus would also frequently approach his wise and clairvoyant brother

Shortly after the birth of his many children, Oceanus no longer visited Kronos on Mount Othrys, and while he claimed to be too busy, Kronos knew that the actual reason was because Oceanus secretly feared his brother's might and infamous temper.

   One evening, when Oceanus was dining with his brothers and nephews, Zeus prepared nectar mixed with sleeping potion for Oceanus, and a powerful emetic for Kronos. As before, Zeus entertained them all with his great singing, dancing, and jokes. Near the end of the Titanic banquet, Zeus encouraged all of the Titans to have yet another drinking contest, and handed out the prepared goblets. As before, Kronos won the contest, but the emetic caused him to disgorge all his swallowed children, while Oceanus was temporarily knocked out by the sleeping potion, and could not stop them from escaping.
