   Virginia

   old mansion
   and once inside thanks to Luke's handiwork, they discovered it was a deadly trap. They met
   Halcyon Green
   , a demigod son of

   , who had been imprisoned inside the mansion and became unable to speak because he had saved a girl's life in his youth with his abilities to see into the future, thus incurring the wrath of the gods. A part of Hal's curse was to bring in demigods to be eaten by the three
   leucrotae
   , who feed at sunset.
  </p>
  <p key="9c8e4634-c589-440e-be82-e4f7c20e62de">
   Luke was angered that the gods would do this to Hal and wanted to find a way to rescue him and Thalia. Hal told them that every demigod thought that at first, that they could escape, but soon realized it wasn't possible. Hal told them of a treasure that was in the mansion, assuming they came there for it, but they hadn't. They went after it anyways. Luke was magically able to break the lock and Thalia was able to claim the
   Aegis
   bracelet as a sign from Zeus, as he has a shield very similar in design. They were running out of time and ways of defeating the leucrotae until Luke discovered they could make

   Hal decided that he would sacrifice himself to give them time to escape, as he may have foreseen earlier on. But before he did, Hal had predicted Luke's dark future but left him vague answers when questioned about it. Luke didn't know what he meant, but was disturbed from what he said. Hal later gave Luke his personal diary and a
   knife
   and made Luke promise that he would learn from his mistakes, which Luke interpreted as not pushed around by the gods. When the leucrotae attacked, Hal used the

   to cause an explosion, which killed himself and two of the monsters. One leucrota escaped, but barely, which surprised Luke, but Thalia was able to use the bracelet to summon
   Aegis
   and scare the monster away, giving them enough to reach the doors, just as the mansion completely exploded.

   At some point, Thalia got injured by a monster and Luke and Annabeth wanted to rest. Given the situation, Luke took the girls to his mother's house to heal their wounds. When they approached the house, a loud voice boomed above: "You shouldn't have returned", but that didn't seem to matter to Luke. There, Luke finally meets his father, Hermes, for the first time. Luke was angry and resentful, and demanded to know why Hermes had never shown up when Luke had desperately prayed while he hid from his mother when she had fits, or when they were running from monsters. During this conversation, Hermes inadvertently revealed that he knew Luke's fate. Luke eagerly asked about it since Hal had only given him vague answers, but Hermes refused to tell him as he had already said too much. Luke then told his father that he couldn't possibly love him if he wouldn't tell him and angrily left with Thalia and Annabeth.

   When Percy and Annabeth run to the outer boundary of Night's realm, they reach the
   Acheron
   (the River of Pain). The ruthless and malevolent river shows Annabeth images of many of her friends dying. The most painful of all, however, is that of Luke sacrificing himself, and the blood on her dagger. The river blames Annabeth for not finding another way to defeat Kronos and prevent Luke's death, stating that his blood is on her hands. Annabeth begins to fear that Luke's voice is among those in the Acheron, punished for his crimes against Olympus. The river tries to force her to jump in and "share his punishment", and Annabeth nearly does, though Percy intervenes just in time.

   As a child, Luke was more selfless and moral in his youth, blaming the gods only for what he saw as injustice, such as Hermes abandoning him and not trying to help his sick mother (whose crazy antics terrified him to the point of run away from home), Zeus abandoning Thalia, and Apollo placing a curse on his son Halcyon. In

   , Luke took his new responsibility as the group's surrogate father very seriously and was determined to do a better job than his own father did with him despite his young age, constantly looking out for Thalia and Annabeth.
  </p>
  <p key="2163bc96-00c2-41fa-8fc5-014efd6595a6">
   After Halcyon makes him promise to learn from his past mistakes, Luke misunderstands this as not letting the Olympians push him around and begins to feel motivated to fight back. This is the first time he begins questioning the gods himself. Thalia's sacrifice greatly depressed him, blaming Zeus for not finding another way to save her from Hades. However, the final straw would finally come after Luke failed on his quest to retrieve a golden apple from the
   Garden of the Hesperides
   . He saw no glory in repeating what others had done and felt very unmotivated on his quest, especially since he already fought monsters until he was 14 years old and trained very hard afterwards. He felt so miserable at the gods that "wanted to pull Olympus down stone by stone", to the point Kronos felt his despair. Even Annabeth claims that Luke never was the same ever since returning from his quest.
  </p>
  <p key="301cfc49-68e6-460d-8cb9-eea32ee705f2">
   For the sake of resurrecting Kronos, Luke became crueler and callous than ever, even willing to send Percy to his certain death into Tartarus. Further demonstrations of Luke's newfound cruelty are his lack of consideration before poisoning Thalia's pine (though he did this only to have Percy resurrect her), his blackmail of Silena Beauregard, his sadistic intention to make Percy watch as his friends Tyson and Grover were devoured by an Aethiopian Drakon, and sneering at Thalia when the latter held him at the point of a sword.

  <p key="beee780c-8821-4687-a8f5-11a80350a92b">
   Like his previous friends Thalia, Annabeth and Percy, Luke had an extremely strong will worthy of a hero. He was able to hold the
   weight of the sky
   and fight Thalia head on despite her Aegis shield replica had intimidated even the likes of Ladon in

   he even fought Kronos himself for the control of his body. However, Luke can be reckless when trying to prove himself something and overconfident in his abilities, negative traits he acknowledged. Examples include when he took unnecessary risks during his travels before the Camp Half-Blood, and when he nearly got killed by Ares, saved only by Kronos's intervention.
  </p>
  <p key="f174f5cd-b421-4a41-9acd-62efc2bc3169">
   However, Luke still did seem to possess at least some morals, being furious with

   , he developed his first doubts about the Titan King's cause, to the point he visited Annabeth before the events of the book and tried to convince her to run away with him before Kronos could use his body as a host. According to Kronos himself, he "had to pressure Luke in many ways" in order to convince him to bath in the Styx. In the end, Annabeth reminds Luke of his initial promise to be a proper family, which encourages Luke to finally realize that he was mislead by Kronos the entire time. Ultimately, Luke proves that he is ultimately good at heart and chooses to sacrifice himself in order to destroy Kronos. Just before he dies, Luke makes Percy promise to never let another war like that ever happen again and selflessly pleads him to makes sure that all of the unclaimed demigods are finally claimed by their parents.

According to Annabeth, Luke was "an amazing monster-fighter, even without training." During the five years he spent at Camp Half-Blood, Luke greatly enhanced his fighting abilities.

After Percy defeated several Ares campers in Capture the Flag, only Luke was able to train him when he was augmented by water one on one. When revealing his treachery to Percy, Luke claimed he could have beaten Ares if he would had been more cautious, though this is uncertain. In

      , Luke quickly outduelled and nearly killed Percy in their duel even when the latter's power was augmented by water, though Percy was out of practice and Luke had a shield. This is impressive as at this point in time Percy was capable of defeat entire cabins at a time without water augmentation. Despite being noticeably frail from holding the sky, Luke held his own very well against Thalia, but was eventually outmatched and disarmed. It should be noted that he was at a considerable disadvantage due to Thalia's powers over lightning, though Thalia claimed she could always beat Luke.

   , Luke welcomed a newly arrived Percy Jackson into Camp Half-Blood. Kronos had informed Luke after stealing the bolt that another demigod would show up at camp soon who would take the bolt to Tartarus, so Luke made him feel comfortable, going as far as stealing toiletries for him, guiding him and giving him sword fighting lessons. Percy thought Luke was a really nice guy, but it was all a ploy to earn his trust. Luke later summoned a hellhound to attack Percy so Chiron would send him on a quest, giving him cursed sandals hoping they would drag Percy to Kronos in Tartarus. After successfully completing his quest, Luke was furious that the plan was unsuccessful while Percy, at the time, still thought they were friends. Towards the end of the summer, Luke took Percy alone into the woods and told him he was leaving camp. The conversation soon takes a darker turn when Luke summoned a pit scorpion to kill Percy and revealed that he stole the Lightning Bolt and explained his motives for serving Kronos, though Percy survived.

Each time, Luke tried to recruit Percy or kill him, and each time Percy tried to dissuade him from the madness. As the events progress, Percy grew to resent and hate Luke more and more, even wishing him to die, and the feeling is mutual for Luke. Annabeth's belief in Luke only served to increase Percy's hatred. Kronos toll Percy that Luke feared him for his power as a child of the Big Three and for his potential to ruin the Titan King's plans with his prophesied ultimate choice to save Olympus.

However, when Kronos finally manages to disarm Percy, Luke is distracted by Annabeth, who reminds him of the promise he made her about being a family, which encourages Luke to finally realize that he was mislead by Kronos the entire time. Luke manages to regain control over his body and takes Annabeth's knife from Percy (the cursed blade of the Great Prophecy), and stabs himself in his Achilles heel (his armpit).
