   Eunhee

Min gets them to reveal that the Investigator revealed that his departure location and business on Jinju was classified, worrying her about her brother. They also reveal that the Space Forces have various ships around the
   Ghost Sector

   She considers going back for it but decides against it as it would be too risky. She makes her way to the

   Red Azalea

   Captain Hye
   , willing to take on working passengers. It says the captain can be found at Nari's and she reluctantly goes. Min finds a fox statue out front and, knowing people think of them as bad luck, wonders what it's doing there. A woman welcomes her to the tavern and both realize that other is a fox. The woman drags Min to the back office and smells her mother and aunts on her. The woman introduces herself as
   Nari
   , a relative of hers. She reveals that she and her mother opens the bar and were shunned by the family for it. She asks Min to work for her for a little while and Min, wanting to song Hye as soon as possible, reluctantly agrees until she can give her aunt the slip. She charms herself to a look like she was wearing a form blouse, pants, shoes, and gold jewellery and gets to work as
   Yong
   , a bouncer, keeps tabs on her. As she brings a drink she learns that the wine is charmed to make people lose. Min is shocked by this and wonders if this is why her mother left. She slips into the high stakes room and learns that Hye is on a losing streak and tells her that if she accepts an employee on her ship then Nari will declare her debt-free and the captain accepts. However soon after she sees Nye being dragged to Nari's office and, fearing she will be exposed, charms herself to look like she was wearing a spacesuit and a flatter face. Yong runs into her and, due to her age, helps her get away and she makes her way to the Red Azalea.

He agrees and, after telling the other crew to stay hidden, he takes Min to the cockpit and they take off. She tells him that she is escaping poverty when Byung-Ho asks about her. As they pass through a gate, she sees a vision of her father that morphs into a tiger. Byung-Ho snaps her out of it and gives her a tour of the ship. After he has her clean and she falls asleep. She dreams of Jun on the white planet, standing on the edge of a cliff. Byung-Ho wakes her and tells her the just jumped through the second gate, but are under attack by raiders. He mans the weapons while Min flies, which she has never done. As the fighting breaks out he has her go to the engine room to do repairs.

Min offers to take his place and reveals herself as a fox. He is unphased by this and accepts the offer if she can find out more about the mercenaries that killed him. She swears on her ancestor's bones, a serious oath, and accepts. The medic comes in and she turns into Jang and uses charm to trick the medic. Min asks about Byung-Ho and the medic says he is still in a stasis pod but will be fine. She leaves when the examination is done. Min wonders around the ship until she runs into a

Sujin and Haneul goes with Min and the dokkaebi gives her cookies and shrimp crackers to snack on. She decides to stay close to the two for the time being, since they know Jang well. After performing Jang's duties, she misranks an officer and cleans the latrines as a result. She charms a cadet who comes into the latrines into giving her a layout of the Pale Lighting, she arrives late to the barracks and Ju-Won has Jang wake up two hours earlier if more latrine cleaning. When she finishes she heads to the mess hall to get food and meets up with Haneul and Sujin. They get in line to eat and she overs hears two human girls asking each other why the human Jang would hang out with supernaturals. After mess, they head to

Haneul and Sujin soon arrive and mess around with Jang. She later looks through Jang's trunk and the ghost looks at the objects with sorrow.

Min winces that she might be discovered but goes with them to a game area of the Pale Lightning. Jang and Haneul play and she allows Jang a handicap of extra peace. During the game, she uses charm and asks about Jun. The others say he probably left to find the dragon pearl. They comment that, despite not knowing him well, Jun was a loyal soldier and was surprised he deserted. They say Jun's bunkmates were interrogated heavily and she decides to ask them if she can. They don't think he was the mastermind behind it as another of the deserters was a lieutenant. They also find it strange as it would be easy for the Pale Lighting to find him. Haneul wins and she heads back to the barracks. She finds Jang, angry that she is doing nothing to find out what happened to him. She apologizes, saying she would do it and he leaves.

   The next morning at breakfast, he asks Sujin and Hanuel about the pirate attack, they say none of them survived and that they might have thought the Red Azalea was another mercenary ship and attacked it thinking it ha the Dragon Pearl. After breakfast and before KP duty, she tells Jang that all the pirates died in the attack. He is disappointed but accepts this and leaves. During Hyosu's lesson on the engines, she pulls Jang aside and compliments him on his work. Early the next morning she wakes up and checks out Jun's bunk but does not find his scent. When a sergeant finds her Jang says "he" woke up early and decided to go for a walk. For this, Jang is stuck with hydroponics, growing plants in liquid rather than soil, along with Haneul and Sujin. She is helped in looking for rot by a human ensign name
   Woo-Jin
   who she recognized from Jun's barracks. She charmed him to get information on her brother, but he said he told Hwan everything he knew. A warrant officer told them to help Haneul and she goes. The dragon tells her the ship's meridian on the third level is giving off bad luck and, after faking a stomachache to get out of a fencing match, she checks it out. She charms both guards standing at each end of the hall and goes in. She twisted her ankle and has a stomach pain due to the negative gi, life energy, and hides in a closet when she hears Captain Kwan and
   Lieutenant Commander Ju-Eun
   . As they talk Kwan says he thinks there is a ghost on board, worrying Min. Ji-Eun suggests it might be pirates but Kwan brushes it off. They suggest that it might be a prank before talking about the deserters and that if they were found, will be court marshaled. Ju-Eun heads back to the bridge and Kwan calls Jang out of the closet. He says "he" was curious and wanted to see the meridian for himself and distracted a guard and hid. He quizzes Jang on "his" background before he says he feared for his life in the pirate attack. He says Jang will get used to it in time and dismisses the "cadet". When the captain is out of sight Jang appears and she tells him that Hwan at least sent him in knowing it was too dangerous. She asks him if he would curse the ship, he denies it after a pause and vanishes.

   She and Sujin head up to the bridge to learn the layout and functions of it. The two are told to go to an ensign in charge of navigation. The ensign quizzes them on what not to do while travelling through a gate. Min then realizes that her brother and the other deserters would have had to leave the ship via escape pod, something deadly while in a gate, and realizes there is someone she must ask to make sense of it.

   Min decides to sneak into Hwan's quarters to find answers She decides to use litmus film to copy Hwan's fingerprints. However soon after the ship exits a gate and comes under attack by ten mercenary ships. Jang and Sujin head to the engine room and she helps the chief engineer with a broken meridian, but takes over Sujin's panel position when they are injured. Jang aligns her gi with the ship but is soon injured and blacks out. She wakes up in the medical bay and, despite her body hurting, made her way to Hwan's quarters. She uses the litmus film to fake Hwan's fingerprint and to get the code to his office. She is successful and enters. She finds Jun's scent on a sword in the background and looks through his desk. She finds old fashioned paper logbooks and reads through the most recent one. She reads that Hwan knows where the dragon pearl is and sent Jun and others on a mission to the
   Fourth Colony
   to retrieve it. He also wrote that he knows Jun is a Fox Spirit and selected him for it, as he felt he had the best chance to complete the mission and plans to use the pearl to destroy worlds. Min decides to go to the Fourth Colony to find her brother. She finds a map in the book and memorizes it before putting it away. She heads back to the medical bay and falls asleep.

After the medic says he was the only survivor they save, she uses charm and tells him Bora survived, he tells Jang to tell Bora she was a good mechanic and to peruse it. Hwan appears over the loudspeakers and announces the battle is over and they have taken prisoners. She goes to the brig and is joined by Jang. They get the access code from a pair of soldiers and make it to the brig to find Pox Spirits. As the two spy on the interrogation, the learn that the mercenaries were hired by Councilor Chae-Won of the Jeweled Worlds to ensure a monopoly on terraforming. When the interrogation ends they sneak out and Jang is assigned a desk job by Ju-Won. She meets up with Haneul and Sujin for dinner. She learns that in two days the Pale Lightning will stop on

   Min sneaks into the damaged meridian after charming the guards. She uses a blaster to destroy some wires before going to the brig. She disguises herself as Hwan before telling the guards present to release the prisoners and leave. The three prisoners, a male scholar, a light faced man, and a woman with scarred hands exit and she reveals herself as a fox spirit. She offers to help them escape if they take them to the Ghost Sector. They agree and the four make their way to the mercenaries' ship. She charms everyone they see to avoid unnecessary conversations. They reach the ship and the mercenaries inspect it before takeoff. Hwan's voice comes over the speakers, telling them to come back to the Pale Lightning or die. They blast a hole in the airlock and escape. She imitates Hwan's voice to cause momentary confusion among the crew. As the Pale Lightning fires a missile, they maneuver it to hit the Space Forces ship. The mercenaries open a gate and escape. The scholar,
   Chul
   , suggests they get the Dragon Pearl and use it for themselves. After exiting the gate she reverts to her human form for the first time in weeks. They learn they only have two jumps left. They open a gate to the Fourth Colony and it is white rather than the normal purple. She sees visions of a tiger and dragon fighting and they successfully reach the Fourth Colony.

   However, the Pale Lighting beat them there and the ship is taken out by an electromagnetic pulse. With life support of the four put on space suits to make oxygen last longer and set up false traps to try the Space Forces. They are soon boarded by Sujin and Haneul. Kwan tells them to surrender or he will execute the two cadets for treason. Min surrenders to save them. Her former comrades say nothing to her and Jang leaves. She is brought before Hwan and she tells him her name when he asks. When he says he heard of her from her brother she demands to know Jun’s fate. He has her put in solitary where the guards are ordered to shoo if she shapeshifts. Later Hwan shows up and she turns into a fox, her true form, at his request. He offers her a deal to get her freedom and her brother if she Han charm her way past the ghosts of the Fourth Colony. He says Jun is hidden away and he can reunite them if she cooperates. She declines and Kwan leaves her. Later Sujin, who snick in while Hwan was talking with her, frees her. They have her turn into Hyosu and lead her to the escape pods where Haneul is standing guard. The three get in and head to the Fourth Colony, however, the pod short circuits and they drift somewhat. Min tells them Jang died saving the Red Azalea and he gave her permission to use his form. She manages to fix it and hopes to arrive on the planet safely. The pod heats up as they head to the planet's surface, albeit crashing into a forest where the trees break their fall. They take a survey pad, survival kit, and medical kit, and check to see if the air is breathable. She gets out after Haneul and gets poked by thorns in the way down. They are soon haunted by ghosts. When Sujin lands they have a quick snack and head in the direction the ghosts do not want them going.

   As they march on they get caught in the rain. Min has a vision of ghosts telling her to find shelter. Sujin and Haneul snap her out of it and are soon approached by a familiar figure. They realize it is Jun and, much to her dismay, he is a ghost. She is saddened by this and Haneul comforts her. Jin leads them to his ship where they meet other ghosts. When they tell that Hwan recruited them to find the Dragon Pearl, Min and the other living beings realize the ghosts are using them as bait to lure Hwan to them. After realizing this she is alarmed when Sujin has warned him not to come to them. The ghosts then come at them. She fakes having to use the bathroom, using charm for good measure, and has Haneul a company her while Sujin wears their invisibility hat. The three flee and make camp by a bolder and some dead saplings for cover. Hanuel takes first watch as she and Sujin rest. Sujin tells her they were lying about contacting Hwan, but knows the tiger will come down regardless. They both fall asleep and Haneul wakes her. As she keeps watch Jun arrives and tells her he was going to help them escape later and he knows where the Dragon Pearl is. She wakes her friends and explains the plan to them and they four set out.

   The four encounter a hoard of ghosts of both civilians and Space Force personnel, the hoard points out that Hwan is landing and leaps at them. Min knows where the Dragon Pearl is and, leaving her friends, goes to retrieve it. She turns into a hawk as Jun shields her from the ghosts. She gets the Dragon Pearl but sees Hwan pointing a blaster at her. She dives a Hwan and the tiger shoots at her shoulder and she falls to the ground and reverts to human form. Hwan demands the dragon pearl and a ghost,
   Eui

   Shaman
   who brought the Dragon Pearl to the Fourth Colony. They say the shaman was selfish in her desires but Min promises to give them all a proper funeral. She orders Hwan to let her friends go, but she realizes the two were working with Hwan the entire time. She is hurt but understanding, saying Jang gave her permission to take his form, Jane then materializes to confirm what she is saying. She then starts the process. Hwan tries to grab the Dragon Pearl from her but stops when Eui mentions his long-dead comrade. Eui has the four living beings swear on the bones of a dead loved one, Jun for her, and the Fourth colony springs to life. Before Jang leaves he asks that he get a military funeral, she and the others promise to give him that. When they finish the ghosts that die with trying to get the Dragon Pearl the first time attack Hwan and drag him into a forest. Jun stays, saying he still wants to see the Thousand Worlds, Min agrees to this.

   Security Officer Seok
   of the Thousand Worlds Domestic Security Ministry, the same man who informed her family of Jun’s desertion two months prior. He tries to take the Dragon Pearl, saying it is property of the Dragon Council, but it fires a beam at him and singes his hair before Min snatches it back. Min states that she wants to use the dragon pearl to terraform worlds at a reasonable price. He then states her crimes and her heroism and offers her a position in the Thousand Worlds Domestic Security Ministry, as it can Shield her from the Dragon Council and the Space Forces. She agrees if Jun can be her partner, Seok agrees after getting over the initial shock of seeing a ghost.

Min reluctantly agrees and shapeshifts into a sixteen-year-old after Seok says she needs to hide her age, as well as not tell anyone she is a fox spirit.

After putting on vacuum suits and taking out a forcefield generator, Min suggests it is a problem with the meridian and the headmaster,
   Commandant Paik

Bina gives the report and Piak reveals it was a test. After explaining how she takes drills a step further, she asks Min if she has any supernatural heritage, however Hansoo replays for her, and the Commandant dismisses the three. Hansoo shows Min to her quarters. When he leaves, Min tells Jun she thinks Piak is hiding something. Soon after Hansoo returns to gets her to introduce her to the rest of the trainees in their group,

She talks to Jun, but he quickly vanishes. Min panics and thinks there is some kind anti ghost enchantment on the school and notices Duri has grown more. Soon they revert to their true form with Min noticing the same thing happening to her and Chinsun. Min asks Jun what is happening, but he doesn't know and leaves just in case he is causing it. After her fox form is revealed the others are shocked to learn what she is, but they need all the help they can get and pay her little attention. They hear animal sounds and human screams from the other shuttle bays as Min says her handler wanted her heritage to be a secret. The group leaves, with Duri's emense size forcing them to stay behind, and they find other supernaturals panicking after being forced into their true forms. A trainee from a different group notices Min but thinks she is a dog. Min asks Jun, who has undergone a change in appearance, and the others notice him as well. They panic but calm down slightly when Min says he is her brother. Eventually they realize they forced transformations and loss of control might have something to do with the artifacts keeping the institute in orbit and agree to inform the Commandant.

   describes Min as an anti-hero in a fair description. She's clever and determined, but her main solution to trouble is to lie or trick her way out of it.
   Min cares deeply about her family, especially her brother, and her friends like Sujin and Haneul, as well as even people she doesn't know very well such as Byung-ho if they prove themselves to mean well. She dislikes having to do chores and spent most of her childhood longing to explore all the different planets of the Thousand Worlds, an interest shared by her brother. Min is a naturally distrustful person, and good at improvising on the spot, especially with her power of Charm, but she finds some value in being honest and stating her goals upfront by the end of Dragon Pearl.
