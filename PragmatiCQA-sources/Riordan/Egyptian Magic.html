   This type of magic is used by Apophis, Setne, Amos Kane, and Sadie Kane. It is done by lacing one's words with magic so that it persuades the target to do what the magician wants. To do this, you need to exert your magic on your target. Despite the imminent threat of Apophis and resurrecting Ra, Amos calmed down the initiates of Brooklyn House with magical persuasion. Later, Setne used it to get Sadie to tell Julius/Osiris to release Setne although it didn't work as Julius/Osiris was aware of the ghost's powers.

   Setne also tried to get Carter to let down his guard with magical persuasion but Horus alerted Carter, since gods are seemingly immune to a mortal using it. Apophis also has a specialty of magical persuasion and it is so potent that the victim doesn't realize what he is doing until it is too late, such as with Kwai and Vlad Menshikov. It is so great that Face of Horror, hosting a tiny fraction of Apophis' power, almost succeeded in getting Set to destroy the world.

   This magic is used to go from one place to the other. However, it is very difficult and therefore, is usually done with artifacts, even those that aren't from Ancient Egypt but are replicas. It can also be done with anything in the shape of a pyramid or obelisk. A portal is described a swirling vortex of sand. A portal cannot be used in the Demon Days unless using the power of a god or goddess of magic like Isis or Thoth.

   Transformation, also known as morphing, is magic used by magicians to transform their body into another using magic. This is done only for a short period of time as sustained transformations can result in the magician being unable to change back. It can also result in a magician burning up from staying too long. If following the path of a god, or hosting one, the magician usually assumes the form of the god's sacred animal. For example, Carter can transform into a falcon while Sadie can morph into a kite. When transforming via the power of the gods, the magician can stay longer in the morphed state although it is much more difficult to change back. This is evidenced when Carter had trouble transforming back and Sadie was stuck as a kite for a while. The more experience a magician has with this, the less power it seems to require as when Carter was near-exhaustion in

   This is a version of Transformation that is used by magicians to transform another person's body into something else using magic. This is done by overpowering the person's will and morphing them. Typically, magicians transform the target into an animal they know since it requires less energy. When used via the power of the gods, the magician can gain enough strength to forcefully transform another god into whatever they want. This was shown when Carter, after becoming the Eye of Horus, overpowered Set's will and forcefully morphed him into a fruit bat although it wasn't very long since Set overcame the transformation. Carter was also able to turn
