    Riley Oh can't wait to see her sister get initiated into the Gom clan—a powerful lineage of Korean healing witches their family has belonged to for generations. Her sister, Hattie, will earn her Gi bracelet and finally be able to cast spells without adult supervision. Although Riley is desperate to follow in her sister's footsteps when she herself turns thirteen, she's a saram— a person without magic. Riley was adopted, and despite having memorized every healing spell she's ever heard, she often feels like the odd one out in her family and the gifted community.

Their sleuthing reveals a promising incantation in the family's old spellbook, and the sisters decide to perform it at Hattie's initiation ceremony. If it works, no one will ever treat Riley as an outsider again. It's a perfect plan!

Riley thinks back to what she was told happened when her parents persuaded the elders to put her in the cauldron, after a delayed reaction she was revealed to have four fire elements, astonishing as it was unheard of for some to have all the same element as it only repeated twice, before catching fire itself. Before service ends and the children go to Saturday school, Mr. Pyo tells the congregation that the library will reopen for the first time in decades and the carnival will be soon. He also warns them that the Horongi clan, a clan of scholarly witches stripped of their power and banished for trying too gain to much power and attacking the elders, has made contact with the council and they warn the congregation to be careful as they believe they are planning another attack on the council. As Riley and Hattie head to Sunday school, Riley questions if they should use the spell of not when their aunt Okja comes up to apologize for failing to get her an initiation and leaving to talk to another elder.

They have all the ingredients to make the potion, but Riley becomes disheartened upon learning they must do the spell in the presence of an elder and the other half of the potion must be used in the Gi cauldron. Hattie then suggests they do the spell during her initiation. Just then Emmett comes in and expresses concern over the dangers of using the spell between two witches, but the sisters brush him off.

After Hattie receives her Gi bracelet and recite the proper stanzas, the sisters put their plan into action as the congregation looks on in stock. Okja manages to halt the ritual before it can be completed by revealing that Riley is not a saram, but a member of the exiled Horangi Clan. As the entire congregation watches on in shock, Riley begs her parents to say Okja is lying, but they only confirm what she said. They reveal her true origins to Riley and the entire congregation is is disbelief. The other four elders decide to have Okja and the Ohs make a choice by the end of the week, either all five will be excommunicated and stripped of their magic or just Riley will be banished. As soon as the choice is laid out for them, Riley runs, but not before Mr. Pyo tells her her family will be monitored.

Taeyo gives her his compass, as he saw how she used her request to help Emmett, as blades come out of it and they go to help.

   They reach the inmyeonjo to find her trapped in a cage by a lake and Sora asking for volunteers to tame it, two eight year olds,
   Henry
   and
   Grace

   Jo
   try. He takes his lighter out and tries to attack it, however the bird woman simply sends it back he catches fire, jumping into the lake before the bird woman says she will not be tamed. After Jo, a pair of identical twin sisters
   Yumi
   and
   Yuri
   , a wood and earth user respectively, try their hands together but end up helping the other escape. After them Riley is introduced to the crowd as a Horangi taken by the Gom and given Jo's lighter. As the bird woman taunted her, Riley thinks of ways to use her fire after the methods of Taeyo and Austin fail. When the bird woman taunts her about the situation not being fair, she gets angry and, realizing anger is her method. She shoots flames at the bird woman before they die down before reaching her. After she is injured by a talon and starts to cry, she notices a cut from the fight with the twins and she offers to heal it. She cautiously gets flowers with healing purposes and grinds them up before applying the ointment to the wound and says the bird woman is beautiful. After she says she does not have a name, Riley named her
   Areum
   , Korean for "beauty". Areum shrinks to the size of a dove and Sora declares that Riley has tamed the inmyeonjo. After asking if she would join the clan, she accepts and everyone congratulates her. She searches the crowd for Emmett and finds him with Okja and her adoptive parents.

   The Ohs, Okja, Sora, Austin, Taeyo, and Emmett movie to a shed at Riley hugs her parents, they say they had a Samjogo seer track her down and Emmett filled them in. James and Euhna accuse the Horangi of kidnapping and brainwashing Riley as they reveal she joined of her own free will. They keep fighting until Riley reveals her speculation that Okja framed the Horangi, she denies it but says she is far from incinerator. When the Horangi call her a murderer, she explains her theory that Bongjoon Pyo, the Sanjogo elder, is actually behind everything. She reveals that the claimed to have a vision of Sora breaking into the temple, but it changed every time he told it and that he would communicate with the Godrealm alone rather than with the other elders. The group forms an uneasy alliance and heads to Los Angeles. The eight and Areum head to the Los Angeles headquarters for the
   Woori America Bank
   , where  Mr. Pyo works as chairman of the board. Taeyo hacks his calendar to get them an appointment as relatives. Areum waits outside as the rest simply walk in a get to the top floor after revealing their appointment by the secretary. They find Mr. Pyo in a meeting with executives, when he sees them he runs and they give chase, jumping over objects he throws in their path and following him down the emergency exit to his car. He takes out a wooden bat, which Sora splits in two before Austin unscrews a fire hydrant and Taeyo douses him with the water. He surrenders and they ask him why he framed the Horangi. Mr. Pyo reveals that Sookhee Harrison was behind it, and he framed the Horangi to cover his own tracks. As he says it, he realizes that Sookhee was possessed by the
   Cave Bear Goddess
   , who wanted to destroy the artifacts, which were made out of the dark sun and dark moon and are evidence of their sin, so that they could walk the Mortalrealm and do what they please with humanity. The others find him hard to believe but Riley believes him. After realizing the goddesses can possess the members of the clans they represent, Riley asks if it is possible to sever the Gom's ties to their patron goddess. Okja mentions a spell does exist, but James and Euhna are not sure if they are willing, but agree to help. Just then Areum arrives and tells them the
   Dokkaebi
   , a creature who eats nightmares and can summon anything from the Godrealm for a price, know where the object is.

   Uneasy after hearing what they have to do to find the last fallen star, and where they would even find one, Mr. Pyo says one lives in the forty-fourth room on the forty-fourth floor of the temple. The Samjogo elder is left behind as the others go to the temple. After stopping by Mrs. Lee's house to get a sleeping potion, they go to the room and argue about who will go in. In the end the Ohs and Areum go in and Eunha takes the potion to make a deal with the dokkaebi. She wakes up sobbing ten minutes later after the goblin forced her to pay for the star with the life of one of her daughters. As James comforts her, Riley asks Areum to knock her out and she reluctantly obeys. She wakes up alone and searches the room, after a few seconds the Dookaebi comes out and she asks for the last fallen star. He demands that she give him her dominant element, meaning she would lose her gifted mark and can never perform magic. After a short hesitation she quickly agrees, but he also demands that all members of the Gom and Horangi, her adoptive and birth families, forget her, something she greatly fears. After thinking it over, and finding that Hattie's heart is now mostly black, she agrees and as he summons the star, he reveals she already possesses it. He vanishes before she can ask what he means and sobs at what she sacrificed.

   Riley wakes up to find the others in the room as Areum greets her. She hopes the bargain was only a dream, but her fears are confirmed when no one recognizes her. She tells them what the dokkaebi told her, and they become suspicious of how she knows their plan. She gives Emmett back his ring and shows Taeyo his compass. After seeing the compass and remembering the last two lines of the prophecy, she believes it is the fallen star. After Boris wags his tail, they believe her and they head to the Gi sanctuary. They find it abandoned, but are soon visited by the
   Cave Bear Goddess
   . She congratulates Riley on finding the last fallen star and asks her to hand it over. Riley slyly asks for Hattie back just as her heart blackens and the goddess obeys. As Hattie is returned, with skinny limbs and a gray hue to her skin, Riley and their parents run up to her and hug her, however Riley senses something is off. Hattie starts to move unnaturally as she turns to Emmett and speaks in his mother's voice. Sookhee apologizes for her actions, saying the goddess promised to give him magic if she let her use her body. After explaining how she was finally able to break free of her anger and guilt and telling Emmett he is loved, she turns into a jaguar and moves on to the afterlife. Riley berates the goddess for tricking her, which she brushes off by saying that she and her sisters are the daughters of Mago Halmi and all others are beneath them. At that Okja starts the spell to sever the Cave Bear Goddess from the Gom. Threads link them as Riley goes to cut the threads, but fails and realizes the compass is not the star. The goddess berates Riley for betraying her as Riley reminds her she is powerless in the Mortalrealm without a host. At that she starts to pull Okja towards her as everyone in the room tries to pull the elder away, they fail and the goddess possesses Okja.

   The goddess sends James flying into the Gom pews as his wife heals him. Austin does what he can to stop the goddess without hurting Okja, but is thrown into Taryo. Sora tries to stop her, but struggles to contain the goddess as Riley is picked up by
   Noah Noh
   who takes her to
   Jennie Byun
   ,
   Cosette Chung
   , and
   David Kim
   , who came because Jennie had a vision that they were needed. Cosette creates an illusion of Okja on herself to confuse the goddess while David and Jennie douse the goddess in an immobilization potion. As the goddess is under the affects of the potion and the others fight to contain her, Riley feelings an unnatural warmth in her as the
   Gi Cauldron
   erupts in black flames. When the goddess breaks free, Riley confronts her as the goddess slams the girl into her statue, which causes Riley to finally understand what the last two lines of the prophecy were. She reveals to the goddess that she is in fact the Last Fallen Star and destroys the Cave Bear Goddess's statue with the black fire, expelling the goddess from Okja's body and from the Mortalrealm.

   As everyone takes in what just happened, Riley's parents go back to mourning their daughter as the others talk amongst themselves. Riley cries thinking about what she will do if her family doesn’t remember her and goes to the elevator with Areum, their she meets the
   Haetae
   again, who reveals the he was the guard who found her and Emmett in the library. He shows Riley a memory of her as the last fallen star landing in her mother's womb. The haetae warns her that the remaining five goddesses will seek vengeance on her before she is given a Winston reverse anything from her past. After wondering if she should use it to restore her magic or the her loved one's memories of her, she decides to resurrect Hattie. After asking if she is sure, he agrees and says their are other ways for her families to regain their memories of her. The haetae vanishes and, after a few seconds delay, Hattie is revived and remembers Riley. Everyone cheers and Noah hugs Hattie, before moving away. They all agree to find a way to regain their Gom and Horangi's memories of Riley as they fill Hattie in.

   When the goddesses had the dark sun and dark moon removed from the Godrealm, Mago Halmi had the Haetae break the last piece into two to ensure their safety. She foretold the if the two pieces were reunited, a new age, the Age of the Final Eclipse, will begin as prophesied. The haetae obeyed, hidden one piece in the Mortalrealm and the other in the safest place he could think of, the Spiritrealm.
