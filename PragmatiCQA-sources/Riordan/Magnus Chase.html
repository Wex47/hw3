   , a mortal. Natalie and Frey met at the Blue Hills and had a summer fling, and he destroyed her at Stone skipping. Natalie had good memories of Frey and had no hard feelings when they broke up. She said her relationship with him was perfect, except that she didn't have her son yet, She found out she was pregnant with Magnus soon after, and was elated. She had no pictures of him and never revealed his identity to Magnus. When Magnus was born, she named him after a Swedish king.

   When Magnus was six years old, he attended thanksgiving at the
   Chase Mansion
   , with his mother, his uncle

    Annabeth Chase
   </a>
   . The three Chase siblings got into an argument and he and Annabeth hid in the library, while the others argued. They played with dominoes, which were actually Runes, and Annabeth made a model of the Parthenon with them. Annabeth told him he was lucky he lived with his mom, and said she was going to run away. Frederick then came and took Annabeth, saying he was leaving, and she told Magnus to be safe. After the thanksgiving, his mother told him to stay away from Randolph, and to never give him what he wants. Magnus never learned what they argued about, but he never saw his uncle for another nine years. His mom would only mention him when they were riding past his house, and she would tell him to avoid it.
  </p>
  <p key="3ede649f-53e0-42fe-833a-bb188d52d506">
   Years before he became an einherjar, Magnus suffered from asthma and would have asthma attacks, feeling like an invisible belt was constricting around his chest. His mom would hold him while they happened. She would take him outside, which helped him. His mom also made his room as plain as possible, because it was hard for him to sleep indoors unless he had total darkness and no distraction.
  </p>
  <p key="d8566b33-e71d-430f-92b2-9a0c9655ca53">
   When Magnus was eight, he and his mother went on a vacation to Mount Washington in
   New Hampshire
   where they hiked to the top and had a park ranger take their picture.  In the second grade, he had a teacher who taped his left hand to his desk in order to force him to write with his right hand, this caused his mother to yell at his teacher.
  </p>
  <p key="489c0e63-942b-44cb-af4b-2b91a28fbeff">
   When Magnus was ten, his mother had started dating a hunter who taught Magnus how to skin animals. Magnus had cut his left palm in a failed attempt at using a hunting knife, which left a deep scar. His mother got extremely angry at the hunter for causing this incident, and broke up with him soon after.
  </p>
  <p key="a24edc9e-c4c4-481f-bdae-cb61edf9b9fe">
   That same year, Magnus and his mom went hiking in the blue hills. They stopped at Houghton's pond to skip stones across the River, and his mom beat him with four stone skips when Magnus only got three. She told Magnus a bit about his dad, saying she met him there, on a summer day just like that. Magnus asked her what happened to him, and Natalie said that's why she brought him there, and said he was all around them. Magnus was confused, and she ruffled his hair and raced him to the beach.
  </p>
  <p key="c262c1d4-2330-46bd-af1f-8d48bef76711">
   At age twelve, Magnus had his first kiss with a girl named
   Jackie Molotov
   , which happened behind the bleachers at a school dance. Years later, he thought it was sad that it was his only kiss, and that it reminded him of getting mouth to mouth from a goat.
  </p>
  <p key="def16d0d-f702-47e6-a0c0-ef66eb9f6d1b">
   Magnus's mom taught him survival skills, how to navigate, camp, and make a fire, and every weekend, she would take her Subaru and drive to parks, mountains, and lakes. A few months before she died, she was in a hurry. Magnus didn't want to go out that weekend, but she insisted and said they needed to make the most of their time together, as if she was preparing for her death.
  </p>
  <p key="8dcee57a-3c5d-4326-9250-8dd15dda0855">
   Magnus went to a public high school in Allston for a few months before he dropped out due to his mom's death. On his first day, he was overwhelmed by the hallways at school and thought they were chaos, and that the cafeteria was like a piranha's den.

   When Magnus was fourteen, his mother was murdered by several "wolves with glowing blue eyes" (sent by

   ). His mother ordered him to stay away from his Uncle Randolph before her death, an order which Magnus dutifully obeyed. Since then, he has been living on the streets. Magnus became friends with two homeless people:

  <p key="0905effc-c3af-4192-a41a-3c7638df69d5">
   During this time he would frequently lie to the police and truant officers about his name and has tried alcohol. Magnus would also steal money from people passing by, but only if they did things like park in a handicap parking space or were rude to others. He would also pick up barbering skills during this time. He became close friends with the owner of
   Fadlan’s Falafel

   Abdel Fadlan

   Magnus is a white teenage boy with hair parted in the middle, hanging to his jawline in a curtain of tangled, dirty blond. He has gray eyes, much like Annabeth's, which have a haunted, scary emptiness to them, a look that had served him well when he'd lived on the streets. Initially, Magnus was quite scrawny, with a concave chest, sticking-out ribs and very pale skin, to the point that his blue veins were clearly visible. He also had a scar of his left palm, where he'd cut himself on a hunting knife as a child.

   , Magnus, while still lean and pale, became considerably more muscular, with his arms being better-defined, his skin smoother, less translucent, with all the scars, rashes, nicks and bites that came from living on the street completely disappearing. Magnus describes the transformation as not nearly as dramatic as turning into Captain America, but very similar.

  <p key="61d6085e-ba16-41ec-8fbd-b8f0ca3b228f">
   Magnus is witty, caring, smart, sneaky, and has a funny, sarcastic sense of humor. He is also really street smart from living on the streets for two years. He feels he has an obligation to protect those in danger, like he did on the Charles bridge while facing Surt.
  </p>
  <p key="4f01434c-5d0d-406b-83a1-c36fe5f9bbda">
   However, he is somewhat cynical and shares Percy's tendency to make snide remarks both internally and vocally. He initially cannot stand the fact that he was turned into an Einherji and being dragged into his fate as a son of Frey and being forced into a world he knew nothing about until recently, but gradually grows more accustomed and comfortable with his new life to the point that he respectfully declines Odin's offer to let him live a human life again.
  </p>
  <p key="6b08ebdd-4a3a-48b0-9f16-0cf3f0db174a">
   Despite living on the streets and being forced to eat out of dumpster bins to survive, Magnus is also rather health conscious, showing incredible disgust upon learning that dwarves evolved from maggots to the point that he's unable to say it comfortably.

   Unlike most demigods, he lacks a natural combat instinct, but is instead much better at thinking and talking out his problems (such as his negotiations with Ran for Sumarbrander), much like his cousin Annabeth. Nevertheless, like most demigods he is often forced into situations where he has to kill first and ask questions later, which he shows great flexibility in tactics and is a good reflexive thinker. Magnus is also very generous, he gives his extra mortal currency and Otis's disguise clothes to homeless guys in

   When they first met, Alex was in the form of a cheetah and ran over his feet. She also decapitated Magnus in order to save him during one of the battle games. Magnus also was initially confused when he found about that Alex was genderfluid and transgender and started staring at her when she revealed it to everyone. But subsequently they started getting comfortable with each other as both of them have a sarcastic attitude, both were homeless at some point in time and they both come from rich families which they chose to leave and ignore, thus Magnus can relate to her experiences. Magnus was also the least doubtful of Alex's motives when she came to in Valhalla. By the end of

   , Alex and Magnus become closer, and flirt with each other, somewhat, throughout the book. When they were travelling through the Ice Realm, they huddled in pairs to stay warm. Alex chose Magnus because he's 'warm and summery'. As they are walking through, Alex stops abruptly, as Magnus tells her to keep moving. She then turns to him, under the blanket they had, and kissed him. She said, "I wasn't going to die without doing that” and continued forward. In the Thunder Dome, Alex pretends as if it never happened, and continues to treat Magnus like before. Sam then asks Magnus whether he was going to talk to Alex about the kiss, as Magnus was apparently bad at keeping it a secret. Magnus avoids the question, and Sam, Alex and Magnus set out for

   . Alex suggests holding hands, but as Hearthstone cast an invisibility tune on them, Sam purposefully doesn’t hold Magnus's hand. He states that it isn't probably because of religious reasons, but just to have Alex and him to hold hands, saying that he could 'hear' her smiling. When flyting with Loki, Magnus changes directions and starts to compliment his friends. As he reaches Alex, she states "Saving the best for last". Magnus then unintentionally blurts out that Alex Fierro kissed him and it was the greatest thing that ever happened to him.

After some small talk, Alex once again states that he doesn't know yet and starts to walk out the door, when he turns around and goes back to Magnus, kissing him once more. He again says that he doesn't know, winks, and walks out the door. This leaves Magnus in shock as half of his brain was questioning his sexuality, and the other half was very pleased.

   Magnus then opens up the "Chase Space", a place for homeless teens, with Alex, Hearth and Blitz also co-running. As the home celebrates the Fourth of July, Magnus and Alex were on the roof terrace watching the fireworks. Alex then grabs Magnus's hand, holding it in hers. She states that this is nice, however, Magnus is unsure about which part. Because he feels that everything was nice, he agrees.

      Both have good relationships with horses due to their godly parents (horses are sacred to Frey, and Poseidon created horses).
     </li>
     <li key="8dd91063-ac7a-4c82-90ec-bc83879ac267">
      Their presences have both been seen as bad omens because of a prophecy.
     </li>
     <li key="14b1d015-db7e-4ab7-aac9-ab731d76eab2">
      Both have crossed into other worlds (Magnus has been to six of the Nine Worlds, excluding Midgard. Percy has been to the Underworld, Olympus, and Tartarus).

      Both have battled several giants (Magnus has killed three giants and battled Surt twice. Percy has battled several Hyperborean giants during the Battle of Manhattan, killed Polybotes with help from Terminus, killed Otis and Ephialtes with help of Jason Grace, and killed them again with the help of Poseidon).

     <li key="024e32a6-dc12-4717-a5b9-7064a773c546">
      Both have a grandfather they don't like (Percy's grandfather is Kronos who tried to destroy him, and Magnus' grandfather is Njord, who was unhelpful).

     <li key="cb945a7c-1ffc-4d22-917f-d523765dc51c">
      Both of them have a sword that was a gift from their father (Chiron was given Riptide to give to a son of Poseidon, and Sumarbrander must be unearthed by a son of Frey).

    While not outright stated, Magnus is most likely pansexual or bisexual, as shown in his relationship with genderfluid partner Alex Fierro.

    Loki mentions that the sword

     The Sword of Summer,

    Gunilla mentions that the kings of Sweden were descendants of Frey. Assuming that at least one of his noble ancestors was a descendant from Frey's line of the family, Magnus could be both a demigod son and legacy of Frey.

    Magnus falls in three very rare categories as he is naturally blonde, left handed and is the only einherji in Vallhala to be the son of a Vanir God.

    Due to Alex identifying as male when they kissed, their second kiss is the first same-gender kiss shown in any of Rick Riordan’s works.

    Magnus died on a Monday, since his first
    Battle Practice
    was Tuesday's free for all combat. This is, however, contradicted by the fact that he died on his birthday. In January 2011, the 13th fell on a Thursday.
