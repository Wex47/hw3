   New Rome University
   library. Claudia finds the book she needed as it literally fell into her hands and she sees a dark haired woman in the corner of her eye. She learns he was ordered by King Numa, the successor of
   Romulus
   , to create eleven identical copies of an ancile, a cello-shaped shield, given to him by the gods for strengthening Rome so that an enemy will not be able to tell the real from the fakes. She learns the real ancile will protect Rome as long as it is in Roman possession. She remembers the eleven shields on the ceiling of the Temple of Mars and wonders where the real one is. She puts it off for the following day and gets exited for the gladiator fights that night. She enjoyed the gladiator fights up until the arena was flooded and Reyna ended the match. But she missed it due to having to head to the bathroom to wash blood off her face.

She then writes her findings in her journal so the praetors know she is helping and narrows the girl's parentage to two goddess, Cloacina, the sewer goddess and Mefitis, the goddess of noxious vapors from the earth. Knowing the former has two kids at camp and they do not smell like rotten eggs, she focuses on the latter.

   After thinking about it, Claudia thinks the woman at the dump is behind it and realizes Elon is helping her.

She releases him and he explains Elon lured him away from the forges and trapped him in a bottle and demanded he reveal the real ancile. He refuses and the faun takes them one by one unit he found the real one. As the ghost returns to the forge, she thin of a plan to get the acile back.

   Mimi

   Aquila
   out for a reconnaissance flight over the scrap yard when Reyna reveals herself. She tells Reyna she wants to speak with her and Frank in the praetoria. Reyna confines the probatio to her quarters until she can find Frank. She tells the praetors everything she knew and Frank asks her if others are involved, when she says nothing Reyna calls Janice and Blaise in and Frank says they came to him when they learned she was confined to her bunk. Reyna complements her loyalty and requests to make a change to her plan, to have Frank fly her to the dump rather then Aquila, Claudia agrees.

   Things go badly as the bag load with their supplies was only filled with Hannibal's droppings and Frank crashed and broke his wing-arm. Claudia, Janice, and Blaise are then forced to lug their equipment to the dump and gar guided by Elon, who feels guilty for dooming New Rome. They reach the dump and set up a trap outside Mimi's trailer. She hides on the roof as the others hide in the Janus can. As the son of Vulcan throws a rock at the door, Mimi emerges and gets entangled in their trap. The legacy of Mercury searches the trailer and finds the ancile hidden under a sheet. As she emerges, Frank and two eagles come and take them back to camp.
