   However, Rhea was the most beautiful Titaness of all, which quickly earned her the attention of Kronos himself. Since the Titan King feared their father's curse that he would be overpowered by one of his own children, Kronos had initially vowed to not get married. However, after all eleven of his elder brothers and sisters got married and formed families, they no longer visited him. Despite he enjoy his authority and power, he got lonely and depressed. When his siblings claimed to be too busy, Kronos knew that the actual reason was their secret fear of his power and infamous temper. He seemed to believe that marrying Rhea would improve his personality and induce his siblings to fear him less. In the end, Kronos proposed to Rhea on Mount Othrys, to which she accepted.

   The newlyweds enjoyed a wonderful honeymoon together. A few weeks later, Rhea gave birth to their first child: a beautiful girl named Hestia. At first, Kronos seemed willing to be a good father and not to resemble Ouranos. However, the Titan King suddenly realized that Hestia wasn't a Titaness, but rather, a

   Trying to calm his wife, Kronos would give Rhea many gifts and invite her to magnificent dinners. She would give birth to two even more powerful, beautiful daughters (Demeter and Hera), and two strong, handsome sons (Hades and Poseidon), all of whom were gods, not Titans. As before, Kronos feared that any one of them might one day overpower him and swallowed all of them whole. Rhea pleaded with Kronos to spare their children but with no success, since even Kronos' love for Rhea wasn't enough to overpower his selfish and cruel nature.

   A distraught Rhea soon heard the voice of her sleeping mother, who advised her to give birth to her final child on the island of Crete and that he would save his other siblings.

Using a huge smooth boulder from Gaea, Rhea deceived Kronos by wrapping the boulder up in swaddling clothes and pretending that it was her final child. As his body was struggling with the young gods inside himself (all of them had been growing undigested in Kronos' stomach, being powerful immortals), Kronos swallowed the rock without even looking. Rhea would secretly visit Zeus on Crete and helped the nymphs to raise him. While he was growing, he suckled the milk of the magical goat

Kronos, who was very impressed by Zeus' excellent singing, dancing and joking skills, promptly hired him. Shortly thereafter, Zeus encouraged the Titans to participate in drinking contests. As the Titan King, Kronos would always win since he couldn't let his siblings or nephews overcome him in anything. Kronos eventually began trusting Zeus, which is exactly what the latter was waiting for.

Zeus prepared nectar mixed with sleeping potion to Kronos' guests, while he prepared an extremely powerful emetic for Kronos himself. Near the end of the Titanic banquet, Zeus encouraged all of the Titans to have another drinking contest and handed out the prepared goblets. As before, Kronos won the contest, but Zeus' emetic was so powerful, that it forced him to instantly disgorge all of the contents of his stomach, in reverse order of swallowing: first the boulder, then Poseidon, followed by Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia.

Rhea also looked like a benevolent queen, having a mature but stately face, a kind smile, and flashing gold eyes like a feline predator's. Though she had an elder-hippie vibe, she was so attractive that Apollo assumed that they must be related, though he was unaware of her true identity at that time.

A macrame belt cinched her waist, and around her neck was a chain on which a brass peace symbol hung.

   As the Titaness of Motherhood, Rhea naturally adored babies and was shown to love all of her own children dearly, even Hades. Her love for her children was what made her actually lose her temper for the first time, for witnessing Kronos brutally swallow them was too much for even her calm and gentle disposition to tolerate. Ultimately, Rhea's fierce, protective love for her children was what led her to secretly plot against Kronos, which in turn led to his eventual downfall in the hands of their six children.

During his and Rhea's conversation, Apollo observed that she had a tendency to confuse her own memories and to get carried away from the main point.

Despite going into seclusion to evade bad memories, Rhea still loved her family enough to intervene in their times of need: she gave her grandson Apollo good advice and sincere encouragement.
