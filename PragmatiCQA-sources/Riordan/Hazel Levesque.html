   On December 17, 1928, Hazel was born to
   Marie Levesque
   and the god
   <a href="Pluto.html" key="594e18d5-ed4e-477a-9a3a-97e632f6eeef" title="Pluto">
    Pluto
   </a>
   in
   New Orleans
   ,
   Louisiana
   . Marie had summoned Pluto using a spell that

    Hecate
   </a>
   had found, and they fell in love. Pluto loved Marie, telling her she was brave and beautiful. After Hazel was born, Pluto was proud and swore on the

   </a>
   that he would give her anything. When Pluto granted Marie one wish, Marie wished for all the riches of the earth from Pluto, despite his warning that the greediest wishes cause the greatest sorrows. But Marie insisted, which gave Hazel the curse. She did this mainly because she was tired of being poor as described in

    <a href="The Son of Neptune.html" key="b2d34c6f-7e30-48ba-9d7e-a0354d1e51a9" title="The Son of Neptune">

    </a>
   </i>
   . Her mother's ambition to become wealthy later caused her grief, as Marie began to use Hazel's unique powers (a result of her wish) for selfish reasons.
  </p>
  <p key="3a7a1cb2-ff33-4508-8c8e-b2c816a9bb48">
   Marie sold Hazel's first precious stone when she was seven, before either of them knew about her curse. Hazel remembered eating a picnic breakfast with her fondly on a morning during Mardi Gras. Marie was in a good mood: buying beignets and a bottle of champagne, even a new box of crayons for her. Hazel cheerfully drew pictures while Marie hummed. They watched the sky turn to red gold. Hazel remembers this as the happiest day of her life.
  </p>
  <p key="82543fec-9db7-43e8-93c8-e37666ec54a8">
   Gold popped up around Hazel’s house, as the curse only started in small quantities, and Hazel also would find them while walking up and down the street. Marie used the jewels Hazel would find as charms to sell. People would buy them and sell them for a lot of money, which brought Marie a lot of money. She became known as "Queen Marie". Marie and Hazel loved comfortably, with Marie being able to pay her bills, have steak dinner once a week, and Hazel even got a new dress. But stories started spreading, as bad things happened to people who bought the treasure. Charlie Gasceaux, who bought a bracelet, lost his arm while wearing a bracelet. Mr. Henry had a heart attack and dropped dead with a ruby he bought from Queen Marie.
  </p>
  <p key="0162d21a-7226-4622-b3b8-ba7ae263847f">
   Rumors began spreading about Hazel, who found the crystals. So only people who didn't live in New Orleans were the ones who bought the jewels. Marie began to resent Hazel, and became short tempered. She became wanted for murder, and her clients wanted to hang her as a witch.
  </p>
  <p key="f4358b6b-06a4-4349-8af0-ef3d37ed2d6d">
   Marie told Hazel that she only pretended to believe in Magic and it was all "bunk and hokum", and she was just performing. But Hazel knew it wasn't true, and she just didn't want Hazel to blame her for her curse. Marie would blame her father, telling her it was Pluto's fault. Hazel would never ask her what she meant, because it just made her angrier. As she became angrier, she listened to Gaea's voice and let it possess her.
  </p>
  <p key="6f15dc6d-5463-44b3-bc86-db53c8e5c4be">
   Hazel and Marie lived in an old apartment in the French quarter above a jazz club. By the time she was thirteen, it had become festive despite the war. New recruits would talk about fighting the Japanese, get tattoos, and propose on the sidewalks. She lived next to a bakery that would make the stairwells smell of melting butter, making beignets at night.
  </p>
  <p key="7bc78862-e4ce-4d1f-ab9a-98c6e1608714">
   Once, when Hazel was young, Marie took her to the dentist to get her tooth pulled. It was the only time she ever took ether. The dentist promised it would make her sleepy and relaxed, she was panicky and felt like she was floating out of her body. When the ether wore off, she was sick for three days.
  </p>
  <p key="957e9422-fd24-4da8-8675-3982a35ec0be">
   As a child, Hazel went to
   St. Agnes Academy for Colored Children and Indians
   . It was mostly black kids, with a sprinkle of Latino kids, with kids as young as kindergarden and as old as highschool. It was an awful school and Hazel hated it. She was bullied and tormented by the kids there because of her mother. They called Marie a witch and told Hazel she traded with the devil. She learned about Diocletian at the academy as well. She didn't understand why other black kids bullied her, but they took her lunch, threw rocks at her, threatened to hurt her, and pushed her into water fountains. Despite her abuse, she never gave them gold or diamonds.
  </p>
  <p key="0d4b181a-1273-47af-8b12-04bd8d70d01c">
   She was forced to attend a funeral for a classmate once, and she remembered how her dead body was terrifying.

   When Hazel was twelve, she went into the courtyard to eat lunch. She had her hair pinned back in a bun and she wore a black dress, unlike the other kids, so she stood out as looking like a mourner at a wedding. She stayed standing against the wall, trying not to be noticed.
  </p>
  <p key="1774e606-5d80-4738-b781-92ca2711a948">
   Unfortunately, one of Hazel's bullies, an older boy named Rufus and the largest boy on the playground, backed her into a corner and called her "Witch Girl". He forced Hazel to hand over her lunch, as it was an everyday occurrence at the time. A few other girls came over and joined in, telling Rufus not to eat it and it was probably poison. Rufus then asked if her witch mother made it, but Hazel insisted she wasn't a witch. Rufus gave Hazel her lunch back, but asked to give him a diamond. Hazel tried to defend herself, but Rufus and the bullies refused to back off. A diamond appeared between Hazel's feet, and almost grabbed it.
  </p>
  <p key="c0c3aa85-e087-4aa4-abfb-73fd0faac27d">
   Thankfully,
   Sammy Valdez
   , a troublemaker, walked over, and turned it all into a game, pretending they were filming a movie. The whole courtyard laughed about the possibility that Rufus could be Clark Gable as Sammy said, embarassing him. The bell rang, and Sammy pulled Hazel out of the way. Hazel took her lunch and told Sammy that Rufus would kill him, but Sammy remarked that Rufus knows better than to tangle with him. Sammy decided to keep the diamond as a token of Hazel's favor, but promised not to sell it. Hazel thanked Sammy for being there for him, and the two ran back into the schoolhouse. Hazel began to have a crush on him.

  <p key="06144a15-4796-47c0-a84e-81a347870fce">
   Sammy and Hazel were good friends, with Sammy sneaking her into the "Whites Only" riding club to take care of the horses and go riding. Horses liked Hazel, unlike any other animal. Sammy always made Hazel laugh.

  <p key="146e3781-2d72-481a-90ff-e9686a5f7f30">
   Her thirteenth birthday was filled with ups and downs, as the bullying at school was getting worse. But luckily for Hazel, Sammy snuck her into the riding club. They especially wanted to go in because rumors spread that it would close due to World War Two.
  </p>
  <p key="829215be-fd15-4783-adfb-1cca33cc94ac">
   That afternoon, Hazel rode a tan horse and rode so fast she left Sammy behind, leaving him winded by the time he caught up. He asked Hazel if he was "that ugly", which got a laugh out of her. They had a picnic under a magnolia tree in the cold, with the horses tethered to a fence, and shared a cupcake. Though it got smashed on the ride, Hazel thought it was the sweetest thing she had ever seen. They talked about the war, and Sammy lamented about how he wished he was old enough to go. He asked if she would write him letters if he went to war, and Hazel said yes. Sammy then kissed her on the cheek. Hazel felt like she was floating, and barely remembered the ride back to the stables. She never saw him again.
  </p>
  <p key="a60be00f-0ede-423e-bf8b-555f24991588">
   When she returned to her house, she was terrified. She saw Marie in a trance, and a voice came out that wasn't hers. She had seen her in trances before, but never like this. She ran downstairs after she heard what they were saying: how they must move north, strike back at the gods, and that Hazel was a poisoned child.
  </p>
  <p key="ed9a82d5-150d-4093-b08a-1cf4ce7d8b8d">
   She ran into a man, who turned out to be Pluto, at the bottom of the stairs. He gripped her shoulders. Hazel was terrified, as he looked just like Adolf Hitler. He remarked how she grown, and a jewel appeared as Hazel trembled. Pluto picked it up, and Hazel protested, telling him it was cursed. But Pluto called it beautiful and apologized to hazel for her fate. She didn't understand, but it dawned on her that he was her father. She lashed out at him in anger, her eyes filling with tears. Pluto asked Hazel if her mother ever explained her curse, and though she was too angry to speak, Pluto knew. Pluto told her she was born too soon and that although he cannot see her future clearly, she will find her place, as a descendant of

  <p key="3fe6ad9a-34a6-4006-9b63-783dd744b162">
   Hazel just stood there, paralyzed. She wanted to run away with Sammy, kick Pluto, stomp her colored pencils, but she didn't. She crept up the stairs to see what he would do, and peeked through the door. She saw her throwing things around the parlor and screaming at him. He pleaded with her, begging to stay and explaining he kept her alive. But she called him out, and told him they were going north. He tried to tell her they would both die, but she refused to listen. Hazel wished that he would stay and argue, but he left in silence.

   Marie took a deep breath and ordered Hazel to come out from the door. She clutched the colored pencils to her chest, trembling. Marie studied her like she was really a poisoned child and ordered her go pack a bag: they were leaving. Hazel asked where they were going, and Marie said Alaska, where she would "make herself useful" and start a new life. Hazel tried to question her about Pluto, but she brushed her off.

  <p key="c7e08a4f-fc4d-4daf-8d4f-be6d8bcd3153">
   Hazel and Marie lived in Alaska for six months. They lived in a small house by the docks that shook every time the Anchorage train went by. The kitchen was a hot plate and an icebox, and a corner was closed off for Hazel: where she hung up drawings of New Orleans. She went to school, and didn't have any friends. Rumors spread around the community about how she was a witches child. If she went too close to the children, they would jeer and throw bottles at her. Though, she did ask one local about the island she and her mother went to. He looked at her like she was crazy and insisted there was no island.
  </p>
  <p key="2fa44b2e-6043-4501-a76d-6ceffcdde0bd">
   Marie worked as a servant on third avenue for railroad workers, naval soldiers, and fishermen. She came home every night with the smell of fish. At night, Marie would be possessed by the voice, giving her orders for her awful plan.

  <p key="5908ee3a-7c6c-4e5d-ae81-b6635ad94c77">
   Hazel and her mother were ordered to go to Ressurection Island four to five nights a week. They worn a path into a cavern that Hazel donned "Heart of the Earth". Hazel and her mother would go into that cavern, and Hazel would work herself to tears of exhaustion, begging

   Winter was the worst for Hazel, as the voice was there the longest. In the summer, Hazel stayed away from home as long as she could, climbing the hills and attracting ravens.

  <p key="b0968adc-e490-498e-9dcb-39474399c066">
   One day, she stayed out later than usual and saw a gorgeous tan stallion eating gold nuggets. It reminded her of the horse she had ridden with Sammy. Hazel tried to approach it, but it bolted. She spent the rest of the day chasing the horse and returned home at 10 PM after she heard the train.

   Hazel went home after chasing the horse, and saw that her corner of the room was trashed, her sketchpad ripped to shreds, and her colored pencils broken. She read the note Gaea left her, which told her to go to the island. Hazel sobbed in despair, but went to free her mother. She used the boat her mom had bought from a fisherman (who died the next day).

   When she was almost at the island, a raven approached her and said: "Tonight. The last night." She asked if it was from her father, but it just repeated itself and flew towards the island.

   She arrived at the cavern and saw Marie standing over the pit, possessed by Gaea. But after Hazel arrived, the voice relinquished control. Marie sobbed and apologized. Hazel knew she should be angry, but she couldn't, and put an arm around her mother. She was frail, dirty, and had grey hair. Marie explained that the voice freed her, and told her there was nothing she could do. Marie then told Hazel everything in tears: her curse, courting Pluto, finding Gaea. Hazel begged Marie to tell her how to stop her, but she was interrupted by Gaea. Gaea explained that she only brought Hazel because Marie needed incentive to finish the job: if she sacrificed herself, Hazel would live and Alcyoneus would rise. Gaea told her because of World War Two, the gods taking sides, it would be the perfect opportunity for Gaea to get revive her sons and destroy the world. Gaea would rule forever. All Marie needed to do was to step into the fissure, as a sacrifice was needed to awake her son.

  <p key="ee3c27bb-395e-4387-bc51-07198f990488">
   Marie urged Hazel to go, but she refused. She called on her father and summoned all the riches of the island. The cavern shook. Oil bubbled and erupted as Gaea urged her to stop, that both she and her mother would die. Hazel almost stopped and hesitated, knowing she would only live thirteen years. But Marie looked at her and her eyes shone with pride. The only warmth she had been given in years. She told Hazel that she was her gift, and kissed her on the forehead and held her close. That kiss gave Hazel the strength to continue.
  </p>
  <p key="a3cfdf38-b649-43d0-8217-9bc1e3ff93b1">
   She used the last of her strength to crack the cavern walls. The fissure exploded, jewels went flying, and the roof collapsed. Hazel died in Marie's arms as her lungs filled with oil. The island collapsed into the bay.

The third said she did it to protect her mother and that she was young. Upon Marie's mention, Hazel asked where she was. The judges explained that though Hazel died for a noble cause, but she acted too late, but her mother influenced her. They agreed that Hazel should have

Firstly, she thought of whom to be Percy, but Frank had also been a descendant and so Hazel was not sure who it might be.

Hazel reassures Apollo that they won't abuse that power and will only use it to improve the camp and honor the gods. Hazel pointedly tells Frank that they won't be using it for anything tacky or yachts and airplanes. Hazel becomes annoyed when Frank plays with his praetor's cloak, turning it into a sweater wrap.

   Hazel is of Louisiana Creole descent with shoulder-length curly cinnamon brown hair and gold eyes. She is marked with a glyph, the letters SPQR, and one stripe for one year of service that she received only a few weeks before Percy arrived. Frank and Leo consider her to be very pretty, while Percy says that Hazel's mother looks just like Hazel, saying Marie Levesque was "beautiful." Percy also describes Hazel as being "darker-skinned," and when Hazel is describing her mother later on she mentions that they had the "same dark complexion, brown as a roasted coffee bean."

  <p key="f50cacfd-753a-4517-aa80-bded6da3e997">
   Also, when patrolling Frank's grandmother's house, Frank talks about how Hazel wore this shirt and jacket, "that made her skin look as warm as cocoa." She is toned and fit and is the shortest of the seven demigods, though she is also the youngest, in stark contrast to Frank Zhang, the tallest of the seven and third oldest.

  <p key="1c7e6763-e7ab-4cca-ab10-02ebaee8356e">
   Hazel is bright and outgoing with a love for creativity and horseback riding, but a has dislike for boating and curses. Percy states that she was a great comfort to him and Frank, at times even saying that she seemed confident. Percy also describes her as being very mature for her age, although he felt a little uncomfortable when he started depending on her for comfort, but was glad she was there. Hazel tends to ignore others at times for her own preferences. For example, she carries a cavalry sword while not owning a horse to ride into battle on and she originally didn't want to like Frank because everyone at Camp Jupiter said they would end up together.

   She feels a massive amount of guilt over releasing Alcyoneus, and thinks it's her responsibility to bring him down. Hazel can also be easily embarrassed, such as through Frank's clumsiness and his attempts to comfort her. Hazel is extremely loyal to her friends and treats them as family, as shown through her friendship with Frank and Percy, as well as the rest of the Fifth Cohort and when she gave up

Frank was also worried that he never noticed her blackouts before and asked if it was for a medical reason, and held her hand, which surprised Hazel, but pleasantly. After Percy left to get food, Frank told Hazel that he realized she was born in a different time and was from the

Frank reassured Hazel that she was alive now, and intended to keep her that way. Hazel said she didn't deserve a friend like him, and Frank said she was a great friend and not the only one who had secrets. Before Frank could explain, Hazel was dragged away by

Hazel eventually told everything, except for Sammy, to Frank, Ella, and Percy, and Frank held her hand, saying that Hazel was brave and that he could never be as brave as Hazel.

Frank wanted to go comfort Hazel right away but Piper told Frank to wait a few minutes so she could cool off. Hazel also tried not to laugh when Frank couldn’t get the Chinese finger trap off of him. Hazel would also talk to Leo and tell him that his fire made Frank nervous. The strain in their relationship ended after Hazel and Frank went to Rome with Leo, and Frank and Leo's relationship mended.

When Apollo and her are eating lunch, she's distracted and mumbles to herself about liking a guy with a death wish. She then tells Apollo how by talking to Frank and being made to feel loved by him, he washed away her curse, which she sounded grateful for. Before Hazel goes on the quest with Apollo, she has a talk with Frank out of earshot. Lavinia says that they would be there for a while, because when those two start mother henning over each other, it could take awhile. Lavinia claims that if they could wrap each other in Styrofoam peanuts, they would. When everyone thinks that Frank died, Hazel is in another part of town, and doesn't know. When Apollo tells her after they kill a legion of zombies, she leans on Arion and cries, but has to quickly compose herself. She sends Arion to go find Frank's body and goes to fight Tarquin. After the battle. Hazel is scolding Lavinia about leaving her post when she sees Arion with a figure draped across his back. It's Frank. They rush him to the medics and it is shown that Frank is healthy. Hazel and Apollo are by his side when he wakes up. Hazel hugs him and cries. She proceeds to tell him how he scared her and gives him some nectar. She kisses him on the forehead and tells him he broke her heart. Fast-forward to the end. Hazel and Frank meet Apollo in a coffee shop before they have to rouse the legion. They leave hand in hand.

Percy liked her but could sense she had a deep sadness inside of her: mature for her age, nice and easygoing, but hiding a big secret. He didn't believe she would have anything to be guiltily about and thought she was nice. As for Hazel, she was in awe of him. When she first saw him, she thought he was a god in disguise, with an aura of power, and ordered Frank not to fire on him, since she thought it was the gods testing her.

But to his surprise, Hazel kissed him on the cheek and smiled with sisterly affection, saying of course she trusted him, they were family. The kiss made Percy feel warm down to his feet. Percy felt lucky to have Frank and Hazel watching over him, and thought of them as the bright spots in his scary life after his memory loss. Hazel and Frank were the only things making Percy feel not alone, and promised that he wouldn’t lose them. And when they made it to Alaska, Percy saved Hazel from Gaea and promised her that they would find Nico. The two later promised each other that they would make it back home, Percy would see Annabeth again, and Hazel make it back to Camp. Percy said that Hazel was too valuable to him and the camp and he wouldn't let anything happen to her. Percy reassured Hazel that there was more to her destiny than dying since that she was destined to fight Gaea with him, and her life was worth fighting for. Once they got back to Camp Jupiter, Percy was glad that Hazel was being treated well and as a savior of Rome, and knew that she deserved it. Percy knew Hazel wanted time alone with Frank and respected that, letting them walking around New Rome alone. The next day, Percy promised Hazel that he would find Nico as soon as they made it to Rome.

Percy was very protective of Hazel on the quest, and when she went off with Leo, Percy pulled Leo aside to tell him Hazel's story.

Hazel said that she hated the plan, but she would do it for him. Hazel ended up making. Fake mist version of the
