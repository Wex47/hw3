  <p key="25e95b90-1bb7-428c-95a7-eeccaeb56acd">
   When Zeus grew to adulthood, he transformed into a Titanic version of himself and successfully infiltrated Mount Othrys at his mother's advice. Rhea convinced Kronos to hire him as his royal cupbearer. With the help of his great singing, dancing and joking skills, Zeus was able to constantly entertain all of the Titans at Mount Othrys, even Kronos himself. Shortly thereafter, Zeus encouraged the Titans to participate in drinking contests. As the Titan King, Kronos would always win, since he couldn't let his siblings, nieces or nephews overcome him in anything. Finally, the Titan King began trusting Zeus completely, which is exactly what the latter was waiting for.

   One evening when Kronos was dining together with his brothers and nephews, Zeus prepared a special set of drinks for them all. Zeus prepared nectar mixed with the sleeping potion to Kronos' guests, while he prepared an extremely powerful emetic (made from nectar mixed with mustard) for Kronos himself. Near the end of the grand banquet, Zeus encouraged all of the Titans to have yet another drinking contest and handed out the prepared goblets. As before, Kronos won the contest, but Zeus' emetic was so powerful, that it forced him to instantly disgorge all of the contents of his stomach, in reverse order of swallowing: first the boulder, then Poseidon, followed by Hades, Hera, Demeter, and Hestia. They escaped before their Titan relatives could recover properly.

   In the aftermath of the battle, the Titans were all chained up by the Elder Cyclopes, after which the Hekatonkheires forced them to kneel before the gods. Zeus proceeded to take his father's sickle and slice him into a thousand pieces just as the Titan Lord had done to his own father, before casting him into Tartarus, along with his brothers Hyperion, Krios, Koios and Iapetus. Only Kronos' mighty former second-in-command, Atlas, received a different punishment, as he was forced to
   hold up the sky

   Kronos was the boldest and most ruthless of the siblings, even though he was the youngest. His siblings and children were afraid of his insufferably irascible temper. He horribly punishes those who failed him and rarely gives second chances in times of crisis.
Kronos is said to have inherited his mother's "cold and distant" smile, which would not waver while he watched demigods die or cities burn. While looking at him in the eye, it is impossible to tell whether he intends to tell a joke or to start a fight, making him completely unpredictable.

   Kronos has a cruel and insatiable lust for power and domination that surpassed that of any other Titan. As shown in

   , he was the youngest Titan of all, which is why both of his parents initially ignored him. As a result, he would always strive to prove himself as superior to his elder siblings in any possible way, which inspired him to murder his father. He relished being immortal and enjoyed speeding up the growth of mortals, sadistically watching them wither up and die before his eyes, something he never got bored of. Realizing that his children could potentially become too powerful for him to control, Kronos' cruelty and megalomania began to surface stronger than ever. He resulted to savagery towards his children, all of whom he brutally swallowed (except for Zeus), earning himself the infamous "King Cannibal" nickname. While Kronos was confident in his abilities to sway demigods to his side, he soon recognized which ones were too loyal or stubborn to change sides.

  <p key="458614eb-16d6-4317-8e81-97acd9d5d391">
   Earlier in his reign as Titan King, Kronos was shown to have a more honorable side - he went through with his promise of releasing his Hekatonkheire and Elder Cyclops brethren (though only initially) and fairly rewarded the four brothers who helped him with control over the four corners of the world. Though Kronos had initially relished all of the power and authority that he possessed, he would later become quite miserable about none of his Titan relatives ever visiting him and knew they secretly feared him. Kronos would finally fall deeply in love with Rhea, believing that marrying her would improve his personality. Before finding out that his daughter Hestia wasn't a Titan, Kronos seemed willing to be a good father and not to resemble his own cruel father Ouranos. After swallowing 5 of his children, Kronos began looking "tired and apathetic".

    : As the most powerful of the Titans, Kronos possess a tremendous amount of superhuman strength that surpasses all other Titans, even Atlas's own. Even when weakened due to being inside Luke's body, Kronos was still strong enough that Percy, a demigod son of Poseidon with strength surpassing most demigods, was no match for him, barely able to deflect Kronos' sickle strike with Riptide. Even when the Curse of Achilles dramatically increased Percy's strength, Kronos was still stronger than him, overpowering Percy when they pitted their weapons against each other. The Styx would have augmented this power while in Luke's body as well.

    : Kronos was extremely intelligent, calculative, cunning and meticulous - an excellent planner. He created and enforces an incredibly elaborate plan which benefited him in some way regardless of the outcome, preying on the personalities, powers and, in his perspective, weaknesses of his opponents. Kronos got his nickname "The Crooked One" from his siblings for his cunning and dirty fighting tactics during their childhood wrestling matches. He planned the murder of his powerful father through tactical teamwork and distractions. After eating his children and having to constantly struggle with them trying to escape, his clarity of mind decreased which resulted in quickly hiring Zeus as his royal cup bearer, though Zeus's appearance still seemed vaguely familiar to him. After recovering mentally but being exiled in Tartarus, Kronos ordered to steal the Master Bolt and the Helm of Darkness to start a civil war amongst the Big Three. In

    : Kronos is a master of manipulation, rarely doing things himself and getting others to do them for him. Initially, Kronos was able to persuade almost all of his brothers to follow his lead in the murder of their father (with the exception of his sisters and Oceanus, though he later helped in the Second Titan War) in spite of Kronos being the youngest of them all. His reign is repeatedly referred to in Greek and Roman mythology as one of the best times in all of history for humanity, but was mere propaganda as mortals were treated badly. Even in his weakest state, from the depths of

     ​​​​Prowess in Battle
    </b>
    : As the leader of the Titans, Kronos is an exceptionally skilled and experienced combatant, even more so than his older brothers and even Atlas. In The Last Olympian, even with his physical power capacity weakened greatly due to being limited, Kronos still proved to be an immensely formidable opponent. Displaying vast skill in the use of his sickle, using a nuanced fighting style that relied on it's quirks, he was able to effortlessly defeat Percy Jackson, the best demigod swordsman in Camp Half-Blood, even mocking him and calling his skills pitiful, and slightly dominating him after he had bathed in the Styx in their second brief fight. Kronos also was shown to be an extremely skilled swordsman, as when Percy challenged him to a sword duel, saying Kronos didn't have Luke's skill, Kronos fought his sickle's sword form, Backbiter with complete confidence in his abilities and displayed sufficient skill to overwhelm and eventually disarm Percy with the Curse of Achilles who described fighting him as “fighting a hundred swordsmen.” Kronos then soon afterward nearly killed Annabeth Chase wielding her dagger and was ultimately only defeated when Luke regained control. However, because Kronos was inhabiting Luke Castellan's body, it is unknown how much skill was Kronos's and how much was Luke's. It is also important to note that all of Luke's physical abilities has also been amplified by the River Styx, so this would have extended the gap between Kronos and all others he faced even further. The Great Prophecy stated that if Percy made the wrong decision and Kronos regained his true form, Kronos would win.

The Titans were scared of their father, so they were reluctant to murder their father out of fear. However, Kronos wanted to show his bravery to his older siblings, showing that being the smallest didn't mean he couldn't do the job and being angry that both of his parents didn't pay much attention to him as he was the youngest.

In The Last Olympian, Kronos used Luke as a host to attempt to leads an offensive against Mount Olympus, which results in the bloodiest battle of the Second Titanomachy. However, when Kronos finally manages to disarm Percy, Luke is distracted by Annabeth, who reminds him of the promise he made her, which encourages Luke to finally realize that he was mislead by Kronos the entire time. Luke manages to regain control over his body and takes Annabeth's knife from Percy (the cursed blade of the Great Prophecy), and stabs himself in his Achilles heel (his armpit). As a result, Kronos was

He almost kills Percy with a poisoned knife, almost stabbing him in his "Achilles' heel," but Annabeth manages to get in the way and he stabs her instead therefore saving Percy. When Ethan confronted by Kronos about where exactly he was aiming when facing Percy in battle, he tries to imitate the attack. He simply claimed that he was not aiming for any place in particular and it was all a blur to him. During their last showdown, while Kronos is destroying the Olympian Throne Room and the gods' thrones, Percy pleads with Ethan that Kronos is evil and that destroying everything would not bring about balance, which Ethan is trying to achieve. Ethan rebels against Kronos at the last second, saving Percy's life. Ethan strikes Kronos' neck, but the blade shatters instead, one piece ricocheting through his armor into his stomach. Kronos then causes him to die by making a fissure in Olympus. Ethan falls into empty air, thousands of feet above the ground.
