   , the son of Marcus Aurelius, the wise ruling emperor, and Faustina. When she was pregnant Commodus and his brother, she seemed to give birth to two serpents in a dream, although one of these were fiercer than the other. However, after she had born both Commodus and Antoninus, his brother, the latter, being four years old, perished and was entombed, whom the interpreters of the stars promised would be equal in fortune as Commodus. After Antoninus' death, Marcus Aurelius then attempted to educate him with his own teachings and with the teachings of some of the most illustrious and excellent men in Rome.

  <p key="adabfa87-5336-4ba8-8dc8-ca39b1529137">
   But all these teachers of so many studies did not profit him at all, for right from the beginning of his boyhood, he was disgraceful, unmannerly, cruel, licentious, and also uncultivated and gross in speech. Already then he was a craftsman in certain crafts which were not befitting of his imperial rank, insofar that he would shape goblets, dance, sing, whistle, and perfectly imitate the manner of a fool or gladiator.

   In 172 AD, during the Marcomannic War, Commodus was given the victory title Germanicus. He ruled as junior co-emperor alongside his father from 177 AD until his father died of natural causes in 180 AD, and ruled on his own from 180 to 192 AD. Many say Commodus' reign marked the beginning of the end of the Western

   for a short while. During a military campaign with Marcus Aurelius, they were on a couch in the expensive campaign tent, Apollo kept throwing grapes in Commodus' mouth. Although Aurelius' reign was virtually at war, he just desired to have fun, not tromp around Danubian forests or stamp out barbarian tribes who weren't really threats. He admitted his father wouldn't listen to what he said and despised his new wife, Bruttia Crispina, whom Aurelius bade him marry. When a
   centurion
   came in to inform Commodus of his father's death, he decided to let him go and have his blessings.

  <p key="bff09cd3-4ca8-493d-93ca-2f8d07a7fea9">
   When Commodus became the sole emperor, he forsook the war which his father had almost finished, after agreeing to the enemy's terms. When he returned to Rome, he held a triumph in his honor. He then left all his decision-making to his advisors so that he could goof off. In public, he had a preference for gladiatorial battles, and he loved throwing extravagant games and slaughtering exotic animals and traitors (both real and imagined) at the
   Flavian Amphitheater
   . Commodus also liked to dress up in lion skin like

   At home, he would often play dice, keep large numbers of women like prostitutes herded together in a place like a brothel, and behave like the vendors that wandered about from forum to forum. He also was accustomed to manage a chariot in the habit of a charioteer, to live amongst gladiators, to drink from dusk until first light, squander the resources of the Roman empire, and, at night, to wander through the pubs and brothels of the city, even that it seemed as if he were born in squalor and disgrace, rather than into the royal rank which fortune had bestowed upon him.

   Thus, a hatred of him arose in the Senate, even that he lusted cruelly for the ruin of so great an order, and became ruthless because of it.

   Emperor Commodus was finally assassinated on the cold winter day of New Year's Eve in 192 AD by Apollo. He was disguised as his personal trainer, Narcissus. That day's game involved Commodus tossing severed heads of ostriches into the seats of the senators and killing an old man with his sword. They'd practiced fighting techniques like wrestling all afternoon and spent the rest of the day laughing and talking like the old days. But Commodus didn't know Narcissus was Apollo, the god wanted to turn him back into what he was before. The praetorian prefect, Laetus, and mistress, Marcia, demanded that "Narcissus" kill him since they had failed to poison him at lunch, and they themselves were at the top of the emperor's list of enemies, followed by several senators, noblemen, and some priests in the temple of Apollo Sosianus. Since Commodus was thinking about hiring "Narcissus" as an advisor, he decided to give him a bath. But then, Apollo strangled him underwater, whereupon the emperor mouthed his last words:
   <i key="f5da9e5e-f8ef-4aba-8db3-37388a65a51c">
    "You. Blessed. Me."
   </i>
   The empire was left in chaos as a result of his death and Apollo was very unhappy, but Commodus was reborn as a god.
   The city prefect, Pertinax, was proclaimed emperor the next day but his reign was short-lived, he was the first to fall victim to the Year of the Five Emperors.

He was going to rename it "Commodianapolis" as it rolled off the tongue, he was never afraid of naming cities or even countries after himself. Nero and Caligula thought the city was boring but Commodus planned to prove them wrong. First, he would make his announcement by saying a few words and thank them for coming. Then, he'd send a
