    Pitched as an MG American Gods, the book stars a seventh-grade boy who accidentally creates a hole into the Midpass, a world where ancient African gods clash with gods of African-American legend. He must race to find Anansi, the Weaver, and repair the rip before the iron monsters wreaking havoc in the Midpass consume their world and ours.

    Seventh grader Tristan Strong feels anything but strong ever since he failed to save his best friend when they were in a bus accident together. All he has left of Eddie is the journal his friend wrote stories in. Tristan is dreading the month he’s going to spend on his grandparents’ farm in Alabama, where he’s being sent to heal from the tragedy. But on his first night there, a sticky creature shows up in his bedroom and steals Eddie’s journal. Tristan chases after it–is that a doll?–and a tug-of-war ensues between them underneath a Bottle Tree. In a last attempt to wrestle the journal out of the creature’s hands, Tristan punches the tree, accidentally ripping open a chasm into the MidPass, a volatile place with a burning sea, haunted bone ships, and iron monsters that are hunting the inhabitants of this world. Tristan finds himself in the middle of a battle that has left black American gods John Henry and Brer Rabbit exhausted. In order to get back home, Tristan and these new allies will need to entice the god Anansi, the Weaver, to come out of hiding and seal the hole in the sky. But bartering with the trickster Anansi always comes at a price. Can Tristan save this world before he loses more of the things he loves?

   . Two weeks ago he lost his best friend, Eddie, in a bus accident and his mother gave him his journal. It was supposed to be for an oral presentation they were going to do but school ended early due to Eddie's death. The night before, he lost his first boxing match, his parents and paternal grandparents tried to cheer him up but were also disappointed, his
   father
   and
   grandfather
   were professional boxers. His
   mother
   came in and told him they're ready for him to go to their grandparents' farm in
   Alabama
   for a month. Tristan's grief counselor said it would good for him to get a change of scenery. He grabbed his duffel bag and Eddie's journal, it somehow glowed green but only he noticed it, and he never read it despite knowing that it contained fables he heard in his youth.

   Tristan noticed some dark clouds in the distance of the summer sky, he did not like the car ride at all. Grandad was always thinking about work and getting his grandson to do it, he was constantly talking the whole ride while
   Nana
   was knitting. They were always arguing and laughing, Nana was singing when not talking. Tristan noticed a weird symbol on Eddie's journal after his death, Nana revealed that it is a web, an old African symbol for creativity and wisdom, after saying that Mr. Richardson, his counselor says he needs to find out what he'd going to do in life. Tristan finally decided to open the journal.

   Tristan Strong woke up back in his grandparents' Cadillac, he wasn’t sure if that was if that was a dream. They were almost at the farm, Tristan spotted a stand of old and twisted trees. Nana explained they were bottle trees, slaves from Africa used them to capture and dispose

   . When the reach the farm, Granddad had Tristan help him fix a fence while Nana made dinner. While running up the extra wire to the barn after Granddad left, Tristan arrived at the bottle tree. But upon hearing Nana's voice, he ran back to the farmhouse.

She explained she's here for a sign, she threw goop on Tristan, stole the backpack with Eddie’s journal, and left out the window! Tristan just sank to the floor, but he saw a trail that Gum Baby left and followed it, ignoring fictional warnings.
   When he got to the Bottle Tree forest, Tristan found Gum Baby and the backpack near a tree. She got furious and attacked after he called her a doll, they fought until Tristan used the backpack to punch one of the bottles on the tree. A hole appeared at the bottle of the tree and created a column of fire, Tristan Strong and Gum Baby plummeted in to save Eddie's journal.

   bone ships
   appeared, but then a whistle blew and a flying raft lowered a rope to them where they are greeted by a girl and a dozen cloaked figures.

He tells Tristan that the god’s power comes from the stories told about them, and that the power is enhanced if an Anansesem tells it. He tells Tristan they have a plan, they head to the Warren, a hub Brer Rabbit uses to gather intel from across Alke, and are joined by Rose and Sarah. Brer Rabbit explains that the best way to solve their problems is to fix the hole in the sky and to ask Anansi to do it. The others shoot down the idea as he has not been seen in months but Brer Rabbit says they can do it if they have a

A minute later, Tristan realizes Anansi and Brer Rabbit were studying why iron monsters were attracted to the box and that after they were attacked the spider god hid it in the
   Ridge
   , a fortress city on the
   Isihlangu
   mountain range. They ready the raft and go over the Ridge's differences, which consist of gem encrusted towers that shoot lasers at intruders, and weak points. They plan to ride in the trash compartment of a train. They are attacked by the city's defense systems and just barely make it to the train. They land in the trash car, but it becomes nicer as they pass through a curtain. They wait a few minutes before flying off and go into a tunnel, then they enter the cavern where the Ridge is. They hear a

   They are apprehended and taken to trial, the Ridgefolk believe them to be behind the kidnapping of their citizens. They are brought before an elderly woman, the
   Amagqirha
   , who summons the spirit of an elderly man and other spirits. Tristan tells them other cities, and not just them, are being targeted by the iron monsters. Tristan requests he tell a story and the elders agree. He tells them of the attacks on the various cities of Alke by the iron monsters and how he is responsible and creates a monster during his story. Tristan asks for the Story Box to have Anansi fix the hole in the sky. The ancestors agree, but a sharp sound is soon heard, revealed to be the
   Abiyoyo
   , the monster he created during the story, that starts to attack the Ridgefolk. Everyone flees and Tristan and his team work to stop it. He summons shadows of children to distract the monster and has everyone shout its name to take it down. Once it is defeated,
   Fezile
   , one of the elders, agrees to aid the Midfolk and gives Tristan the story box. However, before he can reach it, a man appears and asks for it. He introduces himself as
   High John
   and states that
   MidPass
   has been overrun by iron monsters and asks for the Story Box again. Tristan asks how he knows this but he refuses answer and keep asking for the Story Box. As Tristan goes to leave, High John goes over to Tristan and grabs him before the boy passing out.

   Tristan wakes up on the back of

High John states he wants the story box to make himself stronger to to fight the iron monsters, but Tristan feels he is just being lazy and High John jumps off Old Familiar with Tristan in hand. They land in the
   Thicket
   , watching it burn as refugees flee the flames and
   John Henry
   tries to keep them calm. Tristan begs High John to help, but he says all he can do is have Old Familiar fan the flames a little. He sees a group of children cornered by a pair of fetter longs and he tells the story of High John and crafts a replica out of flames to attack the fetterlings and the children get away. High John tells Tristan to leave now or he will not return to his body. But he gives a message to John Henry before leaving. He sees his arm start to fade and he feels brutally cold before passing out.

Tristan asks the Amagqirha to keep the story box safe and she leaves with it. The guards tell Thandiwe the shield guard is almost ready and address her as princess. A giant hand breaks down the door and fetterlings start to swarm the Ridge. They hold them off until a large iron monster arrives. Chestnutt identifies it as a
   Hullbeast
   that unleashes a swarm of brand flies that paralyze the Ridgefolk as fetterlings drag them away. Ayanna theorizes that the iron monsters are attracted to Tristan and tell him to run. He agrees but a swarm of brand flies separates him and Gum Baby from Ayanna and Thandiwe. Soon High John arrives and he uses his ax to chop up the hullbeast and feed the rest of the iron monsters to Old Familiar as he and Tristan toss them at the giant bird. When the iron monsters are beaten they rush over to Thandiwe and Ayanna and
