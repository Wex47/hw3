   Jean-François Champollion
   , the man who deciphered the

Although Desjardins is proud of his family, he is also sensitive about being a newcomer to the House of Life. He lives in a house on Rue des Pyramides (Pyramids Road) with a large magical library; his door is red, which is said to be odd, since red is the color of

   and considers, for the first time, that maybe that they are right. He is said to have been shaken up by Set's actions and doesn't seem entirely sure of himself anymore, showing he doesn't act as rashly anymore. Despite appearing at first unpleasant, Desjardins has an honorable side to him, as he seems to have the House's best interests at heart. The actual reason he disapproved of following the
   Path of the Gods
   was that it brought about many bitter and backstabbing magic duels that cost the lives of many great magicians of the past, and he does not want those tensions to resurface again. He is noted to have become weary and somewhat apathetic, possibly due to the curses that Menshikov was using to drain his life force and weaken him. Also, while Desjardins did openly despise Carter Kane, when Menshikov brutally attempts to strangle and turn him into a serpent, Desjardins is horrified, and urges him to contain the boy in "more humane ways" and tries to get Carter to surrender rather than fight to the death. Carter is surprised to note that Desjardins actually seems a little sad that he's going to have to execute Carter when they meet each other again for the first time since the
   Battle of the Red Pyramid

He allowed Amos to seek healing at the First Nome despite their differences and even spoke with him at length about Carter and Sadie rather than dismissing Amos outright or condemning him. Carter is surprised when Desjardins appears to lack the intelligence that Amos describes when they meet again which is possibly a side effect of Menshikov's influence and draining of his life force. However, after being faced with all of the facts and how brutal Menshikov really is, Desjardins finally realizes that the Kanes are telling the truth and that they are right.

   , a spell capable of utterly destroying any being except gods, who are instead banished deep into the Duat. This is shown to be a skill that only the most powerful magicians use, as it is dangerous and requires a lot of power. Even in a weakened state he was able to cast an execration capable of banishing Apophis for a time, although it cost him his life. This is shown to be quite a feat, as even though Desjardins only faced a partial manifestation of Apophis, who had just risen from his prison, Carter and Sadie believed that even their combined power (and presumably the combined power of Horus and Isis) wouldn't be enough to banish a fully-risen Apophis with an execration. At one point,
   Julian
   tells Carter and Sadie that Apophis is impossible to execrate at all due to his massive power and points out how even trying cost Desjardins his life. The execration he cast only proved capable of banishing Apophis for days to weeks, but this was likely due to Apophis' incredible power and Desjardins' own weakened state at the time.

   : Michel's main rival was Julius. The first time Julius broke the regulations against summoning gods, Desjardins began to hate him. He couldn't understand how Julius had the nerve to break the rules of the House of Life, and this made him bitter. When Julius destroyed the Rosetta Stone, this increased the antagonistic feelings towards Julius, as Desjardins' family had links with the Rosetta Stone, and Michel felt embarrassed at what seemed to be a blatant act against his family's honor.

   : Amos and Desjardins seemed to have a complicated relationship. Desjardins did not really like Amos due to the actions of the Kane family and was willing to agree to an attack on Amos's home by villainous magicians, but also seemed willing to shelter and listen to him at times. When Amos was physically and mentally weak from his possession by

   , Desjardins allowed him to come to the First Nome for healing despite what Amos's niece and nephew were doing. He let him go afterwards and told Menshikov that he respected the House's policy of helping anyone who came to them for help. According to Amos, he and Desjardins had many conversations about what happened with Set and the gods, and these discussions may have influenced Desjardins' choices. When he's about to die, he passes on his title of Chief Lector to Amos through Carter and Sadie.

Later, Desjardins continues to chase the the Kanes, even teaming up with Vladimir Menshikov to stop them, but takes on a less violent stance as he tries to convince Carter to surrender instead of being harmed by Menshikov and even seems reluctant and saddened that he might have to execute Carter.

In his last moments, he makes peace with them, telling them he never liked them much (indicating that perhaps he at least respected them on some level) but has realized they were right.
