The Titans were the eldest of the three races born to Gaea the Earth and Ouranos the Sky, before the Hekatonkheires (Cottus, Gyges, and Briares) and the Elder Cyclopes (Arges, Brontes, and Steropes). All were detested by their father, but he detested the younger children so much (mainly for their ugliness) that he imprisoned them in the terrifying abyss of Tartarus, which was itself deep within the Earth. Enraged, Gaea told her remaining twelve children (including Koios), the Titans, to take the mighty Scythe that she had forged, and avenge their brothers by overthrowing their arrogant and sadistic father. However, while Koios detested his father, he was ambivalent at the prospect of murdering him and so were most of his other brothers and sisters, and did not step up to take the Scythe.

   claimed his supremacy as the Titan King of Mount Othrys, and ushered in the "Golden Age", Koios was justly rewarded for his help with control over the North. Koios was one of Kronos' most loyal followers, held in great esteem by Kronos himself. Koios was also the only Elder Titan who was naturally clairvoyant, and could accurately predict the future. As a result, all of Koios' siblings, nephews and nieces would frequently approach him with questions about the future.

Unfortunately, since Koios lived far up north, and Phoebe lived near the Oracle of Delphi, they could not see each other very often.

As the Titan King of Mount Othrys, Kronos would always win, since he could not let his siblings or nephews overcome him in anything.

   One evening, when Koios was dining with his brothers and nephews, Zeus prepared nectar mixed with sleeping potion for Koios, and a powerful emetic for Kronos. As before, Zeus entertained them all with his great singing, dancing, and jokes. Near the end of the Titanic banquet, Zeus encouraged all of the Titans to have yet another drinking contest, and handed out the prepared goblets. As before, Kronos won the contest, but the emetic caused him to disgorge all his swallowed children, from the last devoured to the first devoured (the boulder Rhea replaced Zeus with as a desparate attempt to save him, Poseidon, Hades, Hera, Demeter and Hestia) while Koios was temporarily knocked out by the sleeping potion, and could not stop them from escaping.

Zeus proceeded to taunt his uncle Koios, prompting the latter to hang his head in shame. Zeus proceeded to hurl Koios into Tartarus, along with Hyperion, Iapetus, Krios, and Kronos' remains. The Titans would be imprisoned in the maximum-security zone of Tartarus, surrounded by huge bronze walls, and a lava moat, guarded by their Hekatonkheire brothers. Years later, Koios, briefly went crazy and tried to break out of Tartarus but was ultimately subdued by
