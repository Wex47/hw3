   Xb'alamkej and his brother,
   Jun'ajpu
   , were the second generation of hero twins. They were raised by their mother
   Ixkik'
   , who was a daughter of a lord of the underworld, and grandmother. They were really good ballplayers, and one day they played so loudly, the lords of the underworld got annoyed and asked them to come down to
   Xib'alb'a
   . They went and had to face a series of tests and trials, they were clever enough to pass each one. Eventually they avenged their father, Jun Jun'ajpu', and uncle, the first generation of hero twins, whom the lords of the underworld had killed.

   , but they just defeated some of his minions. Bird and Jordan did this to establish their fame and notoriety, as well as ensure that no other godborns would ever challenge them. This inspired the humans to ignore the gods and instill enough fear in the gods to make them create the Sacred Oath, in which no gods can ever have children with humans again; that way they'd never have any competition. The twins used their popularity among humans as leverage in a deal with the gods where they promised to go on a PR tour encouraging humans to revere the gods again to restore balance, which was why these godborns got to live.

   They also took down an evil god named Seven Macaw, who wanted to be the supreme god but Brooks says that wasn't hard. This second generation of hero twins killed a wicked and arrogant giant named Sipakna as well by dropping a mountain on him.
Xb'alamkej changed his name to Jordan in order to fit in when he and Bird (Jun'ajpu') came to the US.

Jordan whispered to Bird that Hondo would be gone soon due to eating the meatballs poisonous to humans, so it would be fair for them. They wanted to pick the game, so they flip a rigged coin and win. When Zane found this out, Jordan grabbed him sniffed and found some hot chocolate, liqueur for the gods. Zane tried to say it's poison but Jordan knew it wasn't and he was a godborn. So he drank without giving any to Bird, but admitted that it wasn't that good, then he grabbed the coin and left. Unknown to him, the hot chocolate was spiked with
