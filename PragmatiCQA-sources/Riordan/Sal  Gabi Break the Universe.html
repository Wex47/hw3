    How did a raw chicken get inside Yasmany's locker? When Sal Vidon meets Gabi Real for the first time, it isn't under the best of circumstances. Sal is in the principal's office for the third time in three days, and it's still the first week of school. Gabi, student council president and editor of the school paper, is there to support her friend Yasmany, who just picked a fight with Sal. She is determined to prove that somehow, Sal planted a raw chicken in Yasmany's locker, even though nobody saw him do it and the bloody poultry has since mysteriously disappeared. Sal prides himself on being an excellent magician, but for this sleight of hand, he relied on a talent no one would guess ... except maybe Gabi, whose sharp eyes never miss a trick. When Gabi learns that he's capable of conjuring things much bigger than a chicken--including his dead mother--and she takes it all in stride, Sal knows that she is someone he can work with. There's only one slight problem: their manipulation of time and space could put the entire universe at risk. A sassy entropy sweeper, a documentary about wedgies, a principal who wears a Venetian bauta mask, and heaping platefuls of Cuban food are just some of the delights that await in his mind-blowing novel gift-wrapped in love and laughter.

   Sal and Gabi are sitting in the hospital cafeteria with Sal wearing the bauta mask and Gabi tries to get him to talk, even biting his leg. He eventually talks and they decide to work on an Everyman play. Sal calls his parents to ask them about spending the night at the hospital and to bring him some props. They allow it and send some time with him and Gabi before going up and meeting her family. Gabi and Sal take Nurse Sotolongo a coffee before going to see Iggy. They talk about how unfair it is for Iggy before Sal talks about his father‘s line of work. When he’s finished Gabi realizes that he could fix the universe and they leave.

The calamatron count goes from thirty-six to thirty-two before they stop him. As they head to the multipurpose room, where gym class is, they find mats arranged in a bed with a semi-deflated football with a teddy bear. Gabi starts to angrily text someone before Sal realizes it’s Yasmany.

He agrees to go with them to the hospital and they go to the multipurpose room to get Yasmany’s things. Sal stays behind and the sweeper gets no calamatrons on either the first or second floors. He goes to the others and as they clean up his things, Sal notices the wall switched back but he can still see both walls. Gabi sees it and Yasmany tries to sees it while Gabi fails to give him a wedgie. Yasmany picks Gabi up by a belt loop and carries her and his bag out of the room.

Nurse Sotolongo provides the opening narrative and Sal goes out as Death and “kills” her.

When the Vidóns arrive they learn that Iggy‘s immune system has shut down and he could go at any time now. Gabi sees him and gestures for Sal to come in. He does and Reina says that she knows Iggy will be fine in the afterlife, but Gabi can not accept this. She asks her mother to say goodbye to Iggy alone and she agrees. She asks Sal to stay and he does. She begs Sal to save Iggy by switching him with a healthy version of himself but he is against it saying that it would not be the Iggy she knows and that the dying baby in her arms is one of a kind. She agrees with this but Sal says it’s okay to at least look into another universe of a cure.

   As they search the multiverse, they see times where Iggy lives and dies, has different diseases, and an infant girl is in his place. With Gabi’s help, they find a universe where his mami is performing a prayer session with her family and the Reals. He sees another Gabi writing in a journal and another Sal acting annoyed and wishing he was anywhere else but there. Sal knocks his counterpart’s phone down and he sobs like a six year old in his mother’s lap. She asks if they are good or bad spirits. They say they are good but only his mother can hear them. When they explain that their Iggy has an immunodeficiency disease, Miami says that Iggy has neonatal meningitis caused by a staph infection. After Mami asks alternate Gustavo about his studies, she concludes that they need to concentrate so that the two Iggys can exchange the parts they need to recover.
