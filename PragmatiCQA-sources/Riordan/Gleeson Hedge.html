   Just then, a group of venti attack the bridge, forcing Coach Hedge to keep the students safe, ordering them back to the bus. When all the students escape the Grand Canyon Skywalk,
   Dylan
   closes the doors, leaving Piper, Leo, Jason, and Coach Hedge trapped on the skywalk. Hedge pushes Leo and Jason behind him because it is his job to defend them, as he reveals himself to be a protector. Dylan turns out to be a Venti and uses his power over wind to blow Leo off the side of the skywalk. Coach Hedge takes off his fake feet to reveal hooves, showing he is a satyr, and jumps down to save Leo while telling Jason to hold off Dylan which he manages to do for a while since he was a son of Jupiter, and invulnerable to lightning. Coach Hedge manages to climb down like a mountain goat and rescues Leo, pulling him back up and dumping him on the skywalk before getting back in the fight. When Piper falls off the edge later, Coach Hedge orders Jason to save her and takes on Dylan by himself, resulting in him being taken by Dylan into the sky.

When Hedge unfreezes, he wakes up everyone as he starts thrashing around, still believing he is fighting Dylan and the rest of the storm spirits. The trio calm him down and explain they are on a quest to save Hera and found him by accident, which disheartens him for a second. When Midas enters the room, Hedge instinctively goes in to attack. Leo, Piper, and Jason manage to hold him back and eventually calm him down, sending him outside in order to prevent him from attacking Midas and his son,

Hedge then helps Jason carry Piper and Leo from the room.

    Gleeson seems to be very protective of Piper, even more so than Leo or Jason. The two seem to gain respect for each other as they travel around. Before Piper knew he was a satyr, Gleeson seemed to push her even harder during gym class as a way to toughen her up as he knew she was a demigod and would one day need to fight for herself. Gleeson even goes out of his way to look after Piper's father while he was in the hospital, after being rescued. Even when Gleeson is not around, Piper can still hear him pushing her on in her mind or imagining things he might say.

    Gleeson is close to Jason, but quite not as much as to Piper. Jason is more frequently annoyed by Hedge's ideals about survival of the fittest and tends to send him away before he can cause trouble. However, Jason is sometimes impressed by how intelligent Hedge can be, agreeing to use his idea when facing the giant

    Gleeson seemed to have been annoyed with Leo at first, since Leo had messed with Hedge's megaphone. Hedge does save Leo when he falls over the canyon, since it is his job as the protector. The two seem to be closer in

     so he obeyed her orders, which was remarkable because he had a tendency to ignore everyone's orders. Coach Hedge was stubborn but was never crazy enough to defy Annabeth, even if he didn't want to do something. For example, when Annabeth ordered him to check if the fires were out, even though he already did it, he did it again anyway. However, he still felt a level of responsibility over Annabeth, even though she didn't take him seriously. He was furious when she spent the night in the stables with Percy, being so mad he knocked down a cup of apples with his bat, saying she was irresponsible and broke the rules. He believed that she would have more common sense than to do something so reckless. After the incident, he was insistent that Percy and Annabeth didn't go anywhere together, making sure that that while he goes with Percy and Frank for a task, the remaining crew watches Annabeth to make sure she stays out of trouble, even going as far as threatening to tie bells around their necks. However, by the end of the day, he forgot about the incident.

     bonds. It’s also partially because of Coach Hedge that Annabeth was freed, since he had ammo for ballistae. Coach Hedge felt immense guilt when Annabeth fell into Tartarus and paced around the death with tears in his eyes, pulling his goatee and slapping the side of his head, saying that he should've blown up more stuff in order to ensure her safety.
