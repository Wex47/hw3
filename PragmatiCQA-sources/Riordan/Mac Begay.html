   Mac went with his father to pick up his sister from her basketball game and he was riding shotgun, much to his sister’s dismay. Nizhoni told him about the monster and he became interested in a conversation, which changes when she sees his black eye, curtesy of Adrien. When they arrive at their house they see two armed bodyguards outside a black Cadillac and their father goes out to see
   Mr. Charles
   , his new boss. Nizhoni tells him that Mr. Charles was the monster at the basketball game and the siblings watch as their father shakes Mr. Charles’s hand. They reluctantly get out and his father notices his black eye. He tries to say his hands are full by holding his iPad close to his chest but his father takes it away and he is forced to shake hands with Mr. Charles and the two bodyguards. However nothing happens after he does so. The bodyguards distract him and his father while Mr. Charles tries to kill Nizhoni. He walks in to find Nizhoni attacking Mr. Charles and chuckles when his sister is grounded and he and his father go out to dinner with Mr. Charles and Mr. Rock. During the dinner Mr. Charles would complement Mac on his artwork and, in an attempt to learn more about the boy’s powers, asked Mac if he could swim.

Later that day Cuttlebush and his friends gang up on him at the baseball diamond, Nizhoni tries to protect him but she falls on her face. When Cuttlebush snaps one of his colored pencils, he snaps and has the sprinkler system attack his tormentors as they flee. Nizhoni helps him up and tells him Mr. Charles kidnapped their father and wants to use him for his business and kill her. She explains they have to catch a train to Gallup.

   Mr. Yazzie
   out of her backpack and tells the three, with Mac and Davery being able to understand him, that the Begays are descendants of Changing Woman and her sons the hero twins, Monsterslayer and Born of Water. He explains the holy people know of their
   quest
   and are helping them reach Canyon de Chelly faster. He then tells the children what
   Mr. Charles

As they climb down a large bird lands in front of them and Mr. Yazzie introduces her as
