However, an alternate Principal Torres picks up and says something in Spanish. Principal Torres angrily translates that she called them devils as she demands what happened to Gladis.

When they arrive, Brooks hears the birds warning them as Zane hears nothing. As Brooks notices the birds have no eyes, a storm appears over the island and separates the two. The wind dies down and they fall. Zane sees symbols on the walls before landing on a ledge, looking down he throws a fireball and sees dozens of viper boas, looking up he sees Brooks on another ledge. She tells him the birds were calling them a threat and her arm is sprained and there is no service, with the only way out is to climb down. Zane agrees and they start climbing. He drops his phone, but hears it buzz when they reach the bottom. After finding two tunnels, they go into the one on the left and start to hear a baby's cry. Suddenly it stops and they see a figure approaching them, another Zane Obispo.  As the son of Hurakan inspects his shadowy double, he throws fire and Fuego at it to no effect. It slashes Zane's arm as Brooks is able to disintegrate it with her shrieks, turning it into a pile of scales. Brooks reveals her arm is healed and they fly out and onto a beach on Isla Holbox.

   As he tells Brooks he believes that thing in the cave was not Mayan, the Queen of Xib'alb'a arrives and demands Zane show her. After she does, she says it is nothing of their concern, but they know she is withholding something from them. Ixtab agrees to tell them if they agree to keep this information to themselves under threat of half a year in the Underworld. They agree but she only tells them the gods fought monsters before time began and imprisoned them deep in the Earth, with the symbol meaning hope. She refuses to say more but agrees to have it looked into when he says a human saw it. Before leaving, she informs Brooks that Zane will be spending time with his father the following week. When the goddess leaves, Brooks asks Zane why he did not tell her about spending time with his dad. He says he just wanted to spend a normal week with her, and she agrees to it, but he wants to return to Pájaros to investigate as Ixtab never said it was not a demon and never barred them from returning. Brooks says she won't let him, but Zane convinces her by saying Ixtab could cover the whole thing up and she agrees to a flyover.

   When they do a flyover, everything seems normal, but Zane asks to get a closer look. Brooks reluctantly gets closer as they see normal birds this time and spot a demon digging something up. After it leaves, Zane lands to investigate and finds a stone box buried in the sand. He opens it to find a black shell with the symbol etched into it with gold strands on the bottom. He inspects the lid to see two demons have a party and a pair of familiar eyes. Brooks realizes the eyes are the same as what they faced in the cave as three demons appear. They sneak into the

   Gray Institute
   and be given a temporary license upon graduating. She protests but Jun and Seok say it is the only way for her to become an agent. Min reluctantly agrees and shapeshifts into a sixteen-year-old after Seok says she needs to hide her age, as well as not tell anyone she is a fox spirit. Seok tells Jun to hide as he would upset others. Before she leaves, Seok asks that she hand over the
   Dragon Pearl
   . Min is reluctantly but hands it over after Seok says it will be safe with him until she graduates.

   Upon arriving on
   Daeriseok
   , a gas giant with domed cities that houses the Gray Institute, Min eagerly gets out of her seat and is greeted by her instructor,
   Lee Bina
   . As Bina starts to show Min around, an alarm goes off indicating that the dome is breached. The two, along with another trainee named
   Hansoo
   , take action. Worried Jun might have inadvertently caused it, Min asks him to leave temporarily but he cannot as he is haunting her and would pass on if he is away for too long. After putting on vacuum suits and taking out a forcefield generator, Min suggests it is a problem with the meridian and the headmaster,
   Commandant Paik
   , asks for a progress report. Bina says it is under control for now and Paik asks to speak with the three. Once in her office, Piak asks for a status report. Bina gives the report and Piak reveals it was a test. After explaining how she takes drills a step further, she asks Min if she has any supernatural heritage, however Hansoo replays for her, and the Commandant dismisses the three. Hansoo shows Min to her quarters. When he leaves, Min tells Jun she thinks Piak is hiding something. Soon after Hansoo returns to gets her to introduce her to the rest of the trainees in their group,
   Duri
   , a non-binary dragon training to be a customs inspector,
   Chinsun
   , a female dokkaebi training to be a computer technician, and
   Haru
   , a girl training for combat. After that Hansoo says he wants to be an administrator as the group talk about their tests.

   Over the next few days, Min and her teammates are briefed on different protocols and safety guidelines. On the third day they are tasked with inspecting a downed shuttle and finding out what caused it to crash. As they do, Duri starts to feel feint and Min notices they are growing. She talks to Jun, but he quickly vanishes. Min panics and thinks there is some kind anti ghost enchantment on the school and notices Duri has grown more. Soon they revert to their true form with Min noticing the same thing happening to her and Chinsun. Min asks Jun what is happening, but he doesn't know and leaves just in case he is causing it. After her fox form is revealed, the others are shocked to learn what she is, but they need all the help they can get and pay her little attention. They hear animal sounds and human screams from the other shuttle bays as Min says her handler wanted her heritage to be a secret. The group leaves, with Duri's immense size forcing them to stay behind, and they find other supernaturals panicking after being forced into their true forms. A trainee from a different group notices Min but thinks she is a dog. Min asks Jun, who has undergone a change in appearance, and the others notice him as well. They panic but calm down slightly when Min says he is her brother. Eventually they realize they forced transformations and loss of control might have something to do with the artifacts keeping the institute in orbit and agree to inform the Commandant.

   They try to reach her but come up empty, Chinsun manages to hack into the system and get through. As they enter the elevator, Haru lays out a plan of action, having Min bite ankles if they are seen. They reach the Commandant's level and find everyone out cold and the door to the Commandant's office shut. Hansoo and Chinsun tend to the wounded as Min, Jun, and Haru approach the office cautiously. Just then the door flies off and a monsters will part from various supernatural species emerges, Min bites it as Haru shoots at it with blasters she took from downed technicians. After a while, Min realizes the creature is the Commandant and, hearing something in the vent, Min tells Haru to fire at it and Duri falls on the Commandant. The group goes into her office to find the artifacts going haywire and Duri manages to shut them down. After that the supernaturals could take human form and they realize she was stealing magic. But they all the thought it was a great initiation nonetheless and look forward to what happens in the future.

   Mississippi Civil Rights Museum
   . As they plot their next move, the counselor,
   Ms. James
   , mistakes Ayanna and Junior for campers as Gum Baby hides behind Junior. The teens go with Ms. James as she takes Ayanna's bat and has Junior check in his bag. When they enter the museum, they fail to notice a gray cloaked figure close by. As they get into the elevator, Gum Baby rips herself free from Junior's hair, causing him to yelp and Ms. James takes notice of her. Ayanna says she is a stress relief object, but Ms. James does not allow her to keep Gum Baby for the trip and drops Gum Baby, Ayanna's bat, and Junior's pouch into baggage check in. As Ms. James escorts her companions to the elevator, Gum Baby notices a figure made out of gray cloth get in with them.

   As Gum Baby struggles to get out of the bin, an old woman helps her out and introduce herself as
   Granny Z
   . As Granny Z explains how children are going missing and that she was stationed at the museum and cannot leave until her business is finished, Gum Baby mentions she saw something going after her friends. Granny Z promises to help her. Granny Z gives her a map and she sets out to find her friends. When she is in a hallway, struggling to read the map, she sees two people walking down as well talking about two new kids experiencing a power outage in the Evers exhibit. She heads into the security and, after seeing the monitors, realizes she has to be more careful. When she exits, Gum Baby comes face to face with a child. He is shocked but agrees not to mention her and she heads to the Evers exhibit. She arrives at the exhibit to find it empty and, after looking at a pillar with the exhibit's namesake, the lights go out. She takes a defensive stance and backs up into a button that triggers a video to play. After watching it, the ghost appears and floats over to a set of journals on display. After it touches one of the books while saying forget, it vanishes and Gum baby attacks it to stop it from touching another journal. The ghost vanishes as soon as the lights come back on and a security guard finds the exhibit covered in sap.

   Gum Baby hides in a locker before he sees her and watches as he is joined by the museum director and a custodian. The director,
   Ms. Fields
   , asks the two what happened to the Hamer exhibit, confusing Gum Baby. They assume a kid did it as the custodian,
   Mr. Clyde
   , says it will take a week to clean. Ms. Fields leaves as she has Mr. Clyde and the security guard,
   Larry
   , clean it up. Gum Baby look at the map to find the name of the exhibit changing as if Evers never existed. Gum Baby follows Ms. Fields. She hides in the shadows until the director goes through a door, watches as anything related to Medgar Evers, the exhibit's former namesake, either vanishes or is replaced with something about Fannie Lou Hamer. Ms. Field's returns to the exhibit, followed by the ghost. It touches her as the exhibit becomes empty with a sign saying it is under construction. Gum Baby watches in horror as Larry drags the "culprits", Ayanna and Junior, and shows the director a sap covered stone.

  <p key="13640aa8-e817-4e93-91ac-aca3d89d581a">
   Ms. Fields takes the teenagers to her office and Gum Baby watches as she scolds the two and says she is looming for their permission slips and will call their parents. She gets a call from Larry, who cannot find the permission slips, and Gum Baby enters to try and save them and that she found the ghost. However, they tell her to return to the lost and found before she gets them into more trouble. She returns to the Lost and Found and tells Granny Z no one has faith in her. Granny Z says sometimes one's purpose is not what they think it is and she just has to stick to it. Gum Baby gets an idea and goes to stop the ghost.

  <p key="b6ad8b97-9823-4678-89fc-53e5aaf4660a">
   Gum Baby runs across the hall, throwing sap at the security cameras. When she reaches the stairs, she creates a slingshot out of sap flings herself to the third floor. When she reached the exhibit on Ida B. Wells, she sees Ms. Fields and Larry walking to the exhibit with Ayanna and Junior in tow. The ghost appears, visible to everyone, and drapes itself over the curator and security guard. As it stretches towards the printing press to erase Ida B. Wells, Gum Baby makes a replica of Ever's journal and says the names of Evers, Hamer, and Wells. Junior and Ayanna join in and the ghost goes to grab Gum Baby, however its tendril gets stuck on her, and Gum Baby fires a ball of sap at it.

   In the lobby, Mr. Clyde wheels the sap covered ghost, believing it to be part of an exibit, as Ms. Fields demands answers from Junior and Ayanna after none of the counselors can verify if they are campers. Granny Z comes over with Ayanna's bat and Junior's bag and says they are with her, and their parents are coming soon. Ms. Fields accepts this and leaves. Granny Z says she will take them where they need to go and that someone wants to talk to them. Ayanna speaks into her staff and

   tells her to tone it down. She reluctantly does so.

  <p key="318c0ff1-1aff-4843-a38a-3d6efc705c67">
   Earlier that day, Nizhoni's father dropped her off somewhat late, earning her the annoyed glance of the other club members. She apologizes saying Davery's dad, who is driving them, is not present, but he enters soon after. After making sure they have lunch and spending money, they head out. As they drive away from the school, Nizhoni and Davery silently express their belief that no monsters will be at the powwow.
  </p>
  <p key="14c777dc-d3a4-4baa-b934-1ebbdc2e890b">
   When they arrive, they are amazed by the sheer size of the crowd. Mr. Descheny tells them to stay in groups as he saves seats in the main arena. They look at the sections outside the arena, food vendors, hip hop, and merchandise. Davery suggests they try fry bread tacos and Nizhoni seconds him, however Toni is reluctant, her father ingraining a healthy diet into her. However, Davery convinces her to try one. Nizhoni, Davery, and Maya order fry bread while Darcy and Kody head to the hip hop showing. Toni does not order anything goes off on her own when she is asked to get napkins. Nizhoni gets the napkins and takes a bite of fry bread when she returns, but it tastes rancid to her while the others say it tastes fine. She hears a drum and they head to the hip hop venue. The performers,
   MC ThunderKat
   and
   DJ KareBare
   , have a muffled argument before starting their performance. Maya goes to check out the flea market. While the others like it, the music sounds like nails on a chalkboard to Nizhoni as she complains about the drumming getting louder, but the others do not hear a drum. Nizhoni leaves to check out the flea market to find something for her mother. As she is looking, she sees a crowd gathering as an argument breaks out. She recognizes one voice as Maya and shoves through the crowd to see what is happening. Maya explains the vendor jacked up the price of a pair of earrings from five dollars to ten as she gave her the money and refuses to take the earrings back. Nizhoni promises to get their friends to help them pool money for her as they leave, the drum beat also gets louder. Nizhoni and Maya meet back up to find the others just as the hip hop show is canceled. They begrudgingly head inside as Nizhoni pulls Davery behind. She explains that she senses something is off and Davery realizes that everything makes sense. As they think of a monster that can do something like that, they both realize it is the drums. They spot six when they go into the arena and decide to tell the others about Nizhoni's abilities and find Toni.
  </p>
  <p key="ce9a5b0f-f880-463b-8c59-1e946fd4a364">
   They find Toni in the back of the stands and Nizhoni tells everyone about her abilities and responsibilities as a monsterslayer. The others think she is crazy, but Davery says she is telling the truth. Maya, Kody, and Darcy believe her and agree to help as she explains one of the six drums is causing everything to go wrong. However, Toni feels she is crazy and opts not to help. The five then put Nizhoni's plan into action. The five make their way to the stage and wait for the intertribal dancing to start so that they could get on stage. They dance with the crowd and each test five of the drums, all five sound normal leaving the one Toni was supposed to inspect as the culprit. As if on que, Toni dances by and tests the drum, resulting in the wrong sound to come out and it starts to transform into a humanoid deer monster. Toni runs away screaming and Nizhoni tries to hit with a drumstick to no avail. After Davery believes drumsticks do not work on it, Toni returns with a blanket and a large water bottle. She squirts it and the monster shrinks to a fraction of its original size as Nizhoni wraps it in a blanket.
  </p>
  <p key="d05e8aa5-7a98-4f98-b762-0d821f743d95">
   Mac interrupts the story, surprised no one got hurt, but Toni says his sister's dancing was dangerous enough. After Nizhoni guesses Toni got the water trick from her dad, the two laugh as Kody and Darcy mimic Toni's dance and she joins them. When Mac asks if Nizhoni brought him a souvenir, she shows him the defeated drum monster.

   mother
   walks by to say she is going to work. Pao hides Bruto under her covers and goes to her desk. Without opening her door, Pao says she is brushing up and eight grade science since she finished seventh grade the previous year during lunch. Her mom tells her not to leave as
   Señora Mata
   will know and heads to the bar. Pao uncovers Bruto, wishing he could talk, starts to see a cactus with red flowers by the banks of the deepest section of the
   Gila River
   . Pao is startled and breaks the connection. Realizing Bruto is showing her something, she asks him to continue. She sees other chupacabra puppies around the flowers. The images stop and Pao comes up with a plan. After changing in beige clothing, she scoops up Bruto and tries to sneak out, but Dante's abuela catches her and, not buying her excuse of walking Bruto, she tells Pao to go. Soon

   Pao fills Dante in as they walk to the river, unsure where exactly the flowers are. As they walk, Bruto stays quiet and his body temperature drops. Pao fears he might die, but Dante distracts her by talking about different antics Bruto got in. They find the flowers just as the sun is about to set and Pao goes to get one, but she trips on a rock. When she gets up she notices that the rocks are moving and they are soon dodging rocks. Dante activates his soul weapon and hands it to a surprised Pao as he  takes Bruto to safety. He smashes rock monsters until a howl comes out of the distance. Dante returns, tells her he hid Bruto in a hollow cactus. They watch as a pack of chupacabra puppies arrive and the rock monsters roll into the river. The puppies play as the middle schoolers decide how to get the flowers. She hands the soul weapon back to a worried Dante as she makes a mad dash for the flowers, the chupacabra puppies grows as she runs. She reaches the flowers and tries to pick one. However the ground shakes and the puppies flee. Pao starts to rise into the air as she realizes the flower is on the head of a giant monster. She loses her footing but not her grasp on the flower. Dante calls out in worry as the giant punches a nearby hill. Dante takes a battle stance as Pao takes out her knife and starts to cut the flower off the giant. A red liquid oozes out, disgusting Pao, but she keeps cutting until it is off. She falls to the ground, hurting herself, and goes to find Bruto. The flower rots quickly and she finds Bruto. She offers him the flower and he eats it, gaining energy as he eats. She is relieved that Bruto is alright and they rush to Dante to find him battling the monster and winning. She sees the puppies trying to force it into the river, but she realizes they will be crushed. Pao borrows the soul weapon and hits the giant’s left leg, knocking it into the water. When it falls in, the puppies devour the flowers. Pao and Dante meet back up and she wonders if Bruto would stay with his own kind or come back with them. Bruto comes back to them and they head back to the

   Rabisu
   , a one of Nergal's followers and a demon associated with discomfort and back pain. As Sik tells her he is immortal, Rabisu attacks. However he sidesteps and Rabisu hits three trash cans. Sik's mother comes out and scolds him for not showing compassion for Rabisu, referring to the demon as a Djinn, and takes her inside as she cries about not being able to kill anyone and has Sik clean up. As Sik protests, he questions how Rabisu was able to topple multiple trash cans at once. After finishing he returns to his apartment to find, to his horror, Rabisu wearing his best jeans and favorite Narvana T-shirt with a hole in the back. After asking what she wants, Rabisu explains how the other demons left for
   Kurnugi
   without her and how she was camped out at the Canal Street Subway station for weeks trying to open a gateway home. She asks Sik to help her and, at his mother’s silent urging, he reluctantly agrees. Sik calls

After explaining how modern heroes were inspired by myths around the world, he says that Gilgamesh was temporarily ruler of the land of the dead and anyone with his seal can pass through any realm he ruled over. Sik says he has the seal at home and Rabisu becomes overjoyed at the prospect that she could return home. Petar says to meet him at the
   United Nations
   building in an hour. They meet up in the visitors lobby and, in an attempt to get an elevator to themselves, they claim Rabisu is suffering from
   the sickness that infection New York the previous year
   . They succeed and Sik are Rabisu get in. Sik puts on the ring and pushes a button. Nothing happens and, after a series of prolonged sarcastic goodbyes, the doors close with Sik still inside. As the elevator descends, Sik tries desperately to get out. Soon it stops and the lights go out. They come back on and they hear countless heartbeats. Rabisu starts to panic, thinking they were banished for eternity. The doors start to open, and they see Petar in the United Nations lobby. After Petar says it did not work, they describe what they heard to him and Petar becomes unnerved. When Sik asks what “they” are, Rabisu says they are the
   Anunna
   . They head to a bench by the East River where Petar explains how the Anunna are beings who existed before the birth of the universe. After explaining the
   multiverse
   , Sik is surprised that it exists. Petar explains that the are safe as long as they do not meddle with the seven gates guarding the underworld. After telling Rabisu they can not take her home after all, she throws a tantrum and starts to cry when she learns Sik is immortal.

   After thanking Petar, Sik and Rabisu head to Mo's. As they walk, Rabisu explains the fun times she and the other demons had together, such as one planting maggots in her head, another biting off her tail, and one throwing her in a lake of molten metal that turned her into a skeleton for a decade until her flesh grew back. Sik says her friends are toxic, but she says toxic friends are better then none. When they reach the deli, Sik is horrified to find it so backed up. He gives Rabisu the keys to let herself into the apartment and rushes over to help his parents, telling his mom he could not help Rabisu as a customer demands his food. After the last customer leaves, Sik and his mother head upstairs while his father cleans up. His mother asks him to check on Rabisu. He goes to his door and knocks, but gets no response. He goes to his mother, telling her Rabisu is asking for the impossible, but says he has done the impossible before. Sik goes back to his room and enters to find the window open. He searches for Gilgamesh's ring but does not find it. He realizes that Rabisu is going to Canel Street to get home.

   Ski grabs Abubu and rushes to the ruined subway station as fast as he can. He hopes on a train on Spring Street and not long after the car stops and the power goes out. The riders remain calm for a few minutes before some start to get sick. Everyone starts to panic as Sik uses the shovel to break a window. Everyone gets out as Sik hears a noise and goes towards it. The father in he goes, the colder it gets. He bumps into something, upon inspection he realizes it is Rabisu covered in fresh brand marks. She tells Sik the Anunna were waiting in the space between words and attacks her when she opened a portal.

   Joon
   reveals his gifted mark to the ticket taker and walking back with a large pile of maps and tickets. As the other kids cheer, Riley laments to herself on the events to come, seeing the carnival as something tantalizing as she is a saram, someone without magic. While she gets to experience it once a year, she feels like the carnival is the only night of the year she can experience what the other kids experience on a daily basis. Once inside, Joon hands out the maps and tickets while giving them a lecture about what to do if they loose something or get sick. He heads to the tent to watch a show as Hattie drags Riley to the performance tent as well. After ordering one of everything from the snack bar, the girls make their way to ringside seats and watch as the Ring Master, a Gumiho witch, entertains the crowd with illusions. After Hattie eats some of the snacks, she tries to get Riley to eat them. Riley refuses as her sister backs off. Soon the Ring Master vanishes and a woman from the Miru clan,
   Strongwoman Cho
   , appears in her place lifting a piano that the Ring Master appears out off. Soon after a Samjogo seer,
   Old Man Nam
   , appears asking for a volunteer from the audience. He picks Riley, but she refuses and he picks another volunteer instead, a girl named
   Aracely
   . He predicts that it is her brother Mateo's birthday, she came with him and her mother, gave cake to her dog, and he predicts something distressing will happen to her before she leaves and pulls her aside. Hattie tells Riley she needs to use the bathroom and hands her the remaining snacks as he leaves. Riley watches the rest of the show, but as she leaves she realizes Hattie has not returned.

   Riley searches the port-a-potties to no success, but finds a trail of candy from Hattie's necklace and follows it to a tent. She enters and is amazed that it leads to a freezer sized room. Riley spots a building made of ice and looks into the window to find four life size figurines of children with a snowflake symbol on their forehead bound together by a red string. However she realizes they are real after seeing Aracely and panics, calling her sister’s name. She finds Hattie out cold, who explains she heard a scream after coming out of the bathroom and left a trail for Riley to follow and hit her head on a crate as she was running away when she wakes up. Hattie reveals that the
   Dalgyan Gwisin
   , the ghost of a vengeful mother who killed children after her child died and has been known to escape the realm of the dead, is behind it. Disturbed, Riley tells Hattie they need to save the kids and  go to find Joon.  They find Joon by the Ferris wheel, keeping an eye on
   Jennie Byun
   as she talks with some saram kids. They tell him the Dalgyal Gwisih is at the carnival abducting children, but he does not believe them and thinks it is a prank by a Gumiho. Hattie changes the subject and asks about a glass gavel with bronze bells with a snowflake insignia, an item that the Dalgyal Gwisin had with her. Joon says that before a soul can enter Heaven and apply to be reborn, the soul must be judged by all seven judges of the afterlife and, if found guilty of a crime, with serve time in that judge's hell and be branded with the insignia to ensure they do not escape. Before he can say more, he is forced to turn a pig back into a saram after Jennie gives them a potion. The Oh sisters look at each other, realizing they are on their own.

   They make their way to the staff tent and sneak in when the guard leaves. They find Strongwoman Cho and the Ring Master and try to convince them to help save the kids. The strongwoman thinks it is a prank and has the guard, who has just returned, escort them out. However Riley thinks the have Old Man Nam read them to show they are telling the truth. The Ring Master agrees to let them try, but says they will be banished forever if they are lying. They wake up Old Man Nam and explain everything to him. He reads them and reveals they are telling the truth. They agree to help the sisters as they lead them to the imprisoned kids. The Oh sisters lead the Ring Master, Strongwoman Cho, and Old Man Nam to the tent where the kids are. The Ring Master confirms that the ice gavel was used on the kids and that they are still alive, but just barely, and says they need the gavel to free them. Strongwoman Cho goes to cut the string, but Old Man Nam says it is a bulgeun-sil, a string that binds fate, and they realize Dalgyan Gwisin wants to take the children to the Spiritrealm with her. They know they must come face to face with the ghost to get the gavel and they need to get her to think she won. Riley comes up with a plan to use illusions.

   After creating the illusions, they take the kids away, however Dalgyan Gwisin comes back with two screaming kids, a boy and a girl, and they hide. The ghost takes the gavel out of her pocket and strikes the girl in the forehead. Riley screams when she sees Dalgyan Gwisih's featureless face, drawing the ghost's attention to her, and the boy escapes. Riley freezes in fear, only running when Hattie draws the ghost's attention to her and is frozen. Strongwoman Cho tosses a crate at the ghost as the Ring Master makes herself look like Riley to distract the ghost as Old Man Nam fails to lasso the ghost. Riley unknowingly runs towards the ice structure and is cornered. As Dalgyan Gwisih approaches, Riley remembers there is an incantation that returns things to where they belong. After the performances body slam the ghost the the group, Riley tells them the incantation. They reluctantly say it as Dalgyan Gwisin is sent back to the Hell of Infinite Ice. However the gavel is vanishing as well. Riley manages to free all the kids just before the gavel vanishes. The adults congratulate Riley, saying she has a bright future in magic. This gets to her as Hattie hugs her. They say their goodbyes to the performers and kids before meeting up with Joon and the others.
