They track her down to the train station and board a train. Sam and Magnus keep her from attacking the woman and they speak with her. She addresses Mallory by her full name and the events that lead to her death. The woman reveals herself as
   Frigg

Mallory jumps out of the window of a moving train and breaks her arm, which Magnus heals. She is still in shock that the queen of Asgard is her mother. Sam talks to her about Odin inspecting her at floor nineteen, as well as sending Alex and Magnus to the floor, and how she is the one who holds them all together. They set out to find the mead and they devise a plan of action. She comes up with a plan to help the thrall by sharpening their scythes with the whetstone. She tricks them into impaling each other and they move on. They pry open the doors using her knives and the assistance of Gunlod, the mead keeper's daughter and prisoner. She gives them the mead and her father and uncle return. They agree to let Magnus stay and fight on of the giants while she, getting sucked into a nutshell, is carried by Sam and they take the mead. Luckily, Baugi follows then while Suttung stays behind. She spends the fight in the nutshell and apologizes to T.J. for killing the slaves. They leave Flåm and reach Jotunheim by morning.

She is the first to receive a compliment, Magnus tells the Naglfar crew how she sacrificed her life to correct the mistake of setting that bomb and saved the lives of the schoolkids. Upon being reborn, she is the fiercest fighter and the best curser in Valhalla and holds floor nineteen together as a team. He reveals to the giants how she opened Suttung's doors with her knives, defeated the thralls using trickery, and didn't even attack Frigg when she told her she was her mother.
