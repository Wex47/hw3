   prized her hair above anything else and so he cast a spell on her to keep her from waking up and in an act of pure cruelty, he shored off every strand of her golden hair. Thor was enraged upon learning this and was about to annihilate Loki when the trickster god promised a new head of hair for his wife, even more beautiful than the original. In addition, to sweeten the deal, Loki also had Ivaldi forge three other masterpieces: Skidbladnir, a great ship that belongs to Frey and can be folded up and put into one’s pocket,
   Gungnir

   says he wrote Loki as he was in the myths: "[...] clever, funny, capricious, silver-tongued and quick to anger,".
   Loki is also extremely persuasive, to the point that he once successfully convinced
   Ran
   to lend him her magic net.
  </p>
  <p key="86c921b7-7519-48cc-bdde-7cf43297f685">
   At times, he almost appears to be a textbook psychopath with a lack of remorse and any form of empathy. Even his wife, Sigyn, who has been loyally at his side for centuries was at the mercy of his temper, and he wasted no time in calling her a "stupid woman" when she slipped and dripped poison on him. When Blitzen had been stabbed, Loki seemed to take great pleasure in it, even going so far as to make jokes at the dwarf's expense.
  </p>
  <p key="fbd0143e-4915-4063-8200-666d65fb71fd">
   Given that many of the pranks he pulls involve harming others and seems as crafty as he is crazy, he often comes across as a Norse version of the Joker from "the Batman" series. Many of his tricks border beyond cruelty, such as when he shore off the original hair of Sif.
  </p>
  <p key="1d72b1c3-8893-4b06-8438-987f27d8ab9d">
   Despite his negative traits, Loki does harbor affection for some of his children, especially Vali and Narvi. When speaking to Magnus on Naglfar, Loki is visibly upset and grieved about the shocking fate that his sons Vali and Narfi suffered as part of Loki's punishment for killing

  <p key="63e4a7a2-da29-4175-9198-cda4d7177f83">
   However, his affection for his kids may be an act. He didn't think twice about attempting to murder his other kids, Sam and Alex in
   <i key="5f33a6ce-6ade-4347-83ea-b1013f428dfe">

   and nor did he think twice about using force to manipulate them against their free will, going as far as to tease and jeer at them as well as even willing them to die. He was also plenty willing to treat his children as tools in his schemes, as exemplified by his using Sam as a bargaining chip to get the Skofnung sword.
  </p>
  <p key="3a173ed9-0ddf-43d6-ac90-245e252d692f">
   Loki has actively put a lot of effort into ruining his demigod children's lives. He even succeeded in doing so with Alex's life by ruining her home stability and turning her family against her. He attempted the same thing with Sam by trying to ruin her relationship with

  </p>
  <p key="5b6f9508-2b53-4e39-91f8-bbeffa5a3d96">
   On the other hand, this hostile behaviour towards his other children may actually be an act as well. Loki could be purposely making his own children hate him and keeping up the image that he views them as nothing, so that the gods do not go after them like they did with Vali and Narfi , thus sparing them the same gruesome fate.

    At some point in history, Loki was made the king of Giants, which is a possible reason for him having the power to control ice, fire and ground/earth. No one knows if being king is the reason for having these abilities or if he became king for having these abilities.

    Sigyn
    . It reveals that Loki calls

    's snake Beatrice, that Sigyn empties the cup for the venom every few hours, Loki doesn't think Heimdall can actually defeat him, and he'd rather stick to the family of the giants instead of the Aesir gods.

    It's possible that he could control serpents and other reptiles since he is their god, as Alex suspected that Loki was the one who sent her a lindworm. If that's true, it is also possible that Loki, as the god of snakes, serpents, dragons, lindworms and wyrms of fire (sometimes), can control them as well.

      However, even though Loki is the god of serpents and other reptiles, he is supposedly not immune to their venom as he would not be scarred by the venom's acidity during the time he was chained in his cave. Another possibility is that the venom of the snake above his head was created specifically to hurt him.

    It is possible that in his female form he has dazzling pale-amber eyes, as Alex's father is Mexican, and Mexicans are usually with dark hair and dark eyes. (And Alex's other eye is dark-brown, usually of Latin people and couldn't be from Loki because it isn't bright or dazzling).

    It is unknown how strong Loki is, as he never been demonstrated fighting, even in the myths, since he usually uses the mind and manipulation to win, (only in Ragnarök by using force), but is assumed that he is a very powerful god. However it is implied that he has some connection or control over the earth, or has immense strength, or even both.
