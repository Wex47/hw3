   The House of Life survived the fall of Egypt, but was forced underground. As a result, many of their most secret and powerful spells were lost. Since the end of the Egyptian dynastic period, members of the House of Life have been tasked with hunting the gods and trapping them, preventing them from having any contact with the mortal world. This is a stark contrast to previous actions by the House of Life, as they worked with the gods to better Egypt.

   Magicians are trained in Egypt, the First
   Nome
   , beginning at no later than ten years. There, they learn the basics of spellcasting. They are assigned to a new Nome at age thirteen. There are a few dangerous exceptions, such as Carter and Sadie Kane. While in training, a magician's specialty is determined. Initiates double as the First Nome's 'operators', scrying with bowls of oil and keeping in contact with magicians from other Nomes. Training is often intense and once the initiates are able to summon objects reasonably well, they will duel with another initiate while a full-fledged magician watches over them; this is done on the principle that magicians do not learn magic through

   A wand and staff is essential for a practicing magician. A
   wand
   , made of curved hippo ivory, is generally used for defense. The
   staff
   is most often used for offense; in modern times magicians have taken to using collapsible or disguised staffs. On occasion, the staff may be replaced by an object that is better suited to one's specialty. For example, a

   Magicians take a number of precautions to ensure the effectiveness of their spells. This includes wearing clothing made from plants (such as cotton) rather than animals as it may interfere with their magic; if a magician is strong enough, they are sometimes able to wear a small amount of animal products. Magicians may also tattoo a symbol of

   A spell, at its most basic, turns words into reality. A magician may use any language to cast a spell, but Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally preferred as they are the language of creation and Ma'at. The simplest way of casting a spell is to write it out on a piece of paper. Other ways to cast a spell include using a staff or wand to cast a glowing hieroglyph in the air. Or, as demonstrated by
   Alyssa
   , touching something to cast a spell on that particular target. Should a magician use a hieroglyph for something alive, however, they must be careful to leave it incomplete, else the hieroglyph itself may come alive.

   Magicians seem to have the ability to change into other creatures. This power seems to be standard for a magician as Carter and Sadie Kane were able to transform in to birds without any proper training. However is was most likely much harder, especially for Sadie, without hosting the gods.

  <p key="eca27749-4175-4b8e-84f1-7e2bd54bdaa1">
   To perform greater feats of magic, magicians have the power to bind themselves to a god using magic to channel their powers. Some can even draw the spirit of a god in to themselves. This is the origin of their magical powers. For example, Sadie Kane, while channeling the power of the magic goddess, Isis, was able to summon a concept, a feat that is supposed to be impossible.

   There are some limitations on the magic a magician can cast. Each magician has a limited reservoir of magic. When casting a spell, they draw upon this magic. If a magician overdraws their reservoir when they cast a spell, the lack of energy will be made up by their life force, killing them and often quite literally burning up. This limitation may be escaped in a few ways. Many magicians store reserves of magic in objects, such as a staff, amulet, scroll, or wand. They may also summon power directly from Ma'at for a spell, but this is only when using the

   This is the ability to summon a holographic shell around oneself and it increases strength and one's senses to a deadly extent. People with skill in swordplay usually follow this magic. It is not necessary to summon the full avatar, as followers of the Path of Horus have been shown to use the Fist of Horus, by summoning the fist of the avatar. If the power of a god is channeled to use combat magic, the battle avatar has a resistance to magic. It is seen that combat magic is also the practice of summoning weapons. The Paths of Horus, Bast, Sobek, and Set can be used to do combat magic. It has rarely been seen what normal combat magic is and not using a god's power to summon an avatar. A khopesh is best used in this specialty.
