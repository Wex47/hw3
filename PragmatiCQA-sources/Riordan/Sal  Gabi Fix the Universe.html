    Best-selling author Rick Riordan presents the sequel to the critically acclaimed Sal and Gabi Break the Universe, a brilliant sci-fi romp with Cuban influence. Among many other challenges, Sal and Gabi have to try to make everything right with our world when there is a rogue Gabi from another universe running loose. Sal Vidon doesn’t want to live a Mami-free life. Pulling different versions of his mother from other universes is how he copes with missing his own, who died years ago. But Sal’s father, a calamity physicist, is trying to shut down all the wormholes Sal creates, because Papi thinks they are eroding the very fabric of our world. All of Papi’s efforts are in vain, however, because a Gabi from another universe has gone rogue and is popping up all over the place, seeking revenge for the fact that her world has been destroyed. While Sal and Gabi work together to keep both Papi and Rogue Gabi under control, they also have to solve the mystery of Yasmany, who has gone missing from school. Could it have something to do with the wormhole in the back of his locker? Readers who enjoyed Sal and Gabi Break the Universe will relish being back in the world of Culeco Academy and the Coral Castle along with such unforgettable characters as American Stepmom, the Gabi-Dads, Principal Torres, and the sassy entropy sweeper. With multiple Sals and Gabis in charge, it’s no wonder this sequel offers even more hilarious weirdness and love than the first book.

   is awoken from a dream of his mother by his father to witness the first test of the
   Remembranation Machine
   to repair the holes Sal makes in the universe. He meets his
   father
   and
   step-mother
   in the living room as the tests start. The readings show they are successful and Sal feels as if he just lost his connection to his mother. Sal suffers a brief dizzy spell and ends up on the floor, where American Stepmom comforts him. He tests his sugar levels and everything thing appears normal. Lucy asks if something is wrong and, unsure if he is hiding something or not, Sal says he feels sealed off. Gustavo enters with a glass of water as Sal says this and theorizes Sal fainted because he is now sealed off for the
   multiverse
   . After learning he can’t see into other universes anymore, Sal is unsure what to feel. Just then Gustavo gets a video call from
   Bonita
   , who is running to the

   Ignacio Real
   in a backpack using a drone to hold on phone controlled by Gabi, says she will be there in fourteen minutes before hanging up. As the call ends, Sal jokes about taking in the peace before Gabi arrived. When Lucy jokingly tells him to be nice to his “girlfriend”, he jokingly replies back that she is. Lucy believes this is true and stammers as Sal proclaimed his asexuality a few weeks ago. However, Gustavo tells him Sal is joking and she playfully hits him. As his parents get changed, he steps outside and hears Gabi, but doesn’t see her. She then asks for his dimension and says she will meet him at school, confusing Sal.

   Soon after, Gabi comes into sight as Bonita is running towards him. Realizing Gabi is trying to make him flinch and record his reaction and that Bonita would never hurt him or the Reál children, he stands his ground as Bonita stops. Sal and Gabi say hello to each other as Gabi explains the device Iggy is in, a
   Security Sphere
   , is meant to keep babies safe on the road. As Sal thinks of how well Iggy is doing after switching out parts of him with an alternative version of the baby in another dimension, Gustavo and Lucy come out and greet the Reáls as Sal notices
   Meow-dad
   . Sal panics, remembering how Iggy is a portal between two dimensions, and takes the phone to frost the dome again. However he pushes the wrong button and activates the device's disco party mode. He begs Bonita to stop it, but she can’t as Gabi has her phone. Just then Gabi turns it off and everyone asks Sal why hid did that. He makes up an excuse about needing to go to school with Gabi and asks Bonita to take them, but she can’t have more than two passengers. Just then Sal's parents want to see Iggy and the dome defrosts to reveal only the baby. He falls asleep in Gustavo's arms and they head inside, one for Iggy to start screaming. However as soon as he starts, Iggy stops and appears normal again. Everyone wonders if it was actually something or if he was throwing a tantrum. They think of what to do as Gabi takes notes and Sal suggestions they take him to the hospital if he does it again, which he does and stops as soon as Gustavo is out the door. He gives the baby to Bonita, who tells Gabi to go to school as she leaves. Gabi states that she feels like she has pin and needles in addition to an emptiness. She looks at Sal who says they will discuss it later.

After realizing that it closes rips in the membrane between dimensions, she fears for Iggy as the connection between him and the other Iggy all that is keeping him alive. Sal vows he would help Gabi keep her brother safe as they walk to school. As they walk, Sal really has to go to the bathroom and Gabi distracts him by explaining how her drone,

Sal questions how a school janitor can get something like that, but it says various tech CEOs around the city owe Mr. Milagros for unclogging their toilets. He also reveals that it knows Sal has diabetes and says it will only record it with his permission and delete anything going forward. Sal gives it permission to deliver information to his parents and he leaves. He tells the janitors it was the best trip to the bathroom he even took about they hoist the boy on their shoulders to celebrate.

As he rushes to class, he runs into Gabi, but she is wearing a different shirt and her hair has a chip bag clip in it. He realizes this is a Gabi from another universe, the same one he spoke with before his Gabi arrived, and she says his universe is in danger. She reveals that her universe is in the process of getting destroyed due to the remembranation machine, saying that sealing membranes between universes is dangerous and her Sal is lost because of it. She tells him not to tell anyone about her and that she will see him later before leaving. As he rushes to class, he realizes the halls are empty and runs into

Yasmany turns around to see Sal and accuses him of listening in on him until he spits out the drone. Yasmany explains how his grandparents, who he is staying with, can’t take care of him and asked him to return to his mother. He says he has nowhere to go and Gabi says his friends and teachers will help him out. Yasmany asks Sal if he can spend the night at his house and he agrees. When they come out, Gabi and

   are waiting for them and the latter hugs Yasmany. Principal Torres invites the three to her office for lunch in her office. She gives them purple oatmeal, which she promised her partner Alexis that she would eat more often and made it purple to make it more pleasing to the eye. Sal eats it immediately while Yasmany, hesitant at first, eats but his and Gabi's bowls, who has not touched her bowl.

   Unbeknownst to Yasmany, Sal called his parents to let him stay over. They agree but he doesn’t tell Yasmany and he pretends to sneak him in. They head in through the garage and he half-lies about the machinery inside to toy with his friend.

Gustavo eats his sandwich as Sal and Yasmany ‘sneak’ upstairs only for Lucy to reveal she knows every and shows Yasmany to a room she prepared for him and a selection of healthy snacks. Yasmany is in disbelief that the Vodóns did all this for him as Lucy leaves the boys alone. After hours of video games, they fall asleep and Sal wakes up in the middle of the night. He sees over a dozen texts from Gabi informing him Iggy is home and the doctors found nothing wrong with him, not even the autoimmune efficiency he was born with, and asking if he and Yasmany need help. He replied what they did in emojis, which she hates, and goes to check on the remembramation machine. After making sure his parents are in their room, he heads to the machine to find it locked, but the monitor from earlier is on. He talks to it and they decide to ask each other question. After Sal gives it his best opinion on the meaning of the life, he asks if it is repairing the universe, which it is currently not. It asks why and he says it’s work could hurt some people.

After it calms down, Sal introduces it to the remembramation machine. After learning to Entropy-Sweeper tried to hack the remembramation machine, a brief argument breaks out with Sal talking the remembramation machine, who he names Brana, into tutoring the Entropy-sweeper just as his father finds the three talking. In the morning Sal is grounded for two weeks. As they walk to school, Sal expresses his distain for being grounded and Yasmany tells him how shocked he was at how calm and passive his parents were and how he wishes his mother grounded him rather then beat him. Sal realizes how lucky he is compared to Yasmany just as Gabi's drone finds them. They tell Gabi why Sal was grounded without tipping Yadmany off about his powers. Just then they arrive at school and, after telling Sal he should be more truthful, he finds Gabi and tells her the play was bad, hurting her and Aventura. He speaks to
   Vorágine

   As Sal and Aventura sit across the desk from Principal Torres, he apologizes for creating a panic as Aventura apologizes for dragging Sal by his ear. Sal explains he said what he said because the play was too by the book, which Aventura, who says she focused more on the costumes and just copied the script from the book to save time. Principal Torres says she knew the play was bad, but kept it the same as the parents, who are used to acting like their children's average activities were better then the professionals, would like it anyway. She forces Aventura to stay on as director when she says she will step down and forces Sal to become co-director. She gives notes for Aventura to give her next few teachers and leaves, but has Sal stay behind. She shows Sal her monitor screen, which shows a paper his father and Bonita wrote. She goes over a few incidents that occurred since he started Culeco. She talks about his escape from a locked ground floor bathroom to a locker on the third floor, the same one he pulled a chicken out of a few weeks before. She comes to the conclusion that he is using one of his father's devices to open holes in the multiverse for his tricks. She goes on to say that he has a big heart, basks him to come to school only with what he needs for his classes and to manage his diabetes, no magic props or high tech devices or he is expelled. She sends him him for a few hours to drop off any unnecessary props and says to be back by fifth period.

Soon the remembramation machine says that the other Gabi was right and that sealing off a universe can destroy it. They say they will not let his father know for fear of what Gustavo might do, but he decides they should all tell his father.
