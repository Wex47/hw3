    Do you get all these “heims“ mixed up? Well, this collection of rollicking short stories- each set in a different world and told by a different character from the Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard series- will help straighten you out. And even if it doesn’t, you’ll enjoy reading about how Alex saves Amir’s pants, Samirah plucks a giant’s harp, Mallory teaches a dragon how to throw down insults, and much more. Just watch out for Thor, who is running through the thing and raising quite a stink.

He decides to petrify him while Thor passes as any maiming would get Blitz more enemies. He had one of his
   Expand-o-Ducks
   and Hearth's tanning bed for when the elf visits, so he got the idea of making a smaller bed that will shoot a powerful concentrated beam of sunlight when opened. It took him forty-five minutes, Alviss was on a stalactite with a club bigger than he was. When he jumped, Blitz ran for it, Thor didn't notice them despite being in contact. Blitz petrifies Alviss, the latter throws himself off the cliff and into the water to cure him. Junior arrives with his friends, but the sun beam had to be recharged and the petrification wasn't as dramatic. Blitz put the mini bed on the ground and jumped off the cliff and into the river.
