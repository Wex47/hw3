   On February 15th, presumably 2004, Aru Shah was born to
   Krithika P. Shah
   and
   Suyodhana
   , who would eventually be the Sleeper, in an unnamed hospital in the
   Otherworld
   . When she was born, her father Suyodhana had decided to buy a gift for his daughter, which was the book

   Aru Shah was raised in the Museum of Ancient Indian Art and Culture in Atlanta, Georgia, and had lived there for as long as she could remember. Growing up, the museum never kept any secrets from her. She used to do her homework under the giant stone elephant at the entrance, whom she would later name Greg. Often, she used to fall asleep in the theater and wake up just before crackling self-guided tour announced that India became free from the British rule in 1947. Aru even regularly hid a stash of candy in the mouth of the four-hundred-year old sea dragon whom she had named Steve. Once when she was 10, while swinging from the trunk of Greg the elephant, Aru accidentally fell and cracked her arm.

   Even though she whole-heartedly loved the Museum and her mother, while growing up, Aru couldn't help but feel lonely. Because of the promise Krithika made to Suyodhana, her mother always traveled around the world in search of ancient artifacts, sites and treatises, trying to find something,
   <i key="a2966647-e7af-43b2-b4c8-48d0d604d3cb">

   , to help her husband
   <i key="94f63ae3-e4ef-4dbc-952d-66ef6040278c">
    and

   keep her daughter Aru safe. This led to the fact that Aru didn't exactly have a jolly time growing up.

  </p>
  <p key="7a7e7326-bbab-4b7c-b6b7-bf638370d7a6">
   Another factor that lead to her having a lonely childhood was because of the obvious absence of her father, who was, in fact, trapped in a lamp the whole time. Every year on Father's Day, Aru made a card for her absent father, but the card always ended up in the trash can because she had no one to give the card to.
  </p>
  <p key="c96446fb-1367-4b76-a201-180249258298">
   Another incident that happened was one time during a school dance at her school. Aru had been really excited to go to the dance, such that her mother gave her one of her real gold bangles. But on reaching her school, Aru realized that the dance would start with a Father-Daughter duo dance. In fear and anxiety because she didn't actually have a father, Aru pretended to sprain her ankle, and a teacher had to drive her home. Aru remembered crying all the way back home.

  <p key="8e409797-76aa-4f31-8cba-6bb1f90a6b2e">
   Unfortunately, that wasn't true. Unlike the other rich, and spoiled kids at that school, Aru didn't get driven from and to school in a 'sleek black car' and neither did she have a home 'offshore'. As to fit in with the other kids, Aru started her habit of making up things which often stretched truth to a far extent.

   After being called a liar by her classmates, Aru Shah lights the lamp of Bharata to convince them that she isn't. Lighting the lamp releases a monster known as the

She goes back to the lobby of the museum, where the stone statue of an elephant starts to move and 'speak', a voice booming from inside. The stone elephant's mouth opens, and

   flies out, revealing himself as the source of the noise. Boo asks where is the Pandava brother, since only one of Pandava brothers could light the lamp. And when Aru says it was her who lit the lamp, Boo stated they might as well let the world end. She then finds her soul sister and soul father and embarks on an extraordinary journey through Hindu Mythology.

When they were found she launched Vajra, which she was having trouble using, at them and chased a thief, another one of her Pandava sisters.

   Fourteen-year-old Aru Shah and her friends are sent on a mission to rescue two "targets," one of whom is about to utter a prophecy that could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Turns out the targets, a pair of twins, are the newest Pandava sisters, though the prophecy says that one sister is not true. When the Pandavas fail to prevent the prophecy from reaching the Sleeper's ears, the heavenly attendants ask them to step aside. Aru believes that the only way to put the shine back on their brand is to find the Kalpavriksha, the wish-granting tree that came out of the
   Ocean of Milk
   when it was churned. If she can reach it before the Sleeper, perhaps she can turn everything around with one wish. The plot of the book is that, after a botched rescue mission of

   Throughout the Books, it is said numerous times that Aru is a very imaginative person. At first, it shows that she is lying, but instead of using it in a bad way, she uses her imagination to her advantage, like using it for strategy, empathizing, and breaking through illusions and magic.

One of her teachers drives her home, &amp; Aru cries the way home. Growing up, Aru has often been neglected by her mother and has no father, so she hates it when the rich students in her school brag about how their parents are. She even gets angry when Mini asks if her mother really never showed her the

     Aru and Mini quickly became friends during their first quest together; although they have a few rough spots, like when Mini discovers Aru lit the lamp to impress a couple losers, but they apologize to each other soon after the fact, as they do for the rest of their arguments, and trust each other a lot.

     Aru and Brynne had an antagonistic start to their relationship, to say the least, due to a combination of circumstances, conflicting personalities, and jealousy. They truly become friends after Mini is captured, and they all share dreams with her where she tells them, among other things, to not blame each other, and after Aiden gives Aru a 100 Grand and a space to clear the air with Brynne. They commiserate about family and become closer; Brynne even shares the bar with Aru. So after that, they become pretty close friends, joking around together and teasing each other.

     Aiden and Aru had a rocky start to their relationship. Aru, having a crush on him, bumped into him one day, and in their first mutual interaction she word vomits on him and runs away. When they met again in Aru Shah and the Song of Death, he seems somewhat embarrassed when Brynne lets on he talked about that encounter with her in front of Aru. Throughout the Book they become friends. A few times, Aiden says that he obviously doesn’t feel romantic feelings for Aru, and Aru, embarrassed, agrees, and she seems to be over her crush at the end of the Book, although there’s still a possibility they could fall in love. A significant step in their relationship occurs when Aru notices Aiden sulking in his lawn during her birthday party and he brings her along on his mission to Parent Trap his parents; however, Aru helps show him that what he really cares about is whether his mom is happy and loves herself. There is also a part in Aru Shah and the Song of Death, where Aiden, Brynne, and Aru are discussing what happened previously, with their fight against Takshaka. Brynne and Aru were filling Aiden in, as Aiden had been knocked out. After Aru is done explaining what happened, Brynne says "A boy asked for Aru's number." To which Aiden responds saying, "Why?" Aiden's comment really hurt Aru, but she says sarcastically, "Wow, thanks." Aiden blushes and starts to say something, but Aru cuts him off.

     Several times in Aru Shah and the Tree of Wishes, he hints that he might have a crush on her, whether he recognizes it as such or not, like when he stares at her after she gets her new outfit from Nikita, when he implies that she's beautiful when she says Sohail the chakora bird viewed her as hideous, or when after using the key, he openly stares at her for a full second, implying that the key has unlocked a feeling within him.

     There is also a part of the beginning of the Book where Sheela tells the story of Princess Draupadi (who was reincarnated into Aiden) and the 5 Pandava brothers. She ends her story with; "The only sad thing was that she loved one brother more than the rest." After she finished her story, her eyes flashed silver, according to Aru, and then said, mostly to herself; "Even lifetimes later?" Aiden then responded and said, "What are you talking about?" Sheela could possibly be referring to Aru (reincarnated soul of Arjuna), but we will have to see in the coming Books. The reason why Sheela would be referring to Aru, and not Brynne, Mini, Nikita, or Sheela herself, is because Aiden only sees Brynne as his best friend, Mini as his sister, and the twins as his friends, leaving the only other person to be Aru. We don't really know how Aiden feels about Aru, but it is implied he has a crush on her.

    At Home Depot, Rudy tells Aru that she must hate the place, with Aru replying that she doesn't hate the place, as she and her mother had fun times there. Rudy invited Aru to his palace, in which she is originally excited about, as no boys have ever invited her anywhere. However, she saw Mini stop for a moment, then continue, and she immediately felt bad, as she knew Mini had a crush on Rudy. She politely turns Rudy down, and tries to catch up with the other girls. As she is leaving, she overhears Rudy tell Aiden that he thought Aru would hate Home Depot. Aru imagines Aiden fiddling with his camera when he says "Then I guess you don't really know her." In the City of Gold, Aru repeatedly gets annoyed and frustrated when Aiden shows affection towards Kara, the Sleeper's other daughter. Aiden also recieves a prophecy that tells him that "The girl you love will be the death of you." causing Aiden to give Aru the cold shoulder. Near the end, however, Aru overhears Kara confessing to Aiden and Aiden tells her that he only thinks of Kara of a friend. Later, Aiden kisses Aru on her birthday, causing Aru to start to ignore him out of confusion. "Aiden lifted Shadowfax, but not before glancing at Aru. She pretended she didn’t see him looking at her. They hadn’t really spoken to each other since the kiss, and now Aru wasn’t sure what to do. It’s not like she could casually ask, So…WHAT WAS THAT? Could she?"(City of Gold)

     Aru first saw Rudy in Aru Shah and the End of Time, when he winked at Mini causing her to walk into a pole. She officially met him in Aru Shah and the Song of Death, when he rescued her, Bynne and Aiden when his grandfather Takshaka was attacking them. She got flustered when he asked her for her number, and initially refused on principal, but gave it to him after some persuasian.

    Later in Aru Shah and the Tree of Wishes, he joins Aru and her crew on their unofficial quest to find the tree of wishes, Kalpavriksha. During the Book, they become friends with each other, despite Aru initially being annoyed at him. During the Book, it might suggest that Rudy has a crush on her, like when he asked her to come to his father's palace, or when he said that she wouldn't like the store they visit.
