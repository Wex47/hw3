   , they go to get the mail, but their aunt tells them to wait as they are still training. After completing the session, the two race to the mailbox as tigers. Sooni gets to the mailbox first and the two find a package along with two letters from the Space Force, one addressed to Sebin and the other addressed to the Juhwang Matriarch. Sensing something is wrong, Sooni tells her nibling to take the packages and the letter and to head to the matriarch. After arriving at the Matriarch's residence, a building on the side of the clan's estate, and give her the package. They find Hwan's sword in the parcel and read the letter, Sebin listens in disbelief as they learn Hwan has betrayed the Thousand Words and is missing, a warrant has been issued and they learn Hwan will be court marshaled if found. Feeling betrayed and angered that the clan's honor has been tainted, the Matriarch calls for a meeting of the clan council with Sebin being permitted to attend if they only speak when spoken to. After Sebin's parents and a few great aunts and great uncles arrive,the Matriarch informs them that Heaney has been branded a traitor by the Thousand Worlds. As the council members are outraged for their clan name to be tarnished, the Matriarch calls
   Juhwang Hasun
   , a rear admiral in the Space Forces, for clarification. Hasun answers and confirms Hwan has indeed been branded a traitor for going after the
   Dragon Pearl
   . When the admiral is berated for not doing enough, Sebin speaks up saying they should not interfere to much. Upon realizing Sebin is in the room, the admiral congratulates them. Sebin is confused about when the admiral mentions a letter, the Matriarch forces them to read it out loud. Sebin learns they have been accepted into the Space Forces and are given a time and place to report to basic training. Some of the clan find it suspicious of the timing of the acceptance, but Hasun reassures the clan it has nothing to do with Hwan. After sighing off, the Matriarch says Sabin will join the Space forces, but will report to the clan first and do anything to clear the family name.

   After bandaging their hand after the matriarch scratched it, Sebin is accompanied to the entrance of the estate by their mother and aunt, the others having family business to tend to. Sooni gives Sebin a small blade for luck as their transport arrives to take them to

   Ensign Hak

   After Sebin and Jee fill out more paperwork and get their military idies, they head to the Haetae. The cadets are impressed with the ship and board. The ensign letting people on takes notice of Sebin's family name, much to their horror, but Hak cuts her off before she can say anything. After boarding, a lieutenant takes Yi and Min to their quarters as Hak takes the cadets to

Sebin tries to tell Hak, but she does not believe them. They meet the captain and swear in, however while Jee's wearing in goes smoothly, Sebin's is interrupted by an explosion before it even starts and  the captain orders everyone to their battle stations. Sebin, Jee, and Hak go into the corridors and run into Euna and Namkyu just as the security barricades close. Hak tells the cadets to return to their bunk until further notice and to contact lieutenant Han-gyeol if they have questions. They reluctantly obey and return to the bunks. Soon after they elect Namkyu leader and Jee hacks the security cameras to find that the captain and auxiliary commander are. The group tries and fails to contact anyone and Jee says all cameras are offline and an intruder alert has been triggered. Euna grabs a blaster she smuggled with her as Sebin transforms into a tiger.

   The door opens to reveal Min, who is staying down the hall from them, holding a blaster to the cadets as Sebin reverts to human form. The cadets explain how they hacked into the security system and found no crew as well as failing to contact anyone. Min says she could not contact anyone as well and they set out to find someone. The group runs into Yi along the way, who confirms that it is sabotage and they pass unconscious crew members as they reach an elevator. Jee gets it operational and they head to the bridge. Before the doors open, Sebin tells Min and Euna to cover them. Sebin transforms into a tiger and sees a larger white tiger among the unconscious crew. They recognize it as their uncle
   Hwan
   and he tries to recruit Sebin to his side. However Sebin tries to reason with their uncle as Euna fires a flashgun. Hwan leaves and the others interrogate Sebin after realizing they know the tiger. They say he is their uncle Hwan as Namkyu confirms that the crew is all alive. Min blames it on her luck as Yi orders her to escort Sabin to the holding cells for interrogation.

   As Sebin contemplates on the events of the day, as well as their future in the Space Forces, they try and fail to escape from the holding cell. They notice a breeze and Hwan appears before them. Hwan tells his nibbling about how Min snuck onto the
   Pale Lightning
   and stole a Dragon Pearl before it could be used for the glory of the Juhwang clan. Sebin listens as Hwan tells them how he has taken control of the Haetae by using its own security system against the crew and how he plans to use Min to make them obey him. They accept their uncle's offer to join him as he frees the young tiger spirit. As Hwan leads Sebin to the cargo hold, he says he has an associate who can help him control Min. When the two arrive, Sebin notices barrels that have the scent of living beings in them.

Hwan finds Min and Yi on the fifth level on a live feed  and takes Sebin, Sena, and Shield with him. After tracking the two down, Hwan tells Sebin to wait for his signal. Shield goes out first followed by Hwan and Sena with Sebin going out last. Min shouts for Yi to run as she sees Sebin and declares she knew they were working for Hwan the whole time. Min fires a blaster at Hwan but Sebin blocks it and get hit in the forehead. Soon Sheild starts to drain the magic of both Min and Jun and the siblings revert to their true forms as Sena threatens to send Jun to the afterlife if Min does not work with them. Min reminds Hwan he was the one who sent her brother to his death before pleading with Sena to let Jun stay in the land of the living. Sena starts the cleansing ritual and talks softly to Jun as he agrees with her and starts to fade. Min continues to plead as Sena stops, revealing it to be a warning and and threatens to send Jun away if she disobeys. Min reluctantly agrees and requests she be allowed to return to human form. Hwan reluctantly allows her as Shield requests two treats to do so. Sena gives him the treats and he lets Min take human form. Min leads them to the medical bay, where the captain is being treated, as Sebin watches Min. The doors fail to open when they arrive, resulting in Hwan ripping them open.

   Sebin wakes up strapped to a cot in Yi's office as they try to convince the special investigator they are on their side. Yi believes them and says they know about Min being a fox and being accompanied by her brother’s ghost when Sebin says a shaman is being used to threaten Min into working with Hwan. Yi also reveals that the entire mission to Norandol was a set up to use them and Min to lure their uncle onto the Haetae, as well as telling Sebin of the dark dealings his family has done. Sebin becomes enraged that they were used as bait until the door opens and Rokuro shoots Yi with Euna and Jee close behind. Sebin turns into a tiger to escape and the Sun clan mercenary tells them their gun does not kill at that range. Thinking fast, Sebin says them want to inspect the captain's office and pretends to send a message to Hwan about Yi. As the group reaches the office, Rokuro translates for the cadets and their captain, they tell the three they must hand over any weapons before entering. They reluctantly agree, however Sebin is stopped and told to hand over the knife their aunt gave them, they reluctantly do so and enter. After entering the office, Sebin has Jee hack into the security feed as Min's charm wears off on him. Sebin then turns into a tiger and tries to subdue Rokuro, who fires a blaster at their leg, and Euna, upon revealing the charm wore off on her earlier, melts Roruko's weapon with a concealed blaster. Roruko says they are with them as they feel Hwan has gone to far. Sebin tells the group about their connection to Hwan and that Min is a fox spirit being blackmailed by a shaman Hwan brought with him. Sebin tells Jee to try and get a message about their uncle being on board to the Space Forces High Command as they, Roruko, and Euna. Search the bridge. Before leaving, Roruko tries and fails to get Uchida to turn on Hwan. The group finds that Uchida and a guard is missing and assume the two are warning Hwan as Sebin, takes out the remaining two guards. They find the bridge empty.

Along the way they learn that the escape pods are being guarded and when they reach the engine Sebin smells eight mercenaries. Sebin has Roruko join them in taking out the guards as Jee tries to hack the security robots and Euna acts as a sniper. Sebin leaps down and transforms as they are stunned by blaster fire. Rokuro and Euna follow suit as Jee gets the security robots to fight for them. However the atmosphere in the vent turns off and Euna pushes Jee out before it seals off. After taking out the mercenaries, Euna is cut free and lands just as Jee opens the hatch to the engine room. However Hwan speaks over the intercom, saying how Sebin will be branded as a traitor to both the Space Forces and their family. The four head into the engine room and become startled when the door does not close. Roruko gives them noise canceling headphones in case Hwan brings Min just as a blast goes off, realizing to late they fell into a trap.

Hwan mocks Sebin by saying the clan will disown them for this, and Sebin turns into a tiger to attack Min, realizing to late they should have targeted Sena. Min is able to charm them due to the headphones vanishing when they transformed and says to get Shield away from the fighting. They reluctantly obey Min's orders and takes the dog in their mouth and runs away as the fighting continues. Once they are far enough away, Sebin realizes with Shield out of the picture they can help Min take out the shaman. They smell out a ready to eat meal and use it to bribe the dog into getting onto the bathroom of a bunk room. Once the dog is eating inside, they seal him in, take the dessert from the meal for themself, and rush to rejoin the battle. Sebin returns only to find Min alone and realize she charmed them go get the dog away. She explains how she charmed Sena into not exercising Jun before Hwan and the others took her away. They hear Jee over a communication device, thankfully he is alive, and learns that the gate crystals still have some juice in them and that he will try to disable it, but also that Hwan has disabled the escape pods. Realizing that their uncle plans on taking everyone with him if he fails, they order Jee to reactivate the escape pods as Hwan returns, wearing earplugs to block out Min's charm, with Uchida and five other mercenaries. After mocking Sebin with their family honor again, they have Min charm them into not giving up no matter what as Jun creates an opening. Sebin dodges the enemy fire in tiger form as the Kim siblings evacuate the area. As they are getting tired , they take human shape and gesture for Hwan to remove his earplugs. They plead with Hwan to not go through with his plan, to see the errors of his ways and reminds him they are family. As he things of Sebin's words, Uchida and the mercenaries open fire on Sebin before Hwan turns into a tiger and takes out all six. Sebin then passes out.
