Soon Patty Roller arrives on a talking horse haint, Twennymiles. When Granny demands they leave, the lights go out and the children start screaming.

   They drive north in silence and meet up with Mami Wata, Nyame, and Keelboat Annie aboard the
   River Queen
   . Tristan waits outside a room as she and the others talk. When she exits, she silently passes by Tristan. The River Queen comes to an abrupt holt near St. Louis as she tells them to come outside. They head to the bow to see half a dozen ships occupied by redliners, who demand they handover Tristan quickly as they need to move. The gods stand in front of the boy as he sneaks away. As he looks for a lifeboat, Ayanna spots him and says they are friends and she will help him. Thandiwe arrives and teases the two as she shows them a new raft. The three and John skirt around the
   Illinois
   side of the river as they struggle to think of their next move. When Tristan reveals he brought Gum Baby and Tristan and the girls hug, he thinks he knows where Cotton is and says John can help. Tristan tells her and Thandiwe John's story as he subconsciously takes control of the raft and flies them to the middle of nowhere. They use Gum Baby's phone to find that they are over a place called National City, but only see fields. After the girls question how John could find Cotton, Tristan realizes Cotton is hiding them in a different realm. The girls take Tristan's hands and they see a city being built out in fire. They find the train station and discover the missing children with pieces of Alke in them being herded on to a train. They spot Old Angola, having almost tripled in size, as they plot their next move. After deciding to take out the plantation monster, John stands up. They evade the plantation monster to the best of their abilities as the train with the spirits departs. Thinking quickly, Tristan tries to read the stories of all the persecuted at one. He succeeds for the most part, but becomes a target for Old Angola. The plantation monster attacks the raft and Tristan falls off.

   She and Thandiwe search for hours but find no trace of Tristan before returning to the River Queen. Later the other gods come to the river boat as Tristan calls to tell them he is on a train and found Junior, but that King  Cotton has his bracelet. The gods panic as she asks Tristan for a location, he reports that they are heading to Chicago. She and Thandiwe meet up with Tristan, John, and Junior and they figure out a plan to stop Old Angola.

They strike to no avail as Cotton goes to grab Tristan, fortunately John Henry appears and blocks the haint. Cotton attacks John Henry with little success as she and her friends regroup. They watch as Cotton almost over powers the steel driving man and help get civilians away safely. Just then the other gods arrive and box Cotton in, however Tristan realizes it is a trap and warns the gods to late as Patty Roller leads hundreds of breakers into battle against the gods.
