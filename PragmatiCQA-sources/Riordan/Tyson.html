While the school did take care of him during school hours, he still had to fend for himself outside of school. He eventually met and befriended

   Tyson first appeared when Percy met him at
   Meriwether College Prep
   , the school they both went to. Percy was told Tyson was a freak, and Percy would always defend him. Tyson and Percy were friends, and no one else wanted to be associated with them. That day at school, the English teachers had let all the kids in the recess without any adults in order to simulate a book they had to read called

   Matt Sloan

  <p key="ac9cf711-76e3-4c24-9a62-a955424ba9f9">
   Later during gym class, Tyson asked Percy to watch over him and block him from others' views while he changed into his gym clothes because the other kids would sometimes pick on him since he had terrible scars on his back. Percy never asked about the scars since he lacked courage. Once they entered the gym, Matt Sloan made himself and Percy team captains but picked all the bigger and stronger kids for his team (including several giants disguised as children from Detroit) while Tyson ended up on Percy's. Other team members were Corey Bailer, a computer geek; Raj Mandali, the calculus whiz; and six others with unknown names. Tyson noticed quickly that the three new kids on Matt's side,
   Marrow Sucker
   ,
   Skull Eater
   , and
   Joe Bob
   smelled funny.

  <p key="511af356-1eac-404e-8c90-7af8547d2551">

   , who started attacking the gym with
   flaming dodgeballs
   . Just as Percy was about to be hit, Tyson stood in front of him and caught the two dodgeballs heading in his direction, which was when Percy discovered that he was immune to fire. He then sent them back at Marrow Sucker and Skull Eater, who was quickly turned to dust. Joe Bob later managed to hit Tyson, sending him sliding against the back wall of the gym. Percy took the giant's attention away from Tyson but was almost killed before Annabeth attacked the monster from behind, taking off her
   invisibility cap
   .

  <p key="4fd6beb2-96fe-4ce3-888a-e1df5571502e">
   Annabeth told Percy and Tyson to follow her outside, as she knows they would be blamed for the destruction of the gym. Tyson called Annabeth pretty, which she reacts to with revulsion. Annabeth called on the
   Gray Sisters' Taxi
   , but they refused to take Tyson until Annabeth promised extra pay. During the entire ride to

   wasn't functioning properly. Percy sprung into action, but he told Tyson to stay behind out of fear of him being hurt. However, Percy is quickly put in danger and almost burned alive, when Annabeth told Tyson to save Percy and giving him permission to enter the camp. Tyson stepped in between Percy and the bull, taking the blast of fire. However, he remained unharmed and smashed the head of one bull with his fists. It was then that Annabeth noticed that Percy did not know what Tyson really was. She told him to look at Tyson closely, which Percy did and saw that he only had one eye, meaning he was a

   Percy did not take this well, feeling that he went from a real hero at camp to the laughing stock of the camp. Other campers started to bully him and he did not take this well. He would even try and distance himself from Tyson and say he was like a distant relative whenever Tyson was not around. This eventually led to a fight with Annabeth while building a
   chariot
   , resulting in Percy and Annabeth building separate chariots instead of one like they had planned. Tyson used his knowledge of forging, which he had learned from

Being immune to heat, he managed to give the ship more power while holding it together long enough for the ship to get through before it exploded which presumably killed Tyson though it is later revealed he managed to survive. When Annabeth and Percy land on an island, Annabeth explained that Tyson could have survived, but it was half-hearted and Percy felt great guilt about the way he had treated Tyson.

     While growing up on the streets, Tyson would pray to Poseidon for help and a friend. After Tyson arrives at Camp Half-Blood, Poseidon claims Tyson as his son, which earns him a lot of ridicule but excites him as it brings him and Percy together. Tyson later tells Percy that he believed Poseidon failed him, but then answered his prayer by sending him a brother.
    </p>
    Poseidon later visits Tyson in his dreams and invites him to work in the Cyclops forges, an offer which he takes. Poseidon becomes protective of Tyson, much to his dismay. While Tyson wants to help his father fight Oceanus in

     Percy and Tyson knew each other before they knew they were related as they went to the same school. Percy would try and protect him from bullies, but would never look at Tyson directly. Unknown to Percy, Tyson's presence had been shielding him from monsters all year. When

It wasn't until the ship they were on exploded that Percy began to think of Tyson as a brother, thinking he had sacrificed himself to save him and Annabeth. When they are reunited, Percy is happy. At one point, Tyson tells Percy that after his hard life on the streets, he prayed to Poseidon for a friend and Poseidon sent him a brother which he is very happy about.
    </p>
    Over the rest of the series, Percy treats Tyson like a real brother and has come to accept him, even his crushing bear hugs. Even when apart, the two remain in touch. Tyson is always happy to spend time with his brother and help him in whatever way he can, like fixing his weapons and protecting him in battle. After Percy went missing in

   The film depiction of Tyson differs greatly from the books. He appears to be more intelligent and more articulate but is still incredibly clumsy. He also prefers to hide his status as a Cyclops by wearing sunglasses. He admits that he is afraid that he is the monster he is seen as, due to an incident where he smiled after scaring a group of Boy Scouts. In spite of feeling like an outcast because of what he is, he maintains a youthful outlook on life, having faith in his father and taking joy in the wild ride of the Chariot of Damnation. He also looks up to Percy and willingly puts himself in danger for him, believing Percy would do the same for him. It is also shown in the film that Tyson is able to heal himself with water like Percy.

   His past is not explored in great detail, but he reveals that when he was living in the mountains, he accidentally scared a group of Boy Scouts. He arrives in Camp Half-Blood on his own, having been guided there by a glowing trident. He enters the camp due to its weakening defensive barrier. He presents himself first at the Big House to Mr. D and Chiron, who in turn informed Percy. Shortly after being teased by Clarrise, Tyson helps save her from a

   After Percy, Grover and Annabeth decide to go on the quest for the Golden Fleece, Tyson sneaks after them, making a great deal of noise due to his full pack. In spite of Annabeth's misgivings about having a cyclops on the quest, Grover is eager to have him accompany them after hearing from Tyson that the fleece is guarded by Polyphemus. Exasperated by Tyson's conspicuousness, Annabeth sprays him with a bottle of the Mist to hide his single eye.

On the ship, they are quickly captured, and Annabeth believes that Tyson intentionally had them captured by making noise. They manage to escape from the ship in a life-raft, but Tyson's Mist-induced disguise wears off, returning him to his normal cyclopean appearance, which reminds him of his past of rejection. In an effort to cheer him up, Percy offers to let him steer the ship with the thermos of the four winds, which he accidentally drops into the Sea of Monsters.

   On the island of Polyphemus, Tyson tried to reason with the giant cyclops but fails, since Polyphemus sees him as a traitor to their kind for siding with demigods. After trapping Polyphemus in his cave, Tyson takes a crossbow bolt meant for Percy, falling from a ledge into an underground stream. He later returns to save Percy from Luke, revealing that the water had healed him. He returns with the other demigods and is told by Percy that he does not need to hide who he is anymore.
