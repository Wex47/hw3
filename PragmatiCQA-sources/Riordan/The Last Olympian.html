   to fight for Olympus instead of his domain in the sea. They then help Percy climb on to Poseidon's throne where he is able to telepathically communicate with his father. Though Percy almost combusts as a result of Poseidon's anger that anyone else dared to sit on his throne, Percy is successful in convincing his father to fight along with the other gods against Typhon. At that moment, Thalia comes in to tell them that Kronos's army has reached the doors of Olympus.

By doing so, he has cut himself, his vanguard, and Percy’s group (composed of himself, Annabeth, Grover, and Thalia) off from the bulk of his army and from Hades. As Percy’s group fight off Kronos' vanguard, Kronos, along with Ethan, makes his way up to Olympus, where he starts to obliterate it.

   Annabeth continues to try calling out to Luke, and is tossed across the throne room in return. Annabeth, now seriously weakened, tries one last time to bring Luke out by reminding him of his promise to her: that they would always be a family. The fact that he had hurt Annabeth spurs Luke to regain control of his body.

   Percy tries to defend Annabeth as he wrongfully thinks that Luke still has evil intentions against them, causing Kronos to repossess the body. Luke, however, struggles to keep control. Luke tells Percy that in order to defeat Kronos, he must be slain by his own hand as Kronos would regain control if anyone else approaches him aggressively. Percy picks up Annabeth's knife, and though he initially decides to kill Luke himself, he gives the knife to Luke. Luke then stabs himself in his own weak spot. Because of his sacrifice, the Titan lord is defeated. His body is taken away by the Fates.

   . Lastly, the gods offer Percy immortality, but Percy declines, instead asking for a different wish. He asks them to claim all demigods they have sired as soon as they reach thirteen or as soon they have reached camp. He also asks that Hades and the minor gods be respected and given a cabin for their children at camp. Plus, Percy asks for the Big Three Pact to be broken, saying the pact 'didn't work'. Because the gods swore on the River Styx, they must oblige his wish, though some of them are uncomfortable with it. He is then congratulated by the gods.
