   Tristan grew up as a poor child in a two-room
   house
   in
   Tahlequah
   ,
   Oklahoma
   with his father
   Thomas McLean
   . His mother has never been mentioned. His father would talk about the old Cherokee tales that he knew, such as the snake song, the constellation of an Armadillo, and Ghost Country, a place where you could talk to the dead. However, while interested in the stories, Tristan never truly believed them.

   . While he and Piper would joke about how silly the poster was, the movie itself became a big hit and rocketed Tristan's career. He went on to play roles as a Latino teacher, an Israeli spy, and a Syrian terrorist in a James Bond movie. Piper helped him research for a role in a movie involving
   Greek mythology
   by helping look up information. However he would always turn down Native American roles, including a several million dollar offer to play Tonto in a Lone Ranger film. When Piper asked why, he claimed that he felt Native American roles were too close to home for his liking, though, if the perfect Native American role was offered he says he may accept.

   . While the things were normally small, Tristan did not know how to handle the problem and would send her to different boarding schools. Eventually, Piper stole a BMW car right before Tristan told her they were going on vacation to Grandpa Tom's cabin, and Piper hid the information from him. The car owner pressed charges and
   Jane
   , Tristan's secretary, worked out a deal, resulting in Tristan sending her to the
   Wilderness School

   The first time Tristan is brought up is when Leo made a comment about how if the popular girls at the Wilderness School knew who her father was, they would be worshiping Piper and saying things like "We're not worthy." It is later learned that Tristan is a popular movie star and has played many important parts, one of his first being the King of Sparta. He thought the movie poster of the film looked funny, but it has became very popular and has sold many copies. When Piper arrived at

   In one of Piper's flashbacks, she remembered when he told her why he did not play any Cherokee parts, as it would be too close to home. He also does not believe in any god(s) because if he knew they did exist, he would always blame them if things went wrong. In another flashback, he found out from his assistant
   Jane
   that Piper stole a BMW, but instead of talking to her about it, he goes along with everything that Jane says and sends her to the Wilderness School.

When she calls Jane to find out where he is, she brushes her off and claimed that even if she does not know where he is, he would vanish sometimes, so she had yet to call the cops or file a missing persons report.

   He is described as a handsome man of Cherokee descent with a perfect smile, dimpled chin, twinkly dark eyes, and closely cropped black hair. He has a sad look in his eyes, which he claims is because the Cherokee carry generations of pain and suffering with them. He has a fashionably scruffy beard, like he has not shaved in two days. When in the captivity of Enceladus, he is described as wearing torn slacks, with bare, mud-caked feet. While he was held hostage, his chest was scratched and his hands were handcuffed behind his back.

   Tristan had a somewhat strained relationship with his daughter. Before he got into acting, the two would spend a lot of time together and talk about old Cherokee stories that Thomas McLean told them. When Tristan first got into acting, him and his daughter would joke about his role and the movie poster. When the movie became a big hit however, Tristan found that he had less time for Piper and did not understand why she kept stealing things (which she did to gain his attention). He eventually left most of his decisions up to his assistant,
   Jane
   . However, the two still get along as best they can and after the events of

   Thomas McLean is Tristan's father. Thomas told his son old Cherokee stories, which Tristan never believed or probably did not want to believe. While this left some distance between the father and son, even after Thomas died, Tristan could not sell his father's old house and most likely never will. He was deeply affected when his father died of cancer.
