To keep it from happening when no one's watching, Sadie purposefully cracks open Setne's prison and once he gets out, he's easily tracked by Walt and Anubis who are able to see ghosts even while they are invisible, Setne having either forgotten that or underestimated the pair's death magic. Setne moves around Brooklyn House as if he owns it, takes a trip to

   He has an ambitious personality, as said by Rick Riordan in his blog. However, even his name, Setne, is said to be evil. Setne is never seen without the Seven Ribbons of Hathor, the only items that keep him in check, and numerous magical precautions. He is rather persuasive, as he evaded oblivion for eons, either by getting a lighter sentence, a plea bargain or getting away. When he was alive, he'd stop at nothing to possess the secrets of the universe. He wanted to be a god, not the eye of a god, but a full-fledged immortal which

Despite having a way to destroy a god or even Apophis himself, Setne never planned to actually use it to destroy one, instead of planning to blackmail them instead. Even when given the chance to destroy Apophis, he simply planned to blackmail the being instead. However, while Setne loves Chaos and causing it, he does not want the world destroyed, or at least not the

   world because he wants some for himself and is thus willing to work against Apophis to a point. Despite trying to kill Carter a few times, Setne showed some fondness for the boy, though he thought Carter was too trusting. After binding him up, Setne actually saved Carter's life by stopping him from rolling into the Sea of Chaos and promised to come back and spare Carter in his new world because of how funny and naive he found him. Setne, along with Amos, is one of the few Egyptian magicians to know about the Greek Olympian gods before Percy and Carter meet.
