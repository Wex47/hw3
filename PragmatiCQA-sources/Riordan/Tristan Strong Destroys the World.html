As DJ Kulture struggles, Tristan holds onto him and pushes away as they near the water. Tristan lands on the beach and injures his right wrist. DJ Kulture crawls out of the lake berating Tristan for his actions as onlookers surround them. Tristan uses his bracelet to look at his necklace and realizes it is made up of stories, with one trophy being a knitting nettles. Tristan demands DJ Kulture tells him where he got the knitting needle and he refuses. Tristan activates his bracelet again and summons the boxing gloves and lands two punches despite his injured wrist. DJ Kulture's birds start to swarm around Tristan as the vulture picks him up and drops him repeatedly. When Tristan mentions his grandmother, DJ Kulture mentions he guarded her for the Shamble Man and called her off limits. Just as he is about to eat Tristan, Ayanna and Junior show up and hit the birds with rocks, scaring them away. Tristan mentions a plan to his companions he distracts the buzzard as the others pelt him with rocks and Gum Baby, who flies in on a sap covered raft, crashes into the vulture, trapping him on the raft.

She crashes the raft into the dome of the City of Lakes and they jump off into a dried river bed. As they get to their feet, invisible guards spot them and take them inside.

Cookie takes them away and tells them Big Big has contacted the Shamble Man, but she can get them out with their belongings if they can help her find her skin. They realize she is Lady Night and ask her to fix the SBP. She agrees to, but she needs her skin first. Just then Gum Baby crashes in on the Flying Raft and starts insulting Big Big. They use this as a distraction and Tristan sneaks out to get the skin. However Big Big finds him and tosses him aside. While they fight, Lady Night gets her skin back and Big Big, whose name is revealed to be Clifford, apologizes as he gives Tristan and his friends back their items and Lady Night wraps him in a cloak.

As the crack starts to heal, Lady Night explains that they need stories to fix the SBP, but it risks attracting the Shamble Man. As Gum Baby comes to the table, she looks at the rice and mocks Tristan for putting the SBP in it. When Tristan thinks of his grandmother, he realizes he doesn’t have to tell the stories, but rather listen and use the energy they give off to heal it. He takes the pot to the stage and tells the club goers that he needs their help and to tell their stories.

He sees the good times they had with their father and honorary uncle, who he recognized as

As Tristan's friends tell him to stop, it sends iron monsters to attack them, they dodge every one as he recalls Gum Baby pelting Uncle Cotton with sap as he was defeated and guesses it hardened to form the mask. As they fly away, the others ask Tristan about their next move as he tries to figure out the connection between Brer Bear's actions. He pitch the idea of the bear wanting to destroy the symbol's of power, but Anansi states Brer Bear isn’t powerful enough to do so.

Despite the others telling him to stay with them, he goes over to the water goddess, who is bound in chains and her feet are in a puddle, and frees her. When she is freed, she tackles him to the ground and says it is to late. She shows him a vision of what Nyanza was like before she was taken and confirms that Brer Bear is being manipulated by Uncle Cotton. They snap back to the present as the tree is imploding. He helps Mami Wata to the raft and gives her his bracelet to strengthen her. As they get out, the tree becomes a geyser of water and wood thanks to Mami Wata as they move to safety.

   and rushes towards it. He picks it us , and it adapts to his size, and activates his boxing gloves. After building up power, he tosses the hammer into the sky and watches it vanish. He finds his grandmother and tells her they need to leave, but she insists on helping the Alkeans. Soon he sees his companions and Brer Bear under the keelboat, with it being turned upside down and acting as an umbrella. He sees a recovered John Henry pulling a boat full of Alkeans with Sarah and Rose shielding some of them with their wings. Nyame appears carrying multiple babies just as

   As they all pile into the keelboat, they see another hole forming in the sky and Tristan and Nana see the family farm. As the others ask Tristan what his plan is, he reveals that they are going to leave Alke, but with their stories he can hopefully rebuild their world. He has Mami Wata, Sarah, and Rose direct them towards the tear in the sky as he has the other gods hold the quilt while he imbues it with the stories of the locations and people of the dying world. Just as Tristan finishes, they reach the tear and he passes out.

   . Two days later he wakes up to the alarm on the SBP and the smell of his grandfather bringing him a plate of pancakes and bacon. When he asks about his grandmother, who has been confined to her room until further notice, his grandfather says she is the same. His grandfather leaves and Anansi tells him he received a message. When he clicks on it, they see pictures of those who went missing on the journey. He rushes out of the house and to the keelboat, now acting as a treehouse, and is let in by the gods who reside in it. He is somberly greeted by Nyame, Brer Rabbit, Brer Bear, Keelboat Annie, Lady Night, Mami Wata, and
   John Henry
   . Before he can tell them what he found, they show Tristan a piece of Uncle Cotton's mask and tell him they sense nothing inside and show him that half the bottles have been broken, meaning more evil spirits are loose. After that he shows them pictures of Ayanna, Junior, much to Anansi's joy, and Gum Baby. After realizing the SBP can track Alkeans and
   haints
   in his world, Tristan vows to find them all.
