Magnus chases the attacker, who was lurking on the roof opposite their side of the street, but misses a leap and narrowly avoids sliding off a church roof. The "goat assassin", who is standing at the top of the roof, tells Magnus to stay away from Provincetown. He flees and Magnus throws his enchanted sword Jack after him, which buys him time to pull himself up. He injures the assassin, but a howl in the distance causes him to freeze up. His opponent gives him one last warning before disappearing over the roof's edge. Magnus meets back up with Sam at the café, who now has a mysterious bruise under her left eye, and tells her about what happened. They both begin to suspect Loki is behind this and decide that they need to retrieve Thor's hammer as soon as possible in order to prevent a horde of Jotunn from invading Midgard. After Magnus tells Sam about the supposed location of the hammer, she says that they will require Blitzen and Hearthstone's help to successfully enter the wight's tomb. Sam reveals that they have been hiding in one of
   Mimir's
   safe houses, but does not tell him why. She promises to explain everything to him later and that she will see him at the evening feast in Valhalla, where she will also introduce him to her "brother", the einherji she picked up earlier.

He notices that the floor is littered with broken pieces of ceramic bowls and cups, and when he inspects one of them, he finds the initials "A.F." scratched onto it as well as a decorative stamp of two snakes curled in an "S" pattern with their tails looped around each other's heads.

Magnus and Jacks discuss the appearance of another child of Loki appearing just as the mark appears on Randolph's photo as well as Mjolnir being lost again. T.J. pops in to bring them to the daily battle, which, being a Thursday battle means in addition to the regular fights to the death, the einherji must also face lindworms. They meet up with Mallory and Halfborn Gunderson and are introduced to the new hall mate Alex Fierro, a gender fluid and transgender teenager as well as a child of Loki. The group is attacked by one of the lindworms, which Alex reveals is named Grimwolf. This is an unexpected situation as Grimwolf is one of the oldest lindworms and normally lives at the roots of Yggdrasil, which causes Alex to suspect that it was sent by Loki. As Magnus tries to distract Grimwolf for Alex, he experiences a searing pain on his face and he suddenly sees himself in Randolph's study with Loki standing over him. Loki talks to Magnus through Randolph and tells him that he is giving him an invitation to a wedding where Sam is the bride and that Magnus is tasked with acquiring the bride price. Loki claims that he will give Mjolnir in exchange for Sam's cooperation in the wedding, but when he takes notice of Alex he tells Magnus she is not invited to the wedding and as his vision turns back to Valhalla, Magnus' body begins to overheat. Alex explains that Loki is channeling his power through Magnus and that the explosion will destroy most of the courtyard, so Alex decapitates Magnus to cut him off from Loki.

   While dead, Magnus dreams about Randolph being on a yacht in the middle of a storm with his family (his wife Caroline, his oldest daughter Aubrey, and his youngest daughter Emma) and witnesses them be thrown into the ocean by a wave. He then has another dream where his head is floating in a bathtub and he sees Mimir talking to Blitz and Hearth about having to go somewhere. While Hearth seems concerned about Blitz's safety, Blitz insists that they have to go and help Magnus. Magnus goes into another dream where his head is inside a pickle jar inside some kind of bar, where he overhears the giants Thrym and Thrynga talking about Thrym's marriage to Sam. After being resurrected, Magnus makes his way to evening banquet just in time to witness Alex's heroic deed. Its revealed that Alex tried to defend an elder man (possibly a demigod) from three wolves who were children of

After the banquet Magnus meets with Sam and discusses his dreams with her. She explains that Loki visited her grandparents and revealed everything to them before dropping off an invitation.

   The next day, the two of them fly on a winged horse to Cape Cod to meet Blitz and Hearth. When they meet up, a prophecy is revealed to have been read by Hearth which announces Blitz's death. They find the wight's barrow in an ancient underground tomb. They open a coffin with the words "Blood River" written all over it, causing the wight inside to spring to life, which introduces itself as Gellir, who is in possession of a sword called Skofnung. He also reveals that Mjolnir is not in the barrow. The wight says he needs to kill the group for him and his men to break free of the tomb but they need to hold a meeting before they get to it. Evetually they agree to kill the four of them, but they manage to defeat the wight and his men. Soon after, however, Randolph and Loki appear. Loki causes Sam to stop breathing and orders Randolph to unsheathe Skofnung, despite the rule about not being drawn in the presence of women. Another rule is that it can't sheathed until it has drawn blood, so Loki has Randolph stab Blitz with the sword. Magnus tries to heal the wound but Loki says the only way to heal the wound is to used the Skofnung Stone. To save Blitz form bleeding out Magnus collapses the barrow and turns Blitz to stone.

   He reveals that Hearth's mother, Greta, was involved in a car accident that resulted in her death and that he blames it on Hearth running away. Magnus finds that the Skofnung Stone is in Mr. Alderman's possession and must be given willingly to be able to be used. They ask to borrow the stone, but Mr. Alderman says that Magnus, as a son of Frey, needs to help Alderman raise his social standing and Hearth must pay his wergild. It is revealed that Hearth's brother Andiron was killed by a monster in a well behind the house and Hearth was blamed for his death because he couldn't hear his brother being attacked. As a result, Hearth must pay a wergild, a blood debt in which he must accumulate enough gold to completely cover the skin rug of the beast. Inge mentions that there is a dwarf in Alfheim called
   Andvari
   , or the Careful One, who has a horde of gold large enough to cover the rug. She tells them he is living as a fish in the river in the woods behind the mansion. Magnus and Hearth manage to catch Andvari and get him to reveal the location of his horde. They also take Andvari's cursed ring, even though he warns them that all who have taken it suffer terrible consequences. They use Andvari's treasure to pay the wergild and use the Skofnung Stone to heal Blitz after turning him back to normal in running water. Later that night, Mr. Alderman throws a party to be seen with Magnus, but the curse of the ring causes him to go crazy and start accusing the guests of trying to steal his treasure. He summons water spirits called
   Nøkks
   as security and makes them start attacking the guests. The three of them manage to escape the mansion, Jack cuts a portal between worlds near the well, and they wind up in Midgard.

They are invited by Heimdall to walk upon the Bifrost and talk to him. Heimdall tells them that a mass of giants are discussing an alliance with Loki through the wedding of Thrym and Sam before their invasion of Midgard takes place. Sam makes a vow before Heimdall, as he is the guardian of the sacred marriage bed, that she will never marry or pretend to marry anyone other than Amir. While looking for the goat killer, Heimdall takes a picture of a place in the Jotunheim called Utgard Lanes that has a sign telling Magnus to come and get the information to interfere with Loki's plan, and Magnus realizes the goat killer was actually

   Stanley
   . Sam flies with Hearth to the Jotunheim, while Magnus, Alex and Blitz ride Stanley. Soon after entering they are knocked off Stanley by a low hanging branch, which turns out to actually be the shoestring of a giant named
   Tiny
   . Tiny points them in the direction of Utgard Lanes, but in order to have him vouch for them he tells them they need to bring his giant bowling ball bag to the Lanes by tomorrow morning. Blitz gets the idea to give the bag a name to make it a dwarven item and enchant it to magically change size, using Jack as a needle to sew in magical thread made with Magnus' hair and Alex's blood. As Blitz and Jack work on the bag, Magnus and Alex get to talking and he learns that Loki is Alex's mother. After the bag is finished, they travel to Utgard Lanes and meet up with Utgard-Loki who reveals to already have Sam and Hearth. Utgard-Loki explains that even though he wants to prevent Loki's plan, the five of them must prove themselves to the other giants by performing impressive feats. The first includes an ax-throwing contest between Sam and a kid giant called Little Billy. Little Billy seems to win, but Sam throws her ax into him and reveals him to be Fear, which can only be defeated by being attacked head-on. Next, Hearth challenges a giant to arcade games and defeats him by surpassing the giant's skee-ball score with his pinball score. Blitz's challenge is a complete makeover where he makes an extremely ugly giant attractive (at least to other giants). Magnus and Alex take on the giants in bowling. At first they are unable to hit the pins because there is a portal to Midgard in front of their pins, but they manage to close it and beat the giants. With that they buy five minutes for Utgard-Loki to give them information before the giants are allowed to chase them down. Utgard-Loki reveals that Loki intends to free himself with the Skofnung Sword and manipulated the events of Mjolnir's theft to get the sword, since having the sword as the bride price means that it will go to the father of the bride by jotun tradition.

Alex decides to pose as Sam so that she can keep her vow and because he/she believes that he/she can resist Loki's control over his children. After they agree to infiltrate the wedding with Alex posing as Sam, Thor gives them his chariot to ride to the wedding. Thor explains he can concentrate to see through Otis and Marvin's eyes and that when the hammer is summoned by Thrym, he will lead a squad of gods and einherjar underground to retrieve the hammer and slaughter the giants.

They arrive to Loki chained up on the floor with a large snake dripping venom on his face, with his wife Sigyn at his side, trying to keep the venom out of his eyes with a small bowl. Loki asks Alex to come forward to confirm that the bride is Sam. Alex transforms to look like Sam, and Loki assumes Sam is Alex and the ceremony gets underway. Loki has Randolph retrieve the Skofnung Sword from Magnus and just as he tells him to cut him free, Alex breaks character and attacks Thrym.
