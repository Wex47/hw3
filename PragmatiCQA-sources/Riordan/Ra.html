As Chaos tried to overthrow and disrupt the delicate balance between Chaos and Order, Apophis tried to swallow the sun god as the ancient prophecy stated; if the Serpent would be successful in doing this, the world would be destroyed and fall into Chaos. However, the triumph of Chaos did not happen since the gods were there to protect Ra, the Lord of Order.

   Ra then grew old, and man no longer feared him or his laws. Angered by this, he summoned

Unfortunately, the lion goddess Sekhmet proved uncontrollable as she began to kill anyone, and no mortal or god was strong enough to stop her. Ra, now feeling remorseful over what had happened, helped the magicians and mortals by creating a remedy that could bring Sekhmet down. He ordered those at Heliopolis to brew thousands of beer, mix them with crushed red ochre and pour it at a field. The huntress then stopped upon seeing the plain flooded and began drinking the brew, thinking it was her enemies' blood. Intoxicated, Ra then was able to change her name into

   Some time later, Ra, while ruling the gods and traveling in the sky with his Eye, Bast and his lieutenant, the chaotic deity Set, became forgetful and senile. Though the gods doubted Ra was still capable of being their king, none were brave or clever enough to take the position from him without falling into the influence of Chaos. Then came the goddess Isis, who, with her other siblings, were reborn again, and was in a relationship with Osiris. Isis, who was more clever than a million men and knew almost all the secrets of the Earth, was impatient of Ra voluntarily retiring and formulated of a way to make her husband, Osiris, become king. As Ra descended during the night, Isis slipped a snake into his resting place that she had created by mixing clay and the sun god's drool, which in turn bit Ra in the ankle.
  </p>
  <p key="9f42bf04-f6a0-45a7-bb51-aa068c805171">
   Ra cried in pain and the other gods naturally rushed to his side. No one, not even Thoth, could cure the poison which was consuming his very being. Naturally, of course, the healer Isis appeared and stated that there was nothing she could do unless Ra would tell her his secret name.
  </p>
  <p key="112564d9-c591-40c0-9f82-6ea2a2c6f8cb">
   Ra, who was tired and weary of the poison, then told Isis his secret name which she used in her spell that successfully healed the sun god. Then Ra went into forced retirement as Isis demanded.
  </p>
  <p key="da866be8-a030-497c-9b0f-1d2884a13a17">
   Ra then used the third part of his soul, the morning sun Khepri to bind the Eye of Ra, Bast, and his enemy, the Chaos snake Apophis in eternal battle whilst in the abyss. After that, he slept and slowly faded into lasting twilight.

   or "Pillar", in Egyptian) where he was identified with the local sun-god Atum. In mythology, Ra is the king of the gods and god of the sky. To the ancient Egyptians, he represented light, warmth, and growth making him an important god and ruling over all the other gods, humans, ect. Ra was thought to travel on two solar boats called the Mandjet (the Boat of a Million of Years), or morning boat and the Mesektet, or evening boat. These boats took him on his journey through the sky and the underworld. When Ra traveled in his sun boat he was accompanied by various other deities including Sia (perception) and Hu (command) as well as Heka (magic power). Sometimes members of the Ennead helped him on his journey, including Set who overcame the serpent Apophis and Mehen who defended against the monsters of the underworld. Apophis, an enormous serpent, tried to stop the sun boat's journey every night by consuming it or by stopping it in its tracks with a hypnotic stare. In the evening the Egyptians believed that Ra set as Atum or in the form of a ram. The Mesektet or Night boat would carry Ra through the underworld back towards the east in preparation for his rebirth at sunrise. These myths of Ra represent the sunrise as the rebirth of the sun by the sky goddess Nut, thus attributing the concept of rebirth and renewal to Ra and strengthening his role as a creator god.

He is later joined by magicians from the House of Life after they defeat Apophis' minions and other gods summoned by Carter in his role as pharaoh. Ra gets swallowed by Apophis, but his sacrifice bought the time that was needed and Apophis was destroyed, releasing Ra as he exploded. With Apophis finally dead, Ra declared that the gods were to remove themselves from the mortal world for a time because with Chaos leaving the world, so must Order to ensure that a balance was maintained.

       Conflicting stories can be equally true. The sun is a ball of fire in space, yes. But its image you see as it crosses the sky, the life-giving warmth and light it brings to the earth—that was embodied by Ra. The sun was his throne, his source of power,his very spirit. But now Ra has retreated into the heavens. He sleeps, and the sun is just the sun. Ra’s boat no longer travels on its cycle through the Duat. He no longer lights the dark, and the dead feel his absence most keenly.

During the final battle against Apophis, Horus, who was merged with his host Carter, helped the reborn Ra battle Apophis and was instrumental to the Chaos Serpent's ultimate destruction by lending Carter his power. Afterwards, Ra abdicated his throne once more, and allowed Horus to become the leader of the gods again.

    Bloodstained Blade
    , but had a hard time controlling it because of Ra's sheer power. After reuniting with Ra on his boat, Zia allowed Ra to take her as a host and it allowed him to be reborn finally, something he attributed to her compassion. Before he leaves again for a very long time, he asks Carter to look after Zia for him, apparently aware of the two's romantic feelings for each other.

As the first god aside from being more powerful than others, he is the Lord of Ma'at and essential to the survival of the universe.
