   The next afternoon, when Apollo was walking by the riverside in Thessaly, Eros shot an arrow of love straight into his heart, causing him to fall instantly and hopelessly in love with a beautiful naiad who was bathing nearby named Daphne. He approached her and begged for her hand in marriage. Unfortunately for Apollo,
   Daphne
   had sworn off men due to the numerous tales of how being beloved by the gods had led many females to tragic endings, and therefore spurned his advances. Apollo has also wrote, in

As soon as Apollo's gaze fell on the lyre, he was deeply mesmerized by it and instantly forgot about the cows. After that, Hermes and Apollo became the best of friends. Their friendship was so firm that Apollo said to Hermes that he was the most beloved of the gods to him. Later on, Hermes became an

As soon as Zeus had fallen asleep, all four of them quickly tightly bound the King of Olympus with unbreakable and tightening golden chains. Even chained up and completely immobilized, an infuriated Zeus looked very intimidating. Finally, Poseidon attempted to reason with his brother and demanded that Zeus be a better ruler. Zeus refused, which prompted Hera to advocate leaving him chained up in his chambers until he agrees. Shortly thereafter, the four Olympians departed for the Throne Room for the first (and last) democratic meeting of the Olympian Council, which proved to be a very cumbersome task.

   For his murder of the Cyclopes, Apollo was forced by Zeus to live on Earth for a year again, stripped of his divinity and godly powers, and forced to serve the mortal King Admetus of Thessaly as a shepherd for a year. Fortunately for Apollo, Admetus was very hospitable and treated the banished god with great respect. As a reward for his hospitality, Apollo even persuaded the Fates to reprieve Admetus of his fated day of death, as long as Admetus could find someone willing to die in his place.

   When Diomedes injured Aeneas during a battle, Apollo rescued him after Aphrodite was wounded by Diomedes as well, trying to save her son, rebuking the latter lest he think fit to make attack upon a god again. He transported the Trojan to Pergamus where his wound was tended by his mother and sister. Throughout the war, he constantly drove on Hector and nearly destroyed the Greeks. At the behest of Zeus, Apollo used Zeus' Aegis to force the Greeks back to their ships. He also threw down the great wall the Greeks built, as easily as a child breaks a sandcastle, according to Homer: "Easy as when ashore an infant stands, And draws imagined houses in the sands; The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play, Sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away: Thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls; The toil of thousands in a moment falls".

   , by destroying his physical manifestation while he was at his weakest, as far as possible for his own realm. Apollo, however, warns Leo that any mortal close by would be destroyed if Gaea were to be defeated in such a way. Apollo tells Leo of the curse of Delos, the final ingredient for the Physician's Cure. When
   Leto
   was ready to give birth to Apollo and Artemis, Hera made all the nature spirits swear to reject Leto so she couldn't give birth. However, Delos was a floating island then, so Leto gave birth to the twins, causing the island to bloom yellow flowers out of happiness, but Delos became rooted then, so flowers picked by Apollo or Artemis on Delos are the curse of Delos. Leo trades Apollo a

   , a musical contraption that translates feelings into music in exchange for his help.

   After being turned into a mortal, it was evident that Apollo could be intensely selfish, given how he viewed his need of regaining his divinity as well as his issues of struggling with his newfound mortality as being more important than the troubles or concerns of others - including those of his own demigod children. However, even in the midst of this, Apollo still proved to be an open-minded and even, in a way, affectionate person, especially to his children: he supported the romantic relationship between his son,

After Jason's death, Apollo even cried on the plane the way back for everyone who sacrificed themselves. Apollo still brags about himself and acts like a god, but now he is more sentimental and protective of his friends.

    , Apollo had the ability to grant the gifts of longevity and naiad-hood to whomever he desired - he transformed his lover,
    Cyrene
    , into a naiad with a very long lifespan. He also grants the Sybil who wrote the Sibylline Books as many years of life as there were grains on the beach where they were; however, he regrets doing this. He also, like all gods, has the power to create new gods; however, this comes at a price. For every god he creates, he loses a piece of his own power as was seen with Hemithea and her sister. This creates very minor gods bestowed with only a tiny fraction of actual powers. The stronger he makes them, the weaker he becomes.

    After becoming a god again, he and his father share an awkward moment when the king of the gods asks the sun god what he learned from his time as a mortal. His father saying he has done him proud, but Apollo only thinks Zeus said that because of how he said that, he made his plan work (as in making him look a good leader), his heart did not melt, feeling that is was not a warm-and-fuzzy reconciliation with his father, and is incapable of loving him as who he is (‘let’s be honest: some fathers don’t deserve it. some aren’t  capable of it’). Even when they were alone Apollo supposed he could have raged and called bad names without getting punished, believing Zeus to have expected it, given his awkward self-consciousness at the moment. Yet Apollo believes it would not have changed him or make anything different between them. Only Wanting to be better than him, more human, and spending the least amount of time around him as possible. Even after Apollo said “I understand father”. ‘Zeus seemed to understand what I understand was not perhaps the same thing he understand, but he accepted the gesture, i suppose because he had little choice’.
