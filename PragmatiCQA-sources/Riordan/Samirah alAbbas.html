  <p key="551656c8-f1d6-4f70-9a79-76170084bbe6">
   Ayesha raised Sam by herself. Ayesha was headstrong and unconventional, but was seen as a rebel and an embarrassment by
   Jid
   and
   Bibi al-Abbas
   . Even though she was a doctor who helped people, her parents were old fashioned. They were raised in Baghdad, but fled to the US when Saddam Hussein was in power. It was a big deal for Ayesha to have a child out of wedlock. Ayesha died during Sam's childhood, so she was taken in by Jid and Bibi. She was seen as damaged goods, a bastard child. Sam missed Ayesha very much.

   What was also stressful for her was her double life. Her grandparents were old and their minds weren't flexible, so they had no idea about Sam's life as a Valkyrie or her parentage. So she had to lie to them and make excuses such as tutoring in order to leave the house, as well as having to be home for dinner to avoid getting in trouble. The Fadlans didn't know either, and she did not expect them to be happy that their son was betrothed to a pagan.
