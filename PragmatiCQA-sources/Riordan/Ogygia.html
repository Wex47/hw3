   Ogygia (pronounced /ɔː.ɡy.ɡí.a/) is a phantom island that exists everywhere and nowhere. It was designed as the prison for the nymph

   . It is a very gorgeous place, where there are
   invisible servants
   and a beautiful garden, made by Calypso herself. One of the garden's plants is
   moonlace
   . Its terrain is mostly grass-covered hills with pristine beaches all along the edges, though it has groves of cypress tree. It is apparently not very big as there were few places Leo Valdez could go and not see the ocean.

  <p key="0529b869-4021-4c42-a29c-f0b3757a2b4b">
   During Percy's time on Ogygia, Calypso explains that time moves differently on the island. For example, what feels like an hour on Ogygia, could be a week in normal time. When Percy returns to the mortal world, he has been gone for a couple of weeks.

   When Percy is leaving he says that he could come back and visit sometime, but Calypso tells him that that

   On and above the island, navigation readings are completely messed up with the compass Leo built spinning wildly and his GPS not working as well. When Leo manages to return to Ogygia, the fact that Festus' navigation readings are completely messed up elates Leo as it's a sign that they have succeeded.

   The only way off for heroes that Calypso falls in love with is
   a magical raft
   that will take them wherever they want to go. However, Calypso herself is prevented from using the raft to escape.

   suggests that Calypso simply lost her ability to control her magic, not her magic itself. With a jump-start from the goddess and training from
   Josephine
   , Calypso is able to regain control and usage of her magic although she remains mortal.

   an astrolabe
