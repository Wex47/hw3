Without noticing her father's presence at first, Athena proceeded to disarm her friend of her javelin and counterattacked, stabbing at Pallas's gut. However, Pallas was too slow because she was still going over her shock, so Athena ended up accidentally fatally piercing her with her sword.

This statue would eventually end up in the city of Troy, becoming known as the Palladium (meaning "Place of Pallas"), where women were allowed to claim sanctuary while men were forbidden from even looking at the statue. Since Pallas's statue greatly resembled Athena herself, people would eventually begin referring to the goddess herself as "Pallas Athena," which the goddess encouraged as it helped her keep Pallas's memory alive.

Enraged, Athena revealed herself and accepted the challenge as she herself had invented weaving. Each of them then made a tapestry: Athena's tapestry was of the gods together in glory and joy while Arachne's showed the gods making fools of themselves, though it was still beautiful. While Athena reluctantly admitted the contest was a tie, she was so infuriated by this deliberate insult to the gods that she destroyed the tapestry in rage and mercilessly beat on Arachne.

After seeing Arachne's body, Athena felt responsible for her death and decided to do her a favor. She turned Arachne into a spider so that she and all her children would be expert weavers forever. In other versions of the myth, Athena transformed Arachne into a spider directly after the contest as part of Arachne's punishment.

But Arachne was the one who sucked it all in. Soon, Arachne boasted about her great weaving. Athena, filled with rage, came down from Olympus and challenged her to a weaving competition. In the end, both were equally good, and Athena ripped Arachne's (which was a weaving about how bad the gods were) weaving to shreds, and Arachne, recognizing her wrongs, hung herself from the ceiling, ready to drop to her death. Athena was a goddess that gave second chances, and she pitied Arachne, so consequentially, she became the world’s first spider.

Apollo and Poseidon were temporarily stripped of their godly powers and forced to work as laborers on Earth for years, while Hera was tied up and suspended on a rope across the

   . Soon, Hera was freed by Hephaestus. Fortunately for her, Athena managed to completely evade Zeus's punishment by talking herself out of it, as well as due to their extremely close relationship as father and daughter (although it's quite possible Zeus didn't trust Athena as much as he used to since he gained a long-lasting distrust for Poseidon and Apollo from the riot and she was the one who wove the net the rioters used to capture Zeus, but eventually he got over it).

This extended to those who had offended her, as shown by how, despite her great anger towards Arachne, she still found Arachne's fellow citizens, who had benefited from Arachne and still quickly turned on their neighbor after she mercilessly beat on Arachne, to be disgusting for having laughed at the girl.

   described Athena's face is beautiful and regal but also somewhat scary, the way a warrior goddess should look. Unlike any dull grey item on the

   island, her stormy grey eyes are bright and "full of fierce energy." Percy also realized through her startlingly, cold grey stare that she would make a terrible enemy. He immediately recognized the brunette goddess as Annabeth's mother, to the extent where he almost addressed Athena as her daughter. Athena was viewed to be one of the most beautiful goddesses of all, given how she was perfectly capable of attracting male attention, but she employs her powers to do horrible things to them if they don't leave on her first warning.

Zeus admires Athena's incredible tactical skills since he wouldn't let her leave the battle with Typhon because she was his best strategist.

  <p key="4e471ee7-96fc-433f-bf4b-128081bf1f9d">
   While they were in the Parthenon, Percy sees 'Athena' written in Greek at the foot of her statue, and when he tells Annabeth, she wonders whether her mom really looks like the statue. Percy, in response, tells her 'We'll find out,' indicating that he is confident they will survive the quest and make it to Olympus.

   Annabeth also mentions that her mother had been speaking to her telepathically to help her, similar to how Poseidon spoke to Percy, saying that even though she had not seen her, she still felt close to her mother.

  <p key="5b07e025-aca3-461d-8838-76f99bd12140">
   The film version of Athena is less strict and did not show any sign of not liking Poseidon or Percy (even though Annabeth claimed that their parents "hate each other"). She even states that "War is not the answer," This is perhaps a little paradoxical, as she is a goddess of war. However being the goddess of strategy, she knew that a war between the gods was not the answer and would only lead to unneeded sacrifice.
