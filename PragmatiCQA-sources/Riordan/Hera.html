However, since Hera was a goddess (a member of a more beautiful and powerful race of immortals than the Titans), Kronos feared that Hera would one day overpower him and quickly proceeded to swallow her whole as well. Hera spent her childhood undigested in her father's stomach along with her sisters, and two younger brothers, who were swallowed shortly thereafter. Since they were immortal gods who couldn't truly die, all five of them had grown to their maturity undigested in Kronos' stomach.

In Zeus' Cave, at the base of Mount Ida, Hera happily reunited with her mother, who tearfully embraced her. Shortly thereafter, Hera and the other gods accepted Zeus as their leader and reached a unanimous consensus on declaring war against their tyrannical father. However, since the Titans were well-armed, and the gods still had no weapons, Hera agreed to help Zeus release their

He applied his excellent singing, dancing, and joking skills to woo Hera, but she wouldn't initially give in. Zeus made a bet with Hera that if she would ever confess her love for him, she would become his bride. A few days later, Zeus proceeded to generate a tremendous thunderstorm around Olympus and disguised himself as an injured cuckoo. The cuckoo flew into Hera's chambersÂ just as she was shutting her windows, and proceeded to fall on the marble floor. She took what she thought was a defenseless creature in her arms, dried its feathers, and revived it with some divine nectar. On the next morning, the cuckoo didn't seem inclined to leave, and affectionately rubbed its beak against Hera's finger. Hera admitted having grown quite fond of the bird herself and gently cuddled it in her arms. At that very instant, the cuckoo transformed into Zeus himself. Although she was embarrassed and outraged by her brother's deception, Hera was very impressed at Zeus' cleverness andÂ agreed to become his consort on the condition that he remained loyal to her a promise which Zeus would not uphold.

Shortly thereafter, the four Olympians departed for the
   Throne Room
   for the first (and last) democratic meeting of the Olympian Council, which proved to be a very cumbersome task. The violent thrashing and bellowing King of Olympus was found by the Nereid Thetis. After convincing Zeus to not throw the rioters to Tartarus, Thetis managed to find the Hekatonkheire

   Zeus remained true to his word, but he still punished them all. While Poseidon and Apollo were temporarily stripped of their godly powers and forced to do hard labour, Hera received the severest punishment of all: She was chained right above the terrifying

   . Every day, Zeus would visit her, threaten to sever the chains with his Master Bolt, and watch her tumble into the Void. HephaestusÂ could hear the wails of his mother all the way from Mount Olympus, which infuriated himÂ as he couldn't bear to hear her suffering such a harsh punishment. As a result, HephaestusÂ set his mother free with his tools. Hera tearfully embraced her son and promised to never to call him ugly ever again.
