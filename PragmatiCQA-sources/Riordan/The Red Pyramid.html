    Since their mother’s death, Carter and Sadie have become near-strangers. While Sadie has lived with her grandparents in London, her brother has traveled the world with their father, the brilliant Egyptologist, Dr. Julius Kane. One night, Dr. Kane brings the siblings together for a “research experiment” at the British Museum, where he hopes to set things right for his family. Instead, he unleashes the Egyptian gods Horus, Osiris, Isis, Nephthys and Set, who banishes him to oblivion, and forces the children to flee for their lives. Soon, Sadie and Carter discover that the gods of Egypt are waking, and the worst of them—Set—has his sights on the Kanes. To stop him, the siblings embark on a dangerous journey across the globe—a quest that brings them ever closer to the truth about their family, and their links to a secret order that has existed since the time of the pharaohs.

Amos explains that Egyptian gods are real and that there are many structures and symbols in America to prove that like the Washington Monument which is an Egyptian obelisk. He says that he and his dad were both magicians. He tells them that Julius's family hadn't practiced magic for generations until he married their mom. He explains that they combined the bloodline of two very powerful families. Despite their disbelief, Amos told them that the gods were just powerful beings and that magicians constantly fight them. He said that Julius Kane wanted to summon Orisis to bring their mom back from the dead. Sadie and Carter were raised separately because the House believed raising the two siblings together would cause them to become much too powerful. Carter recounts his dream to Amos and Amos says that dreaming like that means they traveled through the Duat. He believes that they are gaining power faster than he thought and goes to Phoenix to look around. He leaves them there to search around the house, but tells them not to go to the library.

   The creature that appeared was called the
   Set Animal
   and is described as big as a horse with rabbit ears and a forked tail. It's face was like an anteater, but with forked teeth and greyfur like a greyhound. Carter notices that the animal has glowing eyes, which Bast says must be because it has found them. Bast distracts the animal while Sadie and Carter turn into birds and fly to the airport. Despite their efforts, when they land, Sadie is unable to turn back into human again. As they are about to get taken by an officer, Bast appears and tells them that they are going to a falcon-racing competition. Bast tells Carter about the Duat locker, and that he could store and take things from that locker. Carter quickly creates a combination and puts his bag into the locker. Just as they get past airport security, the Set Animal charges in. The regular people see it as a rabid moose. Carter tells Bast and Sadie to go ahead while he fights the Set Animal. To annoy it, Carter names it
   Leroy
   . The Set Animal attacks and Carter is bitten, but turns into a falcon-headed avatar again. He underestimates the Set Animal's weight and gets knocked over. Despite being disadvantaged, Carter manages to push the Set Animal into his Duat locker. He reaches Bast and Sadie just in time and Bast heals Carter's arm.

   On the plane, Carter dreams of someplace in Arizona. He zooms in and sees a giant pyramid the color of blood-red under construction with hordes of demons as the builders. Carter recognizes the way they're being built is the same technique as the Giza pyramids were built, but this one was going at a surprising rate. He sees Set and a demon,
   Face of Horror
   , discussing the construction of the pyramid. Set demanded the pyramid be completed by dawn of his birthday. Carter could also somehow feel his dad's presence and Set said things like the final tomb of Orisis and using Amos Kane.

  <p key="6ac2dc7b-b8db-4700-aa7c-551dec3d7c43">
   Carter wakes up on the plane to find Sadie back in human form. Carter tells them about his dream and Bast says that if the pyramid is set to be finished by the dawn of his birthday, it would give Set a lot of power. Also, Set has managed to enslave other gods, and using the power of those gods, he could create a lot of chaos. They land in Memphis and rent a convertible. Bast says that she won't be going since Thoth and her don't get along well, but she says that Thoth would be somewhere near a place of learning. Sadie suggests the
   University of Memphis
   , so they drive off to there.
  </p>
  <p key="9d858201-2647-411a-b0b5-3dac55c82e2f">
   At the University, they meet Khufu there who tells them that he swam back to Brooklyn House, but went to Thoth after they didn't come back for a day as all
   baboons
   are under his protection. Khufu insists that Carter play with them to show his basketball skills. Carter played really bad, and later gave up to go see Thoth. They meet Thoth and he tells them that he has discovered that Memphis, Tennessee is not Memphis, Egypt. They ask Thoth for help and Thoth tells them that Isis is power-hungry and before, and that Thoth helped them defeat Set before. He said that he wanted to mediate peace, but Isis convinced him not to. He said he even gave Horus an eye of moonlight when his eye got poked out, and healed Isis when Horus decapitated her. He also believed that Isis and Horus had fully possessed their hosts, but thought otherwise when Sadie told Isis to shut up. Thoth explains the tale when Isis dethroned Ra by poisoning him through a snake made from Ra's spit. She forced Ra to give her his secret name in order to heal him, so Ra did, but Isis banished him and let her husband, Orisis, become king. Since Set was Ra's strongest lieutenant, he hated Orisis for that, and that was how the rivalry began.

   Thoth gives them a test to get an item of power, so he could help them. He transported them to
   Graceland
   , the home of Elvis Presley. Carter noted that there weren't any guards or tourists, but they guessed Thoth drove them away. They walk towards the building and see two magicians with staffs and wands coming towards them. They quickly go into the house to hide, but the magicians have gotten near. They go into the 'Jungle Room', a room Elvis decorated to annoy his dad, when Carter tells Sadie to go look for it while he fights them off. He summons his combat avatar, but one of the magicians blasts him into a lizard. Sadie takes him and goes into Elvis's trophy room to look for it. There, she summons four Elvis suits to go attack the two magicians. The magicians fight them off, but Sadie still hasn't found the items yet. They find her, and the one that turned Carter into a lizard tried the same trick on her. She deflects it, but the magician turns his staff into a komodo dragon. Sadie defeats it with Isis's help, and knocks that magician out. The other magician knocks her staff out with air magic. She uses her rope and uses the

   Egyptian Queen

   Bloodstained Blade
   , which was their captain. They order him to sail into the Land of the Dead, and Bast tells them that this is the boat that she and their father discussed a deal after he and his wife released him. The Kanes ask Bast if she was fighting Apophis before in her prison. Bast says that she was the
   Eye of Ra
   , and that he ordered her to fight Apophis in there. She was proud to do so for centuries and even millennia, but she realized that Ra planned for them to fight away until both faded from existence. She realized that she was losing the fight and Ruby Kane saw that, so they released her, but sealed Apophis in there. Bast and Julius both thought that it was enough to keep Apophis contained, but over the years, they doubted that.

   Carter then drifted off into sleep and Horus showed him a scene where Zia, Desjardins, and a couple other magicians were on a plane. The plane was being attacked by Set, and breaking apart. They quickly repaired the airplane and landed. Another scene showed Isis finding the coffin in which Orisis's body was in. Then Set appeared and shattered the coffin along with the body of Orisis. Isis and Horus had to flee again while Set chased them. Horus told Carter that even after finding all the pieces, Isis's magic wasn't strong enough, so Orisis became an undead god where he could only rule over the dead. Then Sadie woke him up and told him they had arrived in the land of the dead.

   They navigate the river, and Bloodstained Blade said that this is very delicate work, and was using the
   The Book of the Dead

She said that before Ra would travel through the river each night and get renewed in the morning. But not Ra retired to the heavens and when he is too tired to live, Apophis will rise and consume the world in Chaos.

   of Iskandar who froze the time for everyone except Sadie and he explains that he was mad when Cleopatra lost Egypt to the Ptolemaic rulers, and blamed it on the way of the gods. He discussed it with Thoth and they agreed that the path of the gods was too dangerous. After two thousand years, Sadie's mother convinced him that the path of the gods must be learned and used again as a new threat rises. He says that he is the gatekeeper and is supposed to asses if Sadie had courage or not, in which he said she had a lot of, so he let them pass. Sadie unfroze her friends and explained everything.

   They then sail onto land where the Egyptian Queen drops them off and are approached by a jackal which Sadie found cute. Then the jackal turned into the god Anubis whom Sadie found 'drop-dead gorgeous'. They asked Anubis for help against Set, but Anubis refused but decided not to kill them as they traveled with a baboon. Anubis led them into the
   Hall of Judgement
   where the scales used to weigh the dead are broken. Anubis said that Orisis had gone off too long and he shows the

   Feather of Truth
   , but after learning that giving it to Sadie can help them release Orisis and return him to the Land of the Dead, he gave it to her, but asked her to answer three questions first. He warned her that telling a lie while holding it would make her combust into flames. After passing all three questions, Anubis let Sadie with the Feather of Truth and go back to where Carter was. He advises to ask Nephthys what Set's secret name is.

   Bast a RV and started driving towards Phoenix. Carter noticed that Sadie was behaving weirdly, and went outside to practice his swordplay. After an hour, he sat down and an image of Horus appeared next to him warning of an enemy that would come to them before Set, an enemy that has tried to kill Horus before. Then the image is replaced by that of Zia. Zia warns him not to follow the path of the gods and try to listen to Desjardins. Carter refuses, so Zia says that Desjardins split them into two groups of two, and she could try to let her teammate not attack them. Her image became blurry, so she warned Carter not to trust Amos. Zia's image disappear as they stop.

   They approach a river as they believe that is the best way to find Set's secret name. Carter and Khufu sense something lurking in the weeds, but reluctantly let Sadie try to communicate with Nephthys. She communicated, but the voice was weak and spoke of being trapped in a 'sleeping host'. Carter then spots a giant crocodile attacking a family. Carter hears Bast cry out and see that the crocodile hat hit her in the head and that she passed out. Enraged, Carter easily defeats the crocodile, but the the god

   Sadie wakes in New Mexico with Carter and Amos next to her. Amos explains that Set doesn't need a host as long as the pyramid is there to manifest in a physical form. Amos said that Set placed a spell on Amos, so Amos was frozen. The magic eventually wore off, so he gathered his energy and burst free when the demons were sleeping. Since it was easy for Amos to get out, he believed he was let out on purpose. Sadie falls asleep again and meets Geb, the earth god. Sadie gives Geb the envelope which showed Geb Nut's face for the first time in millennia. Geb advised Sadie to the place of the crosses, and then Sadie woke up. She wakes up and Carter thinks they should go to
   Las Cruces

Sadie and Carter are both suspicious of Amos since he was supposedly let out by Set and wouldn't tell him anything about how they plan to defeat Set. They hop on Amos's magic boat and drive off to there.

Amos and Desjardins engage in a duel while Amos uses storm magic, which is Amos has never used before and is a force of chaos. Zia sides with the Kanes and summons a pillar of fire that goes after Desjardins. It is revealed to be the most impressive feat a fire elementalist can perform and will hunt down its target for 6-12 hours. The downside is that Zia will be unconscious until the pillar wears out. While Desjardins is retreating, he summons seven arrows and throws them at Amos, summoning

She tells them about before when Ra sent Sekhmet to destroy the wicked people of Egypt, she went out of control and started killing the good people too. They knew she wouldn't stop until she was full of blood, so the magicians tricked her by giving her a large bowl of red liquid. She drank until she was full and fell asleep. Ra recalled her and turned her into a cow to make the goddess

Carter uses Doughboy, and after chanting the words Zia instructs him, the coat turns to life and starts driving them. On the car, Zia tells Carter that she knows Set's secret name. Carter inquires how and thinks that Zia might've hosted Nephthys as she was there when the Rosetta Stone broke. She disagrees as the other magicians hadn't detected it yet.

She says that unless Sadie stops Set, this will happen and that once Set is defeated, they have to put Horus back on the throne. Sadie wakes up to Zia poking her and learned that the city is being evacuated and using magic is getting harder. She also says the GPS is down and Carter and Amos went to ask for directions. Zia believes that Amos still cannot be trusted, but Sadie disagrees to that. Then Amos comes back saying that they're really close to the pyramid. As they approach, they realize they need to hide and that going in the truck is too dangerous. Amos turns them all into black dust to hide them despite their protests. They get closer to the pyramids and revert to human form. They see Set's forces putting the final piece on the pyramid, the golden pyramidion. They discuss how to get inside the pyramid without being spotted, so they decide for Carter and Sadie to turn into birds, Zia using her vulture pendant, and Amos going his own way.

   They arrive at the boat and take out the demons there with Amos reverting back from a fruit bat. This causes the pyramidion to drop, thus preventing the pyramid from full completion. Then forty to fifty winged demons attack and Amos holds them off while the rest of them sneaks in. Carter closes and then seals the door with the Eye of Horus symbol. They venture in and Carter and Zia notice that the tomb drawings are not that of a proper tomb and Zia explains it is to create more chaos. They reach the throne room at the center and see the coffin where Orisis/Julius Kane lay. Then Amos jumps from the ceiling and says that he had defeated the demons for a while. While Carter and Sadie ask how to release their dad, but then Amos falls to his knees and smoke starts coming out of him. The smoke then manifested into Set.

   Set laughed as he said that now all other of his four siblings were here. He implied that Zia hosted Nephthys, but Carter believed that nothing Zia emitted was godly, so he disagreed with Set. After being slammed and pinned by Set, he and Horus decided to stop fighting and act as one as they had a common enemy. They summoned the combat avatar and attacked Set in unison. Carter/Horus and Set traded blows and destroyed their surroundings, but Carter realized that it would crush Sadie, Zia, and Amos, so he imagined Set as a fruit bat and turned him into one. He himself turned into a falcon and took Set out of the pyramid. Set turned back into human and showed Carter the House of Life fighting their way through Set's forces, but his demons were too much and they were being beaten. Then Carter saw the pyramidion being carried up by four serpent-headed giants. Then Set struck him with the

Sadie touched the coffin anyways and saw she was at the Hall of Judgement and Anubis was there. He told her that she shouldn't be there and that the restoration of Ma'at must start there. Then she was at the throne of the gods and saw Bast there. Bast told Sadie that if Set won't take control, who will? Sadie was then transported to the First Nome where Iskandar was kneeling by the empty throne of the pharaoh. Iskandar told her that someone must become the pharaoh to which Sadie replied it can't be Carter. Iskandar said that the fate will depend on the entire Kane family. The scene then changed to her parents at Cleopatra's Needle to where they were about to release Bast from her prison. Sadie let go of the coffin and started to blame Isis for what happened. Then her father's spirit came from the coffin and told her not to blame Isis and that if she merged with a god, she might've burned up. He then told her not to release him first and defeat Set since the power of the pyramid would've consumed Orisis's spirit and hasten the process of destruction. Sadie then merged with Isis like Carter had done and flew to the top of the pyramid.

   Carter saw Desjardins fly out of the crowd and knock the demons carrying the pyramidion out, and tried to destroy it. Unfortunately, Set whacked Desjardins down the pyramid before he could destroy the pyramidion. Carter rose again and fought Set once more, but Set struck his staff against Carter's ankle and sent Carter down the side of the pyramid again. He picked up the capstone and headed for the top, but then Sadie appeared. She summoned a giant portal that transported everyone hovering over the Washington Monument, and damaged parts of the pyramid. Doing this rid the pyramid of its energy source, the desert. Sadie summoned the Feather of Truth and started chanting. Set tried to interrupt her, but Carter held him back. Sadie was a line away from finishing the spell, but she heard her mother warn her to 'watch for the enemy'. She looked at the pyramid and saw a giant snake there. She stopped the spell and then Set's assistant, Face of Horror, tried to kill Sadie. Carter threw his sword and killed him. The snake's body flew up to the sky, and both Sadie and Carter realized that it was Apophis. Apophis said that he was now breaking free from his weakened prison. Using Set's secret name, Sadie forced him to swear to side with them against Apophis, and Set agreed.
