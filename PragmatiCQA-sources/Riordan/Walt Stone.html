   Walt comes from a family descended from Akhenaton. Due to Akhenaton's wish to destroy the worship of the gods, priests
   cursed
   Akhenaton and his offspring, which is why the pharaoh Tutankhamen (his son), and later descendants died at an early age. Practicing magic tends to speed up the curse, so Walt uses amulets, which store magic in advance.

   He then decided to go to the Brooklyn house and learn magic. He then learned that if he used amulets and hosted a god he would live longer. So he learned how to use the amulets, and then hosted Anubis. He did not want to tell Sadie for a while and then, later on, she realizes that he was hosting Anubis.

   Walt is seen in the beginning stealing the Khnum artifact from the Brooklyn Museum. He and Jaz were caught holding hands, and Sadie misinterprets this. Later, he is with Carter in his room after breakfast, and run off to save Sadie in London. He is then kicked out by Bes, who knows what Walt was dealing with. He comes in afterward when he and Sadie look for the third scroll. In the end, Walt and Zia transported home while Sadie and Carter went through the Duat. The Kanes' original plan had been to interrogate Menshikov (as he was descended from the priests who cursed Akhenaton) while he was trapped, but Vlad's price was to side with Chaos. The plan failed as Vlad died, and Sadie felt guilty, much to the disappointment of Walt.

Sadie succeeds in restoring Bes and Walt dies, but comes back to life moments later and warns Sadie that Setne has betrayed them and she must save Carter, creating a portal to his and Zia's location. Walt tells Sadie he'll meet her at the First Nome at sunrise if she doesn't hate him for what he did as he's still too weak to come now. When she doesn't understand, he tells her to look deeper and she does and finally understands how he is still alive and what he had been planning with Anubis: Walt is now the host of Anubis and the eye of the god. His power to turn things to dust had come from following the god's path and the two had been planning this so they could both be with Sadie and Walt could survive.

   Sadie notes that he seems to have a 'gravity' about him that allows him to command attention when required. He always thinks carefully before acting, and Carter describes his personality as "Sadie's exact opposite". He also has a crush on Sadie. Although he is dying of a curse, he is sacrificial and does all he can to protect his friends. Walt seems to be a little shy and timid when he is near Sadie. However, he is willing to do anything for her and becomes the host to Anubis to live and to allow both of them to be with her, telling Anubis when he agrees "I can't leave her." Afterwards, he becomes very protective of Sadie, informing his enemies that he won't allow anyone to hurt her with the sentiment coming from both himself

   Walt and Sadie had a close relationship since they worked together. Walt is in love with Sadie, and wants to spend as much time with her before he dies due to the curse his family passed on to him. When both of them were finding the third scroll, Walt said good job and kissed her (Sadie claims "probably out of happiness or excitement"). Walt went to protect Brooklyn house with Zia and it scared Sadie that she may never see Walt again. Throughout the third book, their feelings for each other intensify.

   Despite the fact that both Walt and Anubis like Sadie, and the slight rivalry between the two, Anubis gives Walt advice on how to deal with his illness, and also tells him not to despair and he will ease his pain as much as he could, much to Sadie's surprise. Walt also mentions that he could feel the presence of Anubis around him, thinking he may be one of Anubis' chosen. But Walt feels that Sadie will choose Anubis over him, due to the fact that he may not live more than a year. In the third book, Walt and Anubis begin to hang around each other and the others just thought Anubis was preparing Walt for death. However, it is revealed that Walt has been channeling Anubis' power and has chosen the Path of Anubis. When Walt is near death, Anubis appears, asking him about a choice he has to make as it's his last chance and Walt says yes, as he can't leave Sadie, a sentiment Anubis agrees to. Shortly afterwards, their plan and Walt's choice are revealed as when Walt dies, he is revived seconds later because he become Anubis' first human host. At the end of the book when all the gods retreat to the heavens Walt/Anubis is allowed to stay on earth and begin a normal life (well as normal as life in

   had been made wrong, it could've summoned or even strengthened Apophis, but Carter trusted Walt to perform the difficult task. Carter also relies on Walt with the trainees and describes him as his "unofficial lieutenant." When Walt revealed he was dying soon, Carter displayed a similar level of distress to Sadie over the fact and tried desperately to think of something to save him. Walt nearly told Carter his plans with Anubis before he told Sadie, but only ended up hinting at them after they learned that Sadie was calling for them. Carter also shows no issue with the idea of Walt dating his sister, being willing to trust Walt with her.

   Jaz and Walt share a very close friendship in the beginning of The Throne of Fire, as she was trying to help him find a cure for his curse. Jaz is also probably the first person he'd told about his curse, and she often encourages him. However, this marked a wrong impression on Sadie, who thought they had feelings for each other and got jealous. Before facing the bau, Jaz kissed him on the cheek and assured him about himself. When Jaz fell into a coma, Walt showed concern, being the person to carry her on the way to Brooklyn House. After she woke up, at the end of
