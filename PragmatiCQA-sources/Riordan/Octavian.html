After they agree to give the "Greeks" peace, Octavian walks out of the senate in disgust.

   Octavian was an arrogant, jingoistic, condescending, machiavellian individual. Much like the Roman ideal, he was ambitious and followed the rules, at least on the surface.  Unfortunately for any one who crossed him, Octavian was highly intelligent, callous, cunning, and manipulative. Octavian was deeply knowledgeable of Roman history, including the fact that the Greek demigods were once enemies of the Roman ones. At times, he is portrayed as a potential threat if one became enemies with him. Percy Jackson, however, is unimpressed by him.
  </p>
  <p key="433ce35a-7345-449b-b921-c4e6dab5eb9d">
   Octavian seemed to want to protect Camp Jupiter and its legionaries. His plan of attack against the Greek camp notably involved no Roman demigod casulties. Octavian was willing to delay the attack in order for this specific plan to be used. Octavian demands respect towards his people's rules, traditions, and culture, though he is seen to be willing to adjust to new methods (such as using stuffed animals instead of real ones in his auguries). While Octavian has the same general bias against Greek demigods that the rest of the legion has, Octavian grows increasingly hostile towards them over the course of the books.

     Will Solace
    </a>
    , despite them both being a descendant of Apollo and describes the former as looking like a watered-down, unhealthy version of Will, without anything in him that makes a child of Apollo special. Octavian, on the other hand, seems to have finally come to appreciate what a powerful ally Nico could potentially be for him, as he claims to see a decent amount of ruthlessness in the son of Hades, which he also greatly appreciates. Hence, Octavian promptly attempts to sway the son of Hades to his side, arguing that the Greeks hadn't ever actually done anything for the former. Octavian claims that he can beat any offer the Greeks might have given Nico, and assures him a place in

    in return for Nico siding with him and allowing the Romans to win. Nico, however, doesn't even consider the offer, declines right away, and promptly tells all of the assembled demigods to listen to what

    has to say, just as she arrives with the

    in tow. Nico is later present when Octavian intends to shoot an onager at

    , and clearly sees that doing so will result in Octavian's death. However, it is at that moment that Nico recalls what his father

    had told him, about some deaths that cannot and should not be prevented, and Nico needing to act when the time comes. Hence, for the first time, Nico decides to trust the wisdom of his father, and stops

    (who stares at him in disbelief) from trying to prevent Octavian's plan, and subsequently witnesses the augur's horrific fiery demise, along with the death of

    and destruction of Gaea. While Nico isn't at all saddened by Octavian's death, he is very guilt-ridden, since Nico feels that him choosing not to prevent Octavian's death unnecessarily cost Leo his life, something that he is unable to forgive himself for. Nico is also horrified of Will now possibly thinking of him as a monster for letting Octavian die, but is extremely relieved to learn of that not being the case.
