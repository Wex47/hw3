The two then gave each other a look, showing that they were planning something. After Meg was welcomed by Chiron, Connor agreed with Sherman that they should give her a warm welcome in the canoe lake. He got a golden net and threw it over Meg's head and tried to dunk her, but

   The next day, Connor was paired with
   Paolo Montes
   for the three legged death race, with neither being happy about it. He looked glum either because he missed Travis or his hair was covered in medicinal salve. Connor became even more annoyed when Paolo started complaining loudly in Portuguese, making Connor cover his left ear. However, the two collaborated well and found a golden apple minutes into the race. Connor grinned at Apollo and Meg and taunted them, but Connor realized they were about to be pummeled by iron orbs from the ceiling, and screamed to run. They ran away awkwardly.

Like most of the other children of Hermes, he has elfish features, upturned eyebrows, a sarcastic smile and a gleam in his eyes, like he was ready to "drop a firecracker down your shirt". He has a crooked smile to match his personality and crooked sense of humor. He is also a little bit shorter than his brother, Travis, which is the only way people can tell them apart.

In Dutch versions the last name of the Stolls is Stall; you can derive this from the past tense of "stelen": the Dutch verb of to steal, or from stall: stable, since Hermes is also the god of animals. This last one is also the irony Percy commented on in the Dutch versions. In the Hebrew version of the book, his last name is שוד (Shod), which is the Hebrew word for robbery.
