    Lately, seventh grader Nizhoni Begay has been able to detect monsters, like that man in the fancy suit who was in the bleachers at her basketball game. Turns out he's Mr. Charles, her dad's new boss at the oil and gas company, and he's alarmingly interested in Nizhoni and her brother, Mac, their Navajo heritage, and the legend of the Hero Twins. Nizhoni knows he’s a threat, but her father won't believe her. When Dad disappears the next day, leaving behind a message that says "Run!", the siblings and Nizhoni's best friend, Davery, are thrust into a rescue mission that can only be accomplished with the help of Diné Holy People, all disguised as quirky characters. Their aid will come at a price: the kids must pass a series of trials in which it seems like nature itself is out to kill them. If Nizhoni, Mac, and Davery can reach the House of the Sun, they will be outfitted with what they need to defeat the ancient monsters Mr. Charles has unleashed. But it will take more than weapons for Nizhoni to become the hero she was destined to be . . . Timeless themes such as the importance of family and respect for the land resonate in this funny, fast-paced, and exciting quest adventure set in the American Southwest.

   is a seventh-grade girl that can see monsters. She had transferred from a public school to
   Intertribal Community Charter School

   Right now, she was playing in a basketball game on the team of the Isotopes against the Beavers. However, she noticed one of the spectators was wearing a suit as opposed to everyone else, so Nizhoni suspected him to be a monster as they often disguised themselves as humans, she'd seen it twice before. Coach told Nizhoni to focus on her, she was a little short probably due to being a descendant of the Hopi tribe. A timeout was called with five seconds of the game left, confident Nizhoni offered to take the last shot when

   However, Nizhoni noticed the man in the suit moving about and as soon as she spotted him again, she screamed and got hit between the eyes with the basketball Davery threw. This resulted in the Isotopes losing the game, Coach gave Nizhoni an ice pack as she was bleeding. Coach failed to call Mr. Begay, he's always busy unlike Davery's parents, Nizhoni was now banned from the gym. She really wanted to have school fame, she was thinking about lacrosse but the Haudenosaunee girls wouldn't take kindly to her. Nizhoni hasn't seen her mother since she was a toddler, the only thing she has left of her was a pendant she kept under her shirt with a picture of her family inside. She decided not to tell Davery about the man, they left for froyo and soda pop, but not before Nizhoni saw the man in the suit staring at her.

He turns his attention to her and explains why he's really in Albuquerque. He explains that her maternal lineage is interesting to him and that through that lineage she is descended from Changing Woman. He explains that he knows of her abilities and sensed them at the game, he states that he has spent a long time building up power and he was foretold a descendant of the Hero Twins, the Changing Woman's sons, would undo his plans. He pulls out a knife and states that he sensed something dormant in Mac and plans to kill her and take her brother to use his abilities. Nizhoni, who has been trembling in fear, becomes enraged and attacks Mr. Charles. She disarms and attacks Mr. Charles, before the others come in. Her father stares at her in a mix of anger and horror and helps up and apologizes to his potential new boss. He scolds Nizhoni for attacking him and Mr. Charles, who acts like it is nothing, makes up a story of him going inside to use the bathroom, that he was admiring the family picture, and that Nizhoni asked for an autograph. She states he has a knife but

He asks her why she attacked Mr. Charles and she tells him what he told her, but her father still does not believe her. He then tells her that her mother was creative and claimed to see monsters, this shocks Nizhoni and she asks him to tell her more about it but he ignores her, gives his daughter her phone back, and leaves her room, taking her leftovers with him.

Nizhoni explains that he is only trying to see what Mac's powers are, but she does not press further and Mac leaves as they pass his school. When she reaches ICCS she finds Davery in the library and tells him she can see monsters, he believes her and they head the computers to find out more.

They look up the name Mr. Yazzie told her and find the name "Spider Woman". Just then the bell rings and students start to swarm the library. To get more information, Davery suggests she join the Ancestor Club, that he founded and is president of, to learn more and she accepts.

Nizhoni hides behind her neighbor's bush and overhears him telling the others about his plan to use Mr. Begay as bait to lure his children into their trap and drive off with her narrowly avoiding being seen. Nizhoni goes inside to find everything in order and goes to her room to talk with Mr. Yazzie, but he remains silent and she puts him in her backpack. She gets her lunch and finds an apple next to the bag with "run" carved into it. Soon Mr. Charles returns to get the photo, but Nizhoni takes it and runs back to school. Nizhoni runs into the library and pulls Davery aside to tell him everything when she mentions she left the apple behind Davery thinks Mr. Charles will come for her now that she knows.

As Adrien insults the siblings and snaps one of Mac's colored pencils, Mac snaps and slams his hand on the ground, causing Adrien and his friends to be attacked by the sprinklers as they run back to the school building. Mac calms down and realizes what he did. He states that he made the water in the bathtub move a few times in the past, but thought he was only imagining it. Nizhoni tells him Mr. Charles has their father and he told them to run. She says she has train tickets for them to get to Gallup and find someone who can help them. She says Mr. Charles wants to use him to help with his fracking and kill her. As they get up, Davery texts her to warn her school secretary is looking for her.

Nizhoni wonders where Davery is as the train starts to move and sees him jump on the train as he is being chased by Cuttlebush, who Nizhoni realizes is a monster in disguise. Davery makes his way to the Begay siblings and tells them he ran into Cuttlebush at the bus stop and he tried to ask him where he and the Begays were going.

Once the lizard warms up he takes the group back to his hogan to warm up where he introduces himself as

Rock Crystal Boy says he will point them in the right direction and when they finish their tea, he takes them to a pile of shells. After taking a moment to realize the size of the pile, the four search for the perfect white shell. Mac, Davery, and Mr. Yazzie climb the pile with ease, but Nizhoni struggles. She then focuses on finding the shell, visualizing it in her head and it appears in her hand. As she calls the others down in triumph, she realizes half a day has passed. Soon a giant bird lands by them and Mr. Yazzie introduces her as
   Łizhin

   Black Jet Girl

Łizhin says Nizhoni must come with her the the northernmost mountain and she calls the heralds of Tsoodzil and Dook'o'oosłiid to take Mac and Davery respectively to the mountains to find the offerings.

   Nizhoni wakes up in the morning to find herself alone on the mountain. She panics and finds Black Jet Girl and Łizhin walking out of a nearby cluster of trees. The herald, who shrank herself down to the size of a crow, grows to her normal size and tells Nizhoni they will be at
   Canyon de Chelly
   shortly. Black Jet Girl gives Nizhoni a peace of jet from her earring and hopes to see her again. As they fly off Łizhin tells Nizhoni their has been an accident.

   She meets up with Mac and Davery, the later has the abalone shell from the shoulder of Dook'o'oosłiid’s guardian Abalone Shell Boy while the former is moping and causing the current of the nearby river to speed up. Mr. Yazzie explains they had trouble find Turquoise Boy and when they did a storm arrived. As Dólii turned, Mr. Yazzie lost his grip and Mac, holding the turquoise in one hand, had to drop it to save Mr. Yazzie. The blue herald and horned toad tell the boy not to blame himself and Nizhoni offers her necklace as compensation. When Mac calms down they fly to Spider Woman.

   The three come across a trailer with a lawn and a truck. They hear a television from inside and Nizhoni knocks on the door. A woman answers and asks if they want to buy a rug. They enter and, after a brief moment of hesitation, tell her they are their for her map of the glistening world. They give her the gifts and her mother's necklace and
   Spider Woman
   reveals she met with her mother in the past and that she does not have the map. They are upset and ask how are they supposed to get the
   Glittering World
   . Spider Woman tells them they are already in the Glittering World and take them outside to prove it. They find the world to be mesmerizing and Spider Woman tells them she will take them to the rainbow road in the morning, due to the passage being to dangerous during the night, where they will take part in four trials. When they go inside Nizhoni sees a blanket that Spider Woman says her mother liked, who visited her ten years ago. They make dinner and the three get ready for bed As they drift off to sleep, Nizhoni tells Mac their father been taken by
   Mr. Charles
   , but he is fine. Davery tells Nizhoni he thinks the line about them have four days to find they are not alone means they are backed by the Holy People. As she drifts to sleep she thinks that the reason her mother never came back is because she died.

   Spider Woman wakes them up before sunrise and walks them to the rainbow road in the rain, they leave a sleeping Mr. Yazzie behind. When they arrive the three do not see it at first, but after a second they see it. Spider Woman wishes them luck and leaves them to complete the trials. They look at the song lyrics and find a line describing the trials. As they set off, Nizhoni walks off a cliff. She lands in a puddle of mud in a canyon and the boys slide down after her. They look up to find the rainbow road has vanished and the wind from some nearby rocks sounds like it’s calling them. Mac wishes Mr. Yazzie was with them and the horned toad suddenly appears, he runs over to him but Nizhoni realizes it's a fake but warns her brother to late. Mac vanishes into the rocks and the canyon closes in on Nizhoni and Davery. Nizhoni thinks quick and breaks a branch off of a nearby tree and sticks it between the rocks, it works at first before snapping under the pressure. As the walls close in around them they jump into a cave where the walls continue to close in. Despite being dark, Nizhoni can see almost clearly runs at a high speed. She finds Mac crying and tries to comfort him and get him to move, however he is revealed to be a monster who attacks her, but she fights back. The false Mac changes into Mr. Yazzie and then a cockroach before scurrying away. When Davery arrives she tells him Mr. Charles has Mac before he pulls her along.

   They exit the cave just as the walls close in and find the rainbow road. As Nizhoni mourns the lose of Mac, Davery reassures her that he will be okay due to his ancestral powers and that if Mr. Charles has him, then he is with their dad. They move on to the next trial, a field of knives, as they wade through  the marsh and reeds, they notice the reeds are getting sharper and realize the reeds are the knives. Nizhoni covers herself in mud to protect herself and has Davery do the same. However it starts to rain and they make it out cover in cuts and scratches. After checking the song again for the next trial, a prom of thorns, they hear music and see the rainbow road leading them to what looks like a school gym. They go over and enter the gym to find dozens of teenagers in formal wear at a dance. At first they try to get out as quickly as they can  with out talking to anyone or drinking eating anything. However they soon give in and have snacks, punch, and dance with the party goers. However as time goes on they forget why they came their until a song jogs Nizhoni's memories and she drags Davery away. The prom goers try to stop them but Nizhoni pulls the fire alarm and they escape the building just as it vanishes behind them. They notice that several hours have passed and Nizhoni worries they will fail is they don't make it to the last trial, but Davery says the last trial has come to them.

  <p key="1ed5933a-589d-4dbf-8683-f3f153668208">
   They turn around to find a field of assorted mirrors. Davery theorizes that, before the prom when Nizhoni wished for no more nature trials and they went to a dance, that the trials react differently to those who take them. As they look into the mirrors Nizhoni sees a woman in her thirties with jeans and a leather jacket in her reflection with her. After fishing out the family picture, she realizes the woman is her mother. Nizhoni gets pulled into the mirror and sees a memory of her mother and herself at age two on a snowy mountain. Her mother unwraps her from her blankets and gent flips her in the snow before bundling her up again. Nizhoni’s mother tells her she must be brave and strong as she won't be around much longer. She hears a sound and hurries back to the house. She closes the door and her husband calls out to her. She kisses Nizhoni one last time before taking out a bow and leaving her daughter behind so she can fight the monster. Her father finds her and picks her up, not hearing his wife fighting outside. Nizhoni then leaves the memory and Davery comes over to her, who tells her she vanished for a minute. When she realizes she is out of the memory she smashes the mirror and blames her mother for choosing fighting monsters over her family and she is probably dead. Davery tells her her mother probably had no choice but to fight the monster for her family's sake. When Nizhoni calms down they walk over to another mirror and close their eyes before looking in it, but when Nizhoni opens her eyes Davery is gone. Nizhoni searches frantically for her friend but finds nothing of Davery. She curls up into a ball and cries. Soon a doe walks up to her and stop a few feet away, wondering if this is a holy person or not she decides to talk to the deer.  After a one sided conversation she chooses to keep going for the sake of her family and Davery.

   When Nizhoni reaches the house of the sun, she is stopped by a pair of bear statues outside who ask her to state who she is and take a number. When she does they say
   Jóhonaa'éí
   is busily and to turn around. After a brief argument with the statue she mentions the
   <a href="Binaa yee aghani.html" key="764a1d63-b885-4bd3-87e6-f8b4a502a78c" title="Bináá' yee aghání">

   and they quickly take her to the holy person. As they walk one of the statues mentions her friend is already their and she is confused until she sees
   Mr. Yazzie
   and happily greets him. She then comes face to face with Jóhonaa'éí and says she has completed her trials. He asks her to prove it and she describes each trial, what she learned from each of them, and what happened to her companions. When he asks Nizhoni is she thinks she is a monster slayer, she says yes. Jóhonaa'éí accepts this response and takes Nizhoni to get her weapon. Before they leave she tells Mr. Yazzie about Mac and Davery and the horned toad gives his condolences, but Jóhonaa'éí informs her sacrifices has to be made and that if they were lost on the rainbow road they are probably in the lost and found. Nizhoni asks to see them but the others say she must ready to fight Mr. Charles. She keeps insisting and they agree to take her to them after she gets her weapon.

  <p key="e2611f07-2f85-42d1-ae4a-f349f3e5453d">
   They head to the weapons room and find lightning coming from the ceiling. Jóhonaa'éí tells her he uses the lighting to create weapons. He asks her what weapons she and her friends need and when she tells him of their abilities he creates the ideal weapons. He makes a book on how to defeat enemies for Davery, a bottle of liquid lightning for Mac, and a bow and four arrows for Nizhoni. Mr. Yazzie complains about most of the weapons and pulls Nizhoni out of the forge as Jóhonaa'éí creates one last weapon. When they reach the lost and found she does not find Mac and Davery, but rather her mother. She walks in and sees her mother and other heroes from different ages, along with Mac and Davery, encased in amber. Mr. Yazzie tells her they are their because they failed the trials. Jóhonaa'éí enters and says that she has a choice, to go out and achieve glory on her own, or step aside and let others perform the task for her. Nizhoni chooses the latter and the others are freed. She hugs Mac and Davery and introduces them to Bethany. Bethany hugs her son while her daughter is more restrained. She apologizes to Nizhoni and explains she went after the monsters so that she wouldn’t have to. Davery interrupts and tells them they have company, they go outside to find the guardians of the sacred mountains and the heralds outside. Black Jet Girl tells Nizhoni that the monsters are freed.

   Shiprock
   . Mac, Davery, and Bethany mount the heralds while the others fight from the ground. As Mac begs Nizhoni to come with them, she says she can't due to giving up the opportunity to free them, however Mr. Yazzie says she can still fight as she had to be willing to stand aside, and they need her due to the amount of monsters. She boards
   Łizhin
   and the four set off.

Dave has not yet found what he needs to defeat the monsters as Nizhoni is attacked by two of the buzzards, she takes one out and Mac takes out the other. Dólii is slammed by a Bináá' yee agháni and Mac is thrown off and plummets to the ground. However he is wrapped in webbing and
   Spider Woman
   reveals herself. She points up and Nizhoni sees the biggest Bináá' yee agháni she has ever seen being controlled by
   Mr. Charles
   . As he goes from Mac Łizhin tries to intervene by two more buzzards controlled by
   Mr. Rock
   and
   Ms. Bird
   block them and injure Łizhin’s wing. Davery comes over to her and tells Nizhoni that she has to jump to defeat Mr. Charles. Nizhoni steels herself for the jump and leeps off the black mountain herald. She lands on
   Łigai
   and helps her mother with the blockade. She shoots the buzzard with Ms. Bird on it and she plummets to the ground below while he mother slices off Mr. Rock's hand as she takes aim with his gun. Bethany jumps off the white herald and lands on the yellow herald. Nizhoni sees Mr. Charles cutting Mac free. She fires her last arrow at him, but he catches it and sends it back at her. Hitting her in the chest and sending her plummeting to the ground.

   Nizhoni wakes up on the ground with Mr. Charles standing over her. He taunts the girl as a warm sensation builds up in her body. He says she is alone and he will soon have Mac working for him in Oklahoma, like the others with ancestral powers he has collected over the years. He tells Nizhoni she is alone but she says he is wrong, she has her friend, family, guardians, heralds, and ancestors on her side. Mr. Charles keeps taunting her until she mentions she has the lightning on her side and blasts him with a bolt, blowing him up.

When they realize Mac is no where to be found, Spider Woman walks over to him and they embrace the boy. When they talk about finding their dad, Spider Woman reveals she found him tied up in an SUV on the other side of the mountain. He walks out from behind the holy person and apologizes to his children for not believing them. When he sees his wife, he walks over to Bethany and the two kiss. Seconds later an old fashioned green pickup truck drives around the corner and Nizhoni's grandmother emerges from the truck. She congratulates the children and welcomes her daughter back and sheds a tear when she hears her brother Eugene has returned. She offers to give them a ride to Spider Woman's trailer and they accept. Her daughter and son-in-law sit with her while the others ride in the bed. As they pull out Davery asks Nizhoni if she is okay with no one at school knowing what she did, and she says yes as the most important people know.
