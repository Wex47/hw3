Angry at him for going, at my parents for letting him, at everyone and everything. Myself most of all, for not making more of every moment we'd shared. But don’t let that anger eat you up, it’ll destroy you.

   stories. He had an older brother named
   Mohammed
   . When the two were younger, they would reenact the

    Epic of Gilgamesh
   </i>
   in
   Central Park
   . Mo would be Gilgamesh which he would be Gilgamesh's sidekick Enkidu. The pair even went trick or treating as the hero and sidekick for Halloween when he was five.

   Sikander says he has a zit and he rushes to the bathroom. When he is alone he has a conversation with a memorial wall his parents set up after Mo's death while he wipes down the tables. He hears something in the back alley and he grabs a wok and goes to investigate. After seeing a white-eyed tabby cat, he sees two
   strange
   looking
   men in the dumpster and over hears them looking for him. He swings the wok at them when he hears they want to kill his family. He locks them in the dumpster and calls for Daoud to call the police. The two reveal they're
   Asakku
   , Mesopotamian demons, as one of them uses his tongue to unlock the lid and they break out, soon a figure starts to form at the end of the ally and they tell him their boss has arrived. When Sik sees the boss, a man made of shadows, he bolts inside. He tries to convince Daoud to help him, but Daoud panics and runs away to call the police. To stop the intruders, he barricades the door with a refrigerator. Flies and cockroaches swarm into the deli, and the shadowy man gets in. He and his demons trash the deli looking for something, tearing Mo's flowers off the walls. He chokes Sik, demanding he tell where it is. Then a girl dressed as a ninja. She demands Nergal to let Sik go. Instead, the shadowy man tells his demons to take care of her. She then proceeds to beat up Nergal's
   Asakku
   , and Nergal decides to release Sik and leave. He collapses from exhaustion as
   Mina
   and
   Mr. Aziz
   barge in to help Sik. When they see he's alright, Mr. Aziz yells at Sik for fighting Nergal, while Mina hugs Sik to make him feel better. Sik watches as Daoud sees the destruction of Mo's flowers. Daoud tries to take a flower out of a broken frame, but it crumbles in his hands.

   Zack
   ,
   Hobbs
   , and
   Clyde
   . As Zack demands Belet's phone, she spin kicks him in the head and knocks him out and Hobbs and Clyde let them pass. As they exit the school, her mother arrives and Sik is captivated by her beauty. The woman introduces herself as
   Ishtar
   . Sik is shocked that he is speaking to someone named after a Mesopotamian goddess  and he mentions what happened to his family's deli last night. She conforms that her brother-in-law was responsible and offers to tell him more, if he comes with her and Belet. Sik is hesitant at first but agrees when Belet says it is his only chance. He and Belet get in the backseat of Ishtar's Jaguar and he is taken to their house.

   When they arrive, Sik is mesmerized by the layout of the mansion. When they enter, he sees many cats and recognizes one from the night before, Belet informs him that his name is
   Sargon
   . As Ishtar tries to find the kitchen, Belet reluctantly shows him around. They get separated and he finds a room full of weapons and armor dating back to the Stone Age. He picks up a sword and cats start to swarm him as he hears a voice telling him to put the sword back. Soon Belet arrives and introduces him in the first sword,
   Kasusu
   . After realizing it was the sword that was talking and he realizes Belet's mother is an actual goddess. He thinks they crazy and goes to leave. However Ishtar stops him and shows him a vision of different wars she was a part of. He collapses in shock as Belet looks him over. Ishtar offers to pay for the damages as they ask him what
   Nergal
   might have been looking for. He becomes angry when they suggest Mo might have smuggled something out of Iraq and refuses to help them. He takes the subway home a when he arrives he sees his parents being put in ambulances. When he tells the paramedics he is their son, they ask how he is feeling and have him put on protective gear and take him with them. As his parents are put on life support and placed in quarantine, Sik is tested for any illnesses but they find nothing wrong with him but is placed under twenty-four hours observation. As he paces around his room, Ishtar and Belet barge in and tell Sik he must come with them if Nergal is to be defeated. He is hesitant about leaving his parents, but they reassure him Nergal will keep them alive as a bargaining chip. He agrees to go with them. He wakes up at Ishtar's house to find Daoud making pancakes. Dauod informs him that his patents are stable but nothing has changed as he reveals the only reason he was working at Mo's is because he promised Mo that he would look after Sik. But before Sik can pry more, Ishtar and Belet arrive and the goddess gets Daoud to leave by saying a modeling agent for France is there to see him. When Daoud leaves, she tells Sik that they must defeat Nergal to save his parents. As she leaves to look for Nergal alone, he and Belet decide to search for Nergal themselves.

   As they travel, he learns that the same sickness that his parents have is going through the school with Zack being hospitalized and the students blaming him. They arrive in a masjid in
   Little Egypt
   in
   Queens
   and meets with his local imam and starts to serve food to the disenfranchised. Soon
   Ada
   , a homeless girl his age with knowledge of bizarre current events in the city, arrives and he serves her food to get her to talk. After she eats, she informs him of a shipping container filled with dead refugees at Gravesend in
   Brooklyn
   . They arrive at the docks and sneak in. They reach the shipping container and inspect it. They find cuneiform etching that reads “Gilgamesh lied” and some couplets by Sidana. Soon they are found by three dockworkers and the pair realize they have been transformed into minions of Nergal. As Belet fights them, he sees one about to hit her with a chain and uses his body to shield her. After taking out the last of the minions, she checks on him and is surprised that he is still alive. She helps him up and they leave. When he tells her the ballet lessons paid off, Belet laughs but quickly catches herself and stops.

   The following morning, Belet wakes Sik up for combat training and is bewildered by his lack of combat training. She leaves to get equipment and he speaks with Kasusu. The sword tells him the feats of Gilgamesh were watered down and that he once rejected Ishtar. Kasusu tells him to fight Sargon, but Sik refuses and cat attacks and overpowers him just as Belet returns with wooden swords. Later he meets up with Daoud and tells him he wants to see his parents. Daoud agrees to get him in and out unnoticed. As they ride the subway, he tries to contact his friends but they don’t reply. Due to massive track shutdowns, they end up walking through
   Washington Square Park
   and see city workers cutting down diseased trees and flowers covered in sludge. When they arrive they find the waiting room packed and set people waiting inline for vaccines. Daoud distracts a nurse while he goes to see his parents. As he watches them
   Idiptu
   arrives with a threatening message, give Nergal what he wants or his parents die. Still not sure about what the Plague God is after, he slams the demon against the wall and says he will stop Nergal.

   When he returns he finds Belet demanding Ishtar tell reveals her plan, she remains tight lipped and asks Sik if Mo took something from Nergal. He becomes defensive and says his brother would never steal anything. Ishtar becomes offended by his tone but Belet calms her down. Later he and Belet move his mattress into her bedroom and she is shocked to learn how small and sparse it is. Belet says she and Ishtar move around a lot and tells him about her birth parents. When he learns she is from the same district of Baghdad as his grandfather, he tells her about the time his grandfather asks the occupying American troops for water in his underwear. Later he walks around the halls and runs into Ishtar and asks about the other war orphans she adopted. She takes him to a room filled with paintings and photographs of all the children she adopted through the ages. She gives him a ring with the king's seal on it and tells him to return it to it’s owner in
   Central Park
   and to look out for Belet. Just then Sargon and the other cats alert her to Nergal's arrival. Sik realizes she was using Daoud as bait to lure Nergal to them and Ishtar tells him to get Kasusu. He gets Belet and he chases after her and they exit the house. They find Nergal and his demons at the end of the block street and the Plague God demands Sik, as Sik tries to talk his way out of things the cats transform into big cats with wings and Belet reveals they are actually guardian spirits called
   Lamassu
   . Soon Ishtar arrives and, after Belet hands over Kasusu, the two gods fight. As the fighting destroys the block, he and Belet urge the neighbors and Daoud to evacuate. They encounter a few demons, but Sargon and Belet take them out. Unfortunately, Ishtar is wounded and turns into stardust soon after. Sik urges a distraught Belet to run and, when she is out of sight, he surrenders.

   He is brought to a junkyard in Queens and Nergal demands he give him what his brother stole, which he denies and has no idea what it is. As the demons suggest different methods of torture, he looks for an escape route and finds a hole in the fence. He lies and says Idiptu had it all alone and Nergal's forces start fighting among themselves. He uses the opportunity to escape, he gets through the fence but he trips on a set of trains tracks and is hit by an oncoming train. He drifts in and out of consciousness, hearing the voices of the track workers and Belet talking to someone. When he comes to he finds himself in a body bag in a morgue and gets out, startling the coroner and finds a pair of scrubs and sneakers to wear. He calls Belet, who thinks it is a prank, but he gets her to believe him and she reveals they are having funeral prayers for him at the masjid. They agree to meet at a restaurant. After that she hugs him and they head to a hotel owned by a friend of Ishtar's and head to the penthouse. She explains the the train accident was three days ago and that Nergal's plague is transforming those infected with it into his servants. Just then Daoud emerges from the bathroom and hugs Sik, he is happy to see him until he learns he had Belet identify his "corpse" when he chickened out. He berates him for it until Daoud gets a call from his agent about auditioning for a Mexican drug lord and leaves. Sik gives his condolences and says he knows what she is going through, but she says a God's death is much more devastating then a moral's. Kasusu gives Belet a pep talk and says they need a plan, and Sik soon thinks of one.

   They head to Central Park to find the owner of the ring and find it converted in a camp for those trying to escape the plague. They find Sidana and Idiptu with some plague dogs and hide, unfortunately the plague dogs find their sent and they run, with him pulling Belet with him, while the demons are in shock over seeing someone they thought was dead. He and Belet take shelter in a glass ziggurat that the demons and plague hounds can't detect. As they explore, they come across a gardener who reveals the ring he has belongs to him. They ask for help defeating Nergal, but he refuses. When Sik asks for his name, he says he is
   Gilgamesh
   . Sik is awestruck that he is face to face with Gilgamesh and the King of Uruk invites him and Beltran for vegan sweets. He explains how he actually did eat part of the
   Flower of Immortality
   and fed the rest to a snake before faking his death. He and Belet plead with him to help them defeat Nergal, but he reveals he gave up fighting and took up gardening instead. He also tells Sik that the snake he fed the flower to helped create more and the his brother took one and it somehow made its way into his system, making him immortal. Ski says he planted the seeds in the community garden and he and Belet head out. Before heading out, he is told by Gilgamesh that Nergal needs the flower to regain his former self and not vanish and the Sik will have to pay a price for cheating death. As they walk, it starts to rain he wonders if his not being born in Iraq made him an outcast in his own family. Belet gets a cab and they ride to the garden, however they find a news segment calling Sik patient zero and the cabdriver freaks out and a crowd forms around the cab, only disbursing when he threatens to cough on them. When they make it to the garden,  find it bulldozed into a parking lot for new condos. As he thinks of their next move, Belet heads out to fight Nergal herself as he tries to stop her. She blames him for not tending to the garden enough and he blurts out he promised Ishtar he would look after her. Belet starts to tear up and takes out the picture of her birth parents and rips it up. He is stunned as she reveals it is a magazine clipping of actors from a soap opera, something she knew for years but faked not knowing to give Ishtar a sense that the girl was not alone. She gets in a cab and he chases after her. He loses her but finds a working subway and decides to see his parents. He runs into an old man named
   Harry
   who refers to himself in the past tense and they walk on to the platform with other people referring to themselves in the past tense. Soon a subway with cuneiform graffiti pulls up and he is dragged on, realizing to late that it is a train to the afterlife.

   The doors close and the train takes off as Sik becomes horrified and tries to think of how he might have died. The ghosts depart to their own afterlives until it is just him and Harry. The train stops in a desert and Sik disembarks after saying goodbye to Harry. He finds the remnants of long eroded buildings before a figure says his name from behind. As the figure reveals his face, Sik is happy to see Mo again. They talk in some ruins and he explains how Mo's final shipment contained the Flower of Immortality and that Nergal has brought a plague to the city. When Mo asks about the garden, he reluctantly reveals that it was turned into a parking lot. His brother berates him for not tending to it and he fires back by saying he always left him behind while he went on adventures. Soon a pride of
   Ugallu
   arrive with the ruler of
   Kurnugi
   ,
   Erishkigal
   , and someone else. They tell the brothers to bow and just before the goddess of death can order their deaths,
   Ishtar
   stops her. As he explains everything that happened since Nergal attacked them, the Queen of Night wants to kill him while Ishtar pulls her aside and thinks of an alternative. They decide to have the brothers go to the
   Sea of Tiamat
   to find the original flower in a cave in the
   Rock of Nisir
   , but they need to fight
   Humbaba
   , a creature immune to attacks. Later he and Ishtar talk about Belet and the girl's desire to trade places with her and warns Sik not to get a second exposure to to the flower would do it him. He and Mo fall asleep and wake up in a forest with Gilgamesh's boat where they run into Humbaba. The brother try to think of their next move as the giant thinks of eating them. Mo thinks of the Baghdad sauce Sik unknowingly has been offering him all this time and they trick the giant into drinking it. When he drinks it, he becomes overwhelmed by the taste and searches for water.  The brothers try and fail to move the boat as the sea comes to them. They cling to the boat as they are pummeled by waved and they pull themselves up when the current calms down. When they find the Rock of Nisir, the water gets rough again and they abandon ship. While he makes it to shore, Mo gets swept out to sea and he throws his bag at Mo, which turns into a net, and he pulls his brother to safety. Mo examines the bag and finds the symbol of Shamash, the patron god of kings, who had a net that can catch anything. They brace themselves and dive into calmer waters. He losses his breath for a second but he quickly realize he doesn’t need to break. They swim deeper until they find a hole leading to a grotto with a tree and find the flower. He picks it and puts it in his jacket as Mo senses something outside, they proceed with caution as they encounter a shiver of sharks and the
   Basmu Serpent
   . The brothers do what they can to evade the beast until he uses the bag and successfully tangles the serpent in it and they head to the surface as the serpent sinks. When they arrive, a
   Raven
   appears to guide Sik back to the land of the living. Sik is reluctant to go and offers to trade places with his brother, but Mo talks him out of it and vanishes. He follows the raven back home.

   He follows the raven until he ends up in the Jaqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir. He pulls himself on dry land and comes face to face with a snow leopard. They stare each other down until Belet arrives and fills him in. She explains that he was gone for two weeks and the city has nearly been taken over by Nergal. They go back to the ziggurat and meet back up with Gilgamesh. He shows him the flower and talks about his time in Kurnugi. As Gilgamesh prepares to make an antidote to put in the City's water supply, Nergal's forces finds them. The three stand down the demons and poxies as they demand their surrender. As Gilgamesh warns them to leave and they ignore his warning, the demigod unleashes lightning and hurricane level winds to scare them off. He tries and fails to convince Belet to retreat with him as Sidana attacks him and Belet kills the rat demon, but not before being dowsed in his poison and scratched by his claws. As Sik tries to use one of the flower's petals to heal her, Idiptu snatches it out of his hand. He picks up Belet and runs out of the park. When he stops she chastises him for losing the flower and running away. He agrees and puts her in a shopping cart and sets a course of
   Manhattan General Hospital
   to treat Belet and, if worse comes to worse, be with his parents in the end. He passes the deli to find it boarded up after being burned and vandalized with hateful graffiti. He sees cats inside and calls out, only to be answered by
   Daoud
   . He goes around back and, when Daoud lets him in, he is shocked to see Daoud missing teeth and hair. When he says he needs to take Belet to the hospital, he says it is overrun with the infected and they patch her up in his parent's room and they eat dinner in Daoud's room. He is surprised that Daoud kept it as Mo had, with only a few fashion magazines and products around the room. He finally looks at Daoud's portfolio and sees pictures of Mo and the Flower of Immortality. Daoud says he took it before the garden was turned into a parking lot turned the rest into a fragrance called Mo's Promise. He puts some in an eye dropper and gives it to Belet, who looks like she is about to die. After a few seconds she is healed and they explain to Daoud that the flower grants immortality, which he did not get due being careful not to make skin contact with the flower. They wonder if they should give the meager amount of what is left to Daoud or try to make more to cure the city, they chose the latter and Daoud gets his kit. As Belet inspects her now healed wound, she asks him if she is immortal or not.

   He and Belet wait in Ishtar's Jaguar for Daoud to make more perfume. He pushes a button and the car turns into a chariot. The lamassu are automatically hooked up just as a hoard of poxies attack. They take flight as the lamassu swat the infected away and he stops the flying big cats from killing them. Just as Daoud comes out with a pint of perfume, Sik tells him to get on the chariot as
   Idiptu
   emerges from
   Georiou's
   to kill them for killing Sidana. As they head to the hospital and avoid the poxies, he asks Daoud if he tested the perfume on himself, which he did not as he didn’t want to waist a drop. Soon they are ambushed by Idiptu and crash in an abandoned office building leaving two of the lamassu,
   Simba
   and
   Shere Khan
   , out of commission. As the fiat demon threatens to eat Daoud and the perfume is about to roll out a broken window, he and the other two lamassu,
   Sargon
   and
   Bagheera
   , kill Idiptu as Belet saves the perfume. They tell him to take the chariot to the hospital and he does so. As he rushes to the hospital, he encounters a rejuvenated Nergal, who asks Sik why he is waisting his time trying to heal those who hate him. When the god notices the jar and demands he hand it over, Sik refuses and is stabbed in the shoulder and thigh as he flies to the top of a nearby storm cloud and jumps in, opening the jar and watching the perfume mix with the rain as he falls. Sik wakes up to Belet nudging him as it rain. He soon realizes the perfume didn’t work as they are surrounded by Poxies and Nergal. As the Plague God is about to finish them off, his body starts to evaporate as the poxies are cured. He watches as Nergal begs Belet to spare him and evaporates before she can finish him off. He soon rushes to his parents at the hospital, which has been barricaded, and slips inside to meet them just as they are waking up.

   About a month later, he, his parents, and Daoud are preparing the deli for its reopening. As he and his father are painting, his father tells him that he and his mother, while in their comas, had a dream about him and Mo in a boat in rough waters and their eldest son telling them to hang on for Sik. Soon his father and Daoud trade places just as a man selling water from the night Nergal was defeated, called by many as the
   Big Rain

As Daoud leaves after getting a call from his agent about him getting the lead role in something, Belet arrives and, blushing, hands him a box of flowers from Gilgamesh. She reveals her plan go to

As Sik tells her he is immortal, Rabisiu attacks. However he sidesteps and Rabisu hits three trash cans. Sik's mother comes out and scolds him for not showing compassion for Rabisu, referring to the demon as a Djinn, and takes her inside as she cries about not being able to kill anyone and has Sik clean up. As Sik protests, he questions how Rabisu was able to topple multiple trash cans at once.

After explaining how modern heroes were inspired by myths around the world, he says that Gilgamesh was temporarily ruler of the land of the dead and anyone with his seal can pass through any realm he ruled over. Sik says he has the seal at home and Rabisu becomes overjoyed at the prospect that she could return home. Petar says to meet him at the United Nations building in an hour. They meet up in the visitors lobby and, in an attempt to get an elevator to themselves, they claim Rabisu is suffering from

As the elevator descends, Sik tries desperately to get out. Soon it stops and the lights go out. They come back on and they hear countless heartbeats. Rabisu starts to panic, thinking they were banished for eternity. The doors start to open, and they see Petar in the United Nations lobby. After Petar says it did not work, they describe what they heard to him and Petar becomes unnerved. When Sik asks what “they” are, Rabisu says they are the
   Anunna

Sik says her friends are toxic, but she says toxic friends are better then none. When they reach the deli, Sik is horrified to find it so backed up. He gives Rabisu the keys to let herself into the apartment and rushes over to help his parents, telling his mom he could not help Rabisu as a customer demands his food. After the last customer leaves, Sik and his mother head upstairs while his father cleans up. His mother asks him to check on Rabisu. He goes to his door and knocks, but gets no response. He goes to his mother, telling her Rabisu is asking for the impossible, but says he has done the impossible before. Sik goes back to his room and enters to find the window open.

     At first, Sik thought Belet was just a rich girl who attended his school, but as he spent time with her trying to stop Nergal, the two quickly grew close. When they were at the harbor Sik shielded her from a chain that was going to hit her, showing his concern for her. Shortly before the goddess is killed by Nergal, Ishtar made him promise to look out for her.
    </p>
    They got into a small fight after they supposedly lost the
    Flower of Immortality

     When he first met Ishtar, Sikander did not believe she was a Mesopotamian goddess. After she proves that she is who she says she is and shows him her past, he ran back home. After he and his family were hospitalized, she and Belet liberated him and brought him to their house. As the goddess brought Daoud to various upscale venues and events to find Nergal, he questioned her methods. Shortly before she was killed by Nergal, he promised the goddess that he would look after Belet.

    Sik hates the plague god for destroying his family's deli and getting his parents sick. He managed to escape the god's forces when ever the two came face to face, either with the help of his friends or if the god thought he was dead. During their final encounter, the god promised to cure his parents if he handed over the cure for the city. When Nergal's immortality is canceled out by a double dose of the flower of immortality, Sik simply watches with relief as the god dies.
