Osiris, though unable to return to the living world, was restored to authority as the Lord of the Dead.

   As Egyptian dynasties past, the gods continued to host humans, particularly humans with the
   Blood of the Pharaohs
   , since they are very suitable to contain the essence of a god. On rare occasions, a god is able to become one with their host, essentially becoming one being that has neither the god or the human in control, but rather a combination of the two working in perfect harmony. This is said to be extremely rare and only happened with mortals that have the blood of the pharaohs.

Carter takes his rightful place as pharaoh, aided by Ra's crook and flail given to him by the god and leads the magicians into battle, with even the rebels joining him after Apophis' influence upon their leaders is revealed. Carter also calls upon the gods as pharaoh as well under Ra's direction. All gods, including those who were once his enemy, respond to his call and join battle with Apophis. Apophis swallows Ra, but Carter and Sadie, with both their power and Horus and Isis', cast an execration spell on Apophis'

   After the destruction of Apophis, Ra decides to have the gods exile themselves from Earth for a time though they still play their various roles in the world. Horus and Carter officially become pharaohs of the magicians and the gods respectively, with Horus apparently even ripping off Carter's acceptance speech for his own. However, despite the leaving of the gods, one is allowed to remain on Earth: Anubis who remains in Walt. The two become one being like the pharaohs of old when they were god-kings so Anubis is allowed to stay. This has benefits for both: it allows them both to be with Sadie Kane at the same time who they both love, it allows Walt to live as without Anubis he will die of his curse and it allows Anubis to experience mortal life for the first time as he has never had a human host before, never having needed one. It also allows both Anubis and Walt to experience the joys of life as both were denied that before due to their godhood and the curse hanging over their heads respectively before.

   Unlike their Greek, Roman and Norse counterparts, Egyptian Gods do not have demigod children. They also can not walk the mortal world like the other pantheons of Gods without a host body to anchor themselves to the mortal world or else they slip back into the Duat. They are more like beings of energy then physical beings like the other pantheons. Being part of Ma'at means that they have to keep Ma'at and Chaos balanced so they can only be in the world as much as Chaos is. This means currently their involvement is incredibly limited due to the execration of Apophis.

These traces may also allow former hosts to control animals that come under the gods authority. For example,
