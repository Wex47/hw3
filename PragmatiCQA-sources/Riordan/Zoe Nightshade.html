While Percy is holding up the sky he sees Thalia and Luke fight each other, but he mainly pays attention to Zoë and Artemis who are fighting Atlas. Percy witnessed that Atlas was about to strike Artemis but then Zoë jumps in the middle and shoots an arrow at Atlas, Atlas knocks Zoë to the side sending her sprawling into a bunch of big black rocks, further injuring Zoë. Percy later tricks Atlas into taking his burden of holding up the sky and Atlas is stuck once more. Annabeth was then freed from her bonds and trying to stop Luke and Thalia from fighting, when her father comes in with a Sopwith Camel firing celestial bronze bullets at the monsters. Meanwhile, Percy and Artemis are trying to help Zoë.

   , Zoë fought with Thalia quite often. This was because Thalia had refused to join the Hunters when Zoë offered her the chance. However, she eventually changes her mind, influenced no doubt by Zoë and Bianca's bravery. Privately, Zoë admitted to Percy that she knew that she could not be Artemis' lieutenant forever and implied that she wanted Thalia to be her replacement. Zoë expressed regret at the end of her life for her fights with Thalia, wishing that they could've been sisters.

   , the sword that Zoë had given to Hercules. As a result of her hatred of men, Zoë was at first somewhat irrational in her dealings with Percy, refusing to let him join her quest or even to help against the
   Nemean Lion
   at first. After Percy's strategy allowed them to defeat the Lion, he earned some of Zoë's respect with Zoë even bantering with Percy a little bit before accepting him into the quest. As time went on, Zoe saw for herself that Percy was nothing like Hercules and was a good person, even opening up to him a little bit as he began to understand Zoë's past and what was driving her hatred of men. With her dying breaths she told Percy,
   <i key="55202c84-ea20-4e86-9b08-956ff6813447">
    "you spoke the truth. You are nothing like... like Hercules. I am honored that you carry this sword,"

   referring to the fact that she was the original owner and creator of Riptide.
  </p>
  <p key="9314aac1-bb2d-4b8e-bc23-d129bfda3f93">
   Throughout the book, Zoë was shown to speak Early Modern, or Shakespearean English. She was also said to speak in a strange accent, more heavily when she is upset. She also showed a particular interest and love for the stars, she was also offended when Percy referred to Ursa Major constellation as "the bear thing", and when Percy talks about the bear simply being a constellation, Zoë claimed that "It was a worthy opponent!" She gets especially irritated whenever Thalia corrected her speech, exclaiming "I hate this language! It changes too often!" referring to the way the English language has changed over the centuries. She herself spoke using "thou, thee, and thy." Zoë also had some of her father's traits, but was overall a much kinder person that Percy had come to respect.
  </p>
  <p key="d38c121c-a4e6-4a85-abca-66ebb2851a1f">
   In the beginning, Zoë seemed aloof and unfriendly, but turned out to have a big heart and endless loyalty to Artemis. When Atlas was about to kill Percy, she screamed, "NO!" and fired a handful of arrows into his armpit so he would turn on her and give Percy a chance to recover, Percy would've died at that moment if it wasn't for Zoë. She also gave her life to save Artemis despite knowing that the line in the prophecy saying "One shall perish by a parent's hand" was referring to her. She knew she was going to die, but went on the quest anyways. She has the quality of a true hero, which is why Artemis homered her by putting her up into the stars.

    Zoë was an extremely loyal and devoted lieutenant to Artemis. She loved Artemis over anyone, a love that her mistress reciprocated. When she saw Artemis being forced to hold up the sky, she was in tears and begging Atlas to free her. Atlas challenged her to take it for Artemis, and she would have, if Artemis had not forbidden her to do so. Before Zoë died, Artemis assured her that she had served her with great honor, and was the finest of her attendants. She even transformed Zoë into a constellation as a way of ensuring that she would be honored by the world. Zoë's death was probably one of the hardest deaths for Artemis

    Even before the events of the series, Zoë and Thalia had been at odds. Their feud originated when Thalia refused Zoë's invitation to join the Hunters and her advice that all men would let her down. The two fought over the smallest things, including the proper way to speak current English. However, the two reconciled after the fight with Atlas, with Thalia admitting that Zoë may have been right about men, and the dying Zoë admitting that she may have been wrong. Zoë even apologized for their arguments and admitted that she would have been happy to have Thalia as her sister. Following her death, Thalia succeeds her as the lieutenant of the Hunters of Artemis. During an earlier conversation with

Back then, Anaklusmos (Riptide) was a hair clip she owned, but she gave it to Hercules as a gift in order to aid him in his labor, and betrayed her family in order to make sure Hercules succeeded. Hercules eventually betrayed Zoë, resulting in her extreme dislike of men, heroes especially, comparing them all to Hercules. Just seeing

     However, during the fight with the
     Nemean Lion
     , Percy earned some of her respect by coming up with the plan that allowed the Hunters of Artemis to slay the monster. To Percy's surprise, Zoë insisted that Percy be the one to claim
     the lion's pelt
     as a
     spoil of war
     and she even joked with him about his strategy. Zoë then accepted Percy as the fifth member of her quest rather than letting him leave with monsters approaching. Although still wary of Percy, Zoë becomes more trusting and friendly towards him, particularly after Percy begins to understand the source of her hatred of men and to demonstrate that he is not like Hercules. Before she dies, Zoë says that Percy is nothing like Hercules and that she is honored he carries the sword she made. She also says that not all men are bad, and looks at Percy after saying this to Thalia, having accepted Percy as a true friend. In turn, Percy is shown to be devastated by Zoë's death.

    Subsequently, Percy is shown to remember Zoë with fondness, her bravery especially. Percy would call Zoë one of the bravest people she'd ever met to
