Atlas readily agreed and went to get the apples, but when he returned, the Titan saw a chance to escape his punishment. Atlas offered to deliver the apples himself to King Eurystheus. Hercules, however, saw the trick and pretended to agree, but asked Atlas to hold the sky for only a moment, while Hercules padded his shoulders with his thick

Atlas also despises the punishment the gods gave him (holding the sky on his shoulders for all eternity) and writhes with anguish when forced to endure it again.
