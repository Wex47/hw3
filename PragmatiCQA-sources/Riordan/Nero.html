   Nero was born on 15 December 37 AD in
   Antium
   , the only son of Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus and Agrippina the Younger (Emperor

   ’s sister). At the age of 16, Nero succeeded Claudius as emperor when the latter fell ill and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD, allegedly poisoned by Agrippina. However, Agrippina was domineering and Nero eventually had her killed in the fifth year of his reign (62 AD) by Anicetus, Agrippina's death raised Nero's popularity. He was married three times and became a widower as many times, his first wife, Octavia, being put to death by him on false charges of adultery.

   On the 18th of July, 64 AD, a disaster followed; it is uncertain whether it were by chance or by a plot of the emperor (for each side has its believers), but it was graver and more destructive than any which had previously come upon the city with the ravages of fire. Its beginnings were in the part wherein the Circus stood, which was in proximity to the
   Palatine
   and
   Caelian
   hills. Thence, it sprung forth amongst the shops that held many goods whereby flame was easily sustained, and, carried by the wind, it swiftly passed along the length of the Circus, for neither houses ringed by barriers nor temples girthed by walls were there to hinder the fire.

   At that time, Nero, who was in Antium, did not return to the city until the fire was approaching his house. Nor could it be halted, even when Palatine hill, his house, and everything in that region was burned up. After the fire finally stopped, instead of rebuilding the houses on Palatine Hill, he would use this cleared land to make space for his palace complex, the

   Afterwards he blamed the Great Fire on the Christians and persecuted them endlessly, throwing hundreds to the lions and burning them alive on crosses at his parties if not for the sake of his own amusement, which is what Apollo noticed when he attended one of his garden parties. He believed they were out to undermine traditional roman values.

   When construction expenses forced him to raise taxes and pillage religious treasures, support for Nero crumbled until Gaius Julius Vindex, governor of Gallia Lugdunensis, ultimately rebelled and declared himself emperor.
   Nero was soon declared a public enemy (

   ) by the Senate, and in the midst of the chaos, he decided to commit suicide, stabbing himself in the throat with a dagger on the 9th of June 68 AD; supposedly, his final words were “Too late! This is fidelity!”
   Soon after, Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, took advantage of the situation and obtained the throne through military support, beginning the Year of the Four Emperors. However, commoners rioted and rebelled refusing to believe that Nero was dead, but in fact

   Nero became a god-emperor but he didn't really like it all that much. During the Middle Ages, his name was almost forgotten and he was little more than a mirage. But then came the Renaissance, when the Roman classical greatness was remembered. What helped Nero more after that was the Internet, as this way he could not

Nero finally gets down to the last remote, but Apollo finds he has only one arrow left beside the Arrow of Dodona. Nico however, was about to be killed, so Apollo shoots at that Germani, disintegrating it. Much to their horror, Nero has activated the last remote and gloats at Apollo and his friends.

Nero is infamous for his tyranny and overindulgence in wealth and luxury with little regard to his subjects.

He also killed numerous Christians during his reign (including Saint Peter), crucifying and burning many of them alive. He also has some charisma.
