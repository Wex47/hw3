   , the Mayan god of storms and fire, and Mrs. Obispo, a mortal woman. Before he was even a year old, Zane would speak in complete sentences. Around this time, he also touched his mother's curling iron without being burned. He would also try to crawl out into the desert. When he was two, his maternal grandmother died, with her grave being close to his house. When Zane was eight his mother gave him a five part encyclopedia set on the history of
   Mexico
   , he would heavily favor the second volume. He once accidentally broke his uncle's taillight with his cane and stole a pack of sour patch kids from the dollar store. In elementary school, he had a teacher named
   Mr. Hawkins
   .

He says he told the tour guide, but no one believed him. Hondo tells Zane and Brooks to investigate as he has to pack for a trip he is taking with his girlfriend

   as they zoom to the island. When they arrive, Brooks hears the birds warning them as Zane hears nothing. As Brooks notices the birds have no eyes, a storm appears over the island and separates the two. The wind dies down and they fall. Zane sees symbols on the walls before landing on a ledge, looking down he throws a fireball and sees dozens of viper boas, looking up he sees Brooks on another ledge. She tells him the birds were calling them a threat and her arm is sprained and there is no service, with the only way out is to climb down. Zane agrees and they start climbing. He drops his phone, but hears it buzz when they reach the bottom. After finding two tunnels, they go into the one on the left and start to hear a baby's cry. Suddenly it stops and they see a figure approaching them, another Zane Obispo. As the son of Hurakan inspects his shadowy double, he throws fire and Fuego at it to no effect. It slashes Zane's arm as Brooks is able to disintegrate it with her shrieks, turning it into a pile of scales. Brooks reveals her arm is healed and they fly out and onto a beach on Isla Holbox. Zane signals for Rosie and tells her to get

   As he tells Brooks he believes that thing in the cave was not Mayan, the Queen of Xib'alb'a arrives and demands Zane show her. After she does she says it is nothing of their concern but they know she is withholding something from them. Ixtab agrees to tell them if they agree to keep this information to themselves under threat of half a year in the Underworld. They agree but she only tells them the gods fought monsters before time began and imprisoned them deep in the Earth, with the symbol meaning hope. She refuses to say more, but agrees to have it looked into when he says a human saw it. Before leaving, she informs Brooks that Zane will be spending time with his father the following week. When the goddess leaves, Brooks asks Zane why he did not tell her about spending time with his dad. He says he just wanted to spend a normal week with her and she agrees to it, but he wants to return to Pájaros to investigate as Ixtab never said it was not a demon and never barred them from returning. Brooks says she won't let him, but Zane convinces her by saying Ixtab could cover the whole thing up and she agrees to a flyover.

   When they do a flyover, everything seems normal but Zane asks to get a closer look. Brooks reluctantly gets closer as they see normal birds this time and spot a demon digging something up. After it leaves, Zane lands to investigate and finds a stone box buried in the sand. He opens it to find a black shell with the symbol etched into it with gold strands on the bottom. He inspects the lid to see two demons have a party and a pair of familiar eyes. Brooks realizes the eyes are the same as what they faced in the cave as three demons appear. They sneak into the
   Caribbean Sea
   and Brooks drags them back to Isla Holbox. Zane thinks the eyes look like alien eyes as he realizes they are from Eyes in the Sky, a blog on extraterrestrial life by

When the death god was gravely injured fighting
    Camazotz

    Death Ceremony
