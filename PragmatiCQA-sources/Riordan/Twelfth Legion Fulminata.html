   , roughly translated as "[Caesar] put Titus Labienus in charge of the defenses that he had made; he himself hurried on a great journey to Italy, and there he created two legions and led three out of their winter-camps". Legio XII was one of two that he created in Italy to assist in his war against the Helvetii. The legion was given many nicknames throughout its years of service, the most notable being

   himself. The Twelfth was active throughout the span of the Roman Empire, notably during the Jewish Rebellion (in which it lost its eagle at the battle of Beth Horon in 66 A.D., but somehow recovered it so Michael Varus could lose it again in Alaska), the miraculous Siege of Alesia (52 BC) and the Battle of Pharsalus (when Caesar defeated his rival Pompey the Great) in 48 BC, being last mentioned in historical records 500 A.D, presumably when they went underground. The Twelfth Legion was active throughout Trajan's Dacian Wars, having been noted for gallantry in the battle for Adamclisi. Also being noted for action in Lucius Verus' war against Parthia in 162 A.D., the Twelfth Legion later occupied the frontier of the Euphrates River until the start of the 5th Century. In later centuries it came to be commonly known as the
