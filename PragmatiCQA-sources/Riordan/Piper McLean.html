   Piper got her name from her
   Grandpa Tom
   , who noted her strong voice and hoped that she would one day learn all of the great Cherokee songs, including the Song of the Snakes. As opposed to many other children of Aphrodite, Piper was never very focused on her natural beauty and has a somewhat tomboyish style. At one point, she helped her actor father research

   Her father would also tell her old Cherokee stories he heard from Grandpa Tom. From time to time, Piper and her father would play a game called "Any Three Questions," in which Piper would ask her father any three questions of her choice and he had to answer them without lying. Her main intention was to find out more about her mother who apparently left after she was born. However, Piper wasn't able to learn much about her mother. She later recalls how her father had driven Piper past a meat-processing plant in Chino when she was little. The smell had been enough to turn Piper into a vegetarian. Ever since then, just the thought of cows made her ill. As

   and uses it (unknowingly) to gain her father's attention by "borrowing" things from salesmen, causing her to get into trouble with the law when the people report her for stealing. At one point, she talked a car dealer into giving her a BMW and drove it away from the lot. She only stole items because she wanted to gain attention from her father, whom she believed wasn't spending enough time with her. The dealer pressed charges for theft after Piper took the BMW and realized that he had been tricked. Her father's assistant,

  </h2>
  <p key="5bc3d59d-b02f-4f5c-99f7-3e0333cfc256">
   Piper McLean is a calm but rebellious spirit who is always loyal and protective of her friends and isn't afraid to stand up for them. Piper has always followed her heart and is also a leader, as she is the counselor of Aphrodite cabin. Her disagreement with the rite of passage and how Drew bullied her siblings shows that she doesn't like cruelty. She stands for her beliefs and fights to right the wrongs in her cabin.
  </p>
  <p key="505c076f-d315-4e6c-94ec-13673f31cb77">
   Piper was very caring and loving towards her ex-boyfriend Jason and was frightened, sad, and angry at anything that may pose a threat to her bond with him, such as when Drew claims that Piper needs to break his heart as an initiation into the cabin. She was greatly saddened by the possibility that her first relationship with Jason was a

   </a>
   's last name is (which she doesn't know). She also likes to touch Jason in affectionate and loving ways such as holding his hand, leaning against his chest, resting her head on his leg, wrapping her arms around him and having his arms around her.  These memories are much sharper to Piper because she is a daughter of
   <a href="Aphrodite.html" key="a9967ce8-8dc5-4b5c-8c77-baa4b47d1f57" title="Aphrodite">
    Aphrodite
   </a>
   , so she can sense possibilities. She also seems to have a soft spot for her friend Leo Valdez. She does tend to be quite possessive over Jason during certain times, including when he wore purple, the color of the Romans, and when talking to Annabeth during the campfire, and she gets jealous rather easily. She can be a bit impulsive and acts before thinking, but does so with positive intentions, like bringing Jason and Percy to the Nymphaeum despite her vision.
  </p>
  <p key="72eb9eb8-1999-47db-8370-dc7657e9c413">
   While generally kind to others, Piper's biases can cause her to seem shallow and prejudiced to others. She does not have much in common with typical children of Aphrodite, and did stereotype her mother and siblings on occasion. She tends to avoid strong femininity, not acting so herself and subconsciously judging others that are very feminine, not particularly liking the pink, lace, and strong scent of perfume found in the Aphrodite cabin.
  </p>
  <p key="df3c892b-2c6c-4c80-8ff7-7d2c41cf9774">
   Piper is kind and compassionate to her friends and has a good perception of other's feelings as a daughter of Aphrodite. She's stated to be a good comforter, comforting others with both support and sympathy and occasionally calming them down with her charmspeak. Piper is spirited, and can be seen as almost aggressive to those around her. Her strong compassion and empathy for others lead her in most decisions. Piper is somewhat tomboyish, stating she does not care about her looks, but tending to feel insecure about her appearance throughout the series. She occasionally charmspoke some of her closest friends to make them feel better, but stopped doing so as often after learning the harmful effect it has (as stated during the confrontation with Medea). She tends to be laid-back most of the time but is also shown to have a fiery temper, like almost smacking Drew for insulting her hair, almost starting a fight with Isabel and her friends, and stating she "caused fights often" when asked why she got kicked out of schools. When claimed by Aphrodite, she is upset that she can't get rid of her makeup or her new hairstyle and finds it to be annoying, to say the least.
  </p>
  <p key="62aa2110-6315-4e94-bc13-bb92b37b9d1f">
   While a compassionate person, Piper has a tendency to consider her own wants and needs when making a decision to a healthy level, like wanting Jason to be with her instead of leaving to his old home, wishing for her mother to continue 'influencing' Jason, being upset at losing her and Jason's Mist-induced relationship with Jason getting his memories back, initially disliking Reyna for her past relationship with Jason, not going to Jason's funeral, and getting a girlfriend only three months after he died. She was also concerned about Jason losing his memories of her, along with his memories in general after he got hit in the head with a brick, and was worried about the Greeks and Romans uniting out of fear that Jason would leave her. Piper was also focused on her relationship with Jason, and thought about him during quests.
  </p>
  <p key="c18fb1c3-36ad-4721-9f92-f714f5227097">
   Overall, Piper's personality is one of a kind. She is very caring and has a great sense of humor. Her mood can change when things get serious, and she feels  normal fear which most heroes won't admit. She's open and brave when she needs to be, and a great, compassionate friend.

   , Piper was first described by Jason to be a beautiful girl of Indigenous (Cherokee) descent, with chocolate-brown hair that was cut choppy and unevenly, and had thin strands braided down on the sides. Her eyes seemed to change color like a kaleidoscope, going from brown to blue to green, and she was dressed in a fleece snowboarding jacket, faded jeans, and hiking boots. Though she wore no makeup, and had facial imperfections (such as pimples, namely one at the base of her nose, which had been there for some time that she even started to call it Bob), she was still so beautiful that she drew attention even when trying not to.

   , she temporarily became the most beautiful girl in Camp Half-Blood--her hair turned lush and long, braided with gold ribbons down one side so it fell across her shoulder, and she wore perfect makeup that made her lips cherry-red and brought out all the different colors in her eyes. Her skin also became perfect, she was adorned in a beautiful, sleeveless, ankle-length white gown with an embarrassingly low V-neck, and her biceps were circled by delicate gold armbands, while an intricate necklace of amber, coral, and gold flowers glittered on her chest. Her pimple also disappeared too. Piper thought that she looked like a Cherokee Barbie and wanted her old look back but after trying everything, nothing worked. Jason Grace even exclaimed that she was

He even began wishing their fake relationship was real the longer he spent with her, but thought it wasn't fair to Piper, in case he had someone waiting for him back home. Jason told Piper she was amazing after they left the palace, but Piper felt guilty, thinking if he knew the truth about her, he wouldn't like her anymore.

After that, Jason encouraged Piper to get some sleep and she put her head in his lap and started snoring. Jason encouraged her to tell him and Leo about her father when he found out he was in trouble, but Piper didn't want to, afraid it would hurt them. Piper eventually told Jason and Leo, and to her surprise, Jason put his arm around her and apologized for what happened to her dad, and said he trusted her with his life. After she saved him and he had to go home, his memories of the incident erased, Piper sobbed into Jason's shirt and he hugged her, and he said she did amazing.

However, Piper was jealous of Reyna and felt guilty about being Jason's boyfriend after she met her for the first time, and was worried that Jason had feelings for her. The jealousy was made worse when Jason encouraged Piper to tell Reyna the truth about what happened, and Hazel and Annabeth winced, wondering how he could be so clueless.

Jason finally admitted to Piper that he hadn't told her everything in the burning maze, and tried to apologize, but Piper pushed for information. Piper was angry when he didn't want to tell her, and said after all of the dangers they have faced, she was mad that he was lying to her, just to protect her from

     Oklahoma
     , and that he planned to let her go and face Caligula himself. Jason told Piper the truth later, and Piper said he would have done the same thing if she were him. She said she was furious, but also empathetic. Apollo was surprised how well they understood each other and could talk about difficult subjects. When they made it to the

     Jason later sacrificed himself and died to save Piper. Piper tried to warn him about Caligula and tell him to leave with her, but he was killed by Caligula to make sure she wouldn't die. Piper was devastated when Jason died, and was in a panic: yelling at Apollo, throwing sand, slapping away the ambrosia and nectar Apollo tried to give her, and shuddering with dry sobs. Piper refused to believe he was dead, and said Jason had gone through too much to die. When
     Tempest
     brought Jason's body to the beach, she begged Apollo to fix him, and shook his dead body, yelling his name. She mentioned a Cherokee legend that said that a plant could cure him, and mentioned that he could go through the

Apollo told her she couldn't, and Piper became furious, saying that he didn't care, and was angry that he died for a pair of shoes just for Apollo to see an Oracle. She told her father he died in a surfing accident while sobbing, and told Apollo to never come back, blaming him for his death. Piper later avenged his death by defeating Medea, telling her that while Jason is in

     . Piper practiced lines to say to Reyna when she met her, but ended up not having to say them since Reyna welcomed her and her friends, and since Jason introduced Piper to Reyna. However, Reyna quickly grew jealous of Piper as she looked between Piper and Jason with her brow creased, realizing they were a couple, and her eyes became stormy. Reyna became even more jealous when Jason asked to walk around

     As for Piper, she was prepared to hate Reyna, but admired the way she kept her feelings in check, staying polite and in control after realizing she was dating Jason. Piper didn't blame Reyna for having a crush on Jason, and knew why she would. She respected her for giving the Greeks a fair chance and putting the needs of her Camp ahead of her emotions, and thought she wasn't so bad. Reyna even made Piper feel guilty about dating Jason, which was silly to Piper since Reyna never dated Jason. But Piper never wanted to befriend her and the Romans in the first place, since she was afraid Jason would leave her for Reyna and Camp Jupiter. Seeing Reyna made Piper's worries about Jason leaving her worse. Piper's jealousy became even worse after Jason suggested that Piper contact her to convince her that they were innocent, oblivious to her jealousy, making Piper feel like all the blood in her body was draining to her feet. Piper said she could try, but she knew Reyna wouldn't be able to stop Octavian. Piper lamented to Jason how Reyna was powerful, beautiful, and Roman, and was jealous of how he trusted her, but Jason reassured her she didn't want her to be Reyna, she wanted her to be herself.

After Piper arrived at Camp, Reyna seemed to have been over her jealousy also and said it was about time she came, and Piper grinned, saying she had some giants to kill. Reyna returned the smile and told her to help herself to some barbarians, and Piper thanked her, making them jump into battle side by side. After that incident, Piper and Reyna, along with Annabeth, became inseparable as they helped the two Camps get along, wandering around Camp to check on the repairs, and Reyna valued Piper as a go-between between conflicts. At the campfire one night, Piper teased Reyna and asked if she was sure if her mother was a war goddess, and Reyna said she still intended to fight battles, but now they fight together.

     The day Reyna left, Reyna and Piper had one last conversation at the dock. Piper thought that Reyna was the only demigod who hadn't changed much during their journey, and knew she had been through a lot of pain. She wondered how she could bear it all and wondered if she had anything to confide in. Piper also thought she had a regal and beautiful face. Piper told Reyna that she did so much for both camps and wished she got more credit, and that without her, nothing they did would have been possible. Reyna laughed and thanked Piper, but said she didn't want attention, and that she knew what that was like. Piper understood that she didn't want to attract attention, after being a daughter of a movie star. Piper also told her she could sense that she could lend strength to others. Reyna was skeptical and wondered if Nico told her, but Piper said it was because she can sense it and see how much it drains her. After Piper asked her how she gets her strength back, Reyna joked that when she does, she will let her know, but Piper could sense sadness behind the words. Piper offered that if she needed time to take a break or get away, she can come to Camp Half-Blood and it would be good for her to take time for herself. Piper also joked that they would have to ban her from capture the flag because she could beat the entire camp solo. Reyna thanked Piper and said she would consider the offer.

    Before Reyna left, she asked Piper to explain something that

    told her, since she was her daughter. Reyna told her what Venus told her in Charleston, and her words broke as she said how much she struggled with that. Piper became mad at her mother since she keeps ruining lives. Piper then tells her that she didn't know what she meant, but she knows that Reyna is an incredible person and that there is someone out there for her, and maybe it’s not a demigod or it is a mortal. Piper said that until then she has friends, and that even though she gives strength from others, she needs to draw from it once and awhile, and she is here for her. Reyna said that she had a way with words, and Piper promised she wasn't charmspeaking. Reyna said no charmspeaking was required and held out her hand to shake it. They shook hands and Reyna said she has a feeling she would see her again, and a Piper knew, because she was her friend and family now. That night, Piper thought the camp was empty without her and the Romans.

However, they were still friendly and Leo teased Piper about her stealing a BMW. Leo also winked and shot her a finger fun at the campfire. As for Piper, she thought a Leo was annoying, like when they were on the way to

     Calais

He was excited when the mist memories were fake because he felt like it was a chance to reset their dynamic. But since Piper and Jason were heading to be a couple again, he thought they didn't want Leo around and he was worried being an odd man out again. He also felt like a reject when Piper and Jason got to see

     . Piper was very grateful when he saved her life and asked if he was okay, and Leo apologized for not telling her about the fire. But Piper grinned and punched his arm, saying it was amazing. Piper comforted Jason when Festus died. Leo also comforted Piper when he learned about her dad, and assured her that he will help her. Leo comforted Piper again when her father went home, giving her Kleenex, and Piper thought how much he meant to her.

     Leo and Piper later had a heartfelt conversation, with Leo comforting Piper about her dad.  He reassured her that he will be fine with Coach Hedge protecting him. Leo was secretly struck by how much Piper had changed and seemed more present in the moment. He thought about how she spent her entire semester at the wilderness School trying not to be seen, and now she was impossible to miss. Piper confided in Leo about how she was worried about Jason, and that he may be the enemy. Leo was worried too, but reassured her that he wouldn't betray them after all they had been through, and said they were a team. Leo also realized that Piper was scared of losing Jason after losing her father, and couldn't imagine how it was for her to see her dad break down. Leo reassured her that she was the strongest, most powerful beauty queen he ever met, and she could trust herself and him. Piper was impressed later when Leo showed her and Jason

Leo was not oblivious to her family stress and knew she was sensitive about both her godly and Cherokee sides of her family, though it was hard to keep track which made her more sensitive each day. The two and Jason cooperated well in defeating the
     Maenads
     and saving Camp. That night, Leo, Piper, and Jason drank hot chocolate at the campfire and Leo thanked Piper for saving him yet again. He enjoyed their company and they did a toast to friendship.

Leo said she didn't have to stand up for him, and Piper said of course she would, he was the annoying little brother she never had, showing how much she cared for him. Leo also teased Piper and said she had power ranger pajamas, and Piper said they were Cherokee Eagles. When Leo went missing in the Atlantic Ocean, Piper didn't sleep that night and looked in visions in

She was originally mad at Hazel and Frank when they kept his plan from her, but she agreed that it was a plan Leo would've done. Piper said that if he was here, she would kill him, and wondered how Leo took the cure alone. Piper and Jason then spent a night talking about Leo, and Piper hoped that Leo was alive, and out there. She felt guilty about his death and replayed the scene in her head, and felt like she failed him, though throughout the series Piper tended to forget about Leo like almost never checking up on him despite stating she's good with telling people's emotions and forgetting to check up on him when he's upset, usually prioritizing Jason, Annabeth, and Hazel above Leo and preferring to spend time with them instead of Leo, and she tended not to think about Leo much.

However, Piper thought that Percy was unimpressive compared to Jason, and thought it was underwhelming seeing him after hearing so much about him for months. He wasn't Piper's type and thought he looked like a skater boy, a troublemaker, and if she saw him at a mall she would steer clear of him. But Piper could see why Annabeth liked him and knew why he needed her in his life, and thought if anyone could control a guy like that, she could.

As for Hazel, Hazel was very close to Piper but kept Leo's suicidal plan from her, at his insistence, and felt very guilty when she gave a fake version of the cure made from the mist to Piper. After Leo’s death, Hazel broke down and told Piper to take out the cure, and then Piper glared at Hazel when the cure was gone. Piper was originally angry at Hazel for not revealing Leo's plan, but couldn’t stay mad at her while she was crying and agreed that it was exactly a plan Leo would've done.

Piper also felt Nico’s defenses going up, afraid of what him or Leo would say about him when he was gone. However, Nico and Piper cooperated well going into the

As for Nico, Nico greatly appreciated Piper for everything she had done for him, welcoming him on to the ship and saving him in Rome, and when he found out one of the Seven may die he felt empty, like he was back in the bronze jar. Nico was worried when Octavian wanted to fire an onager, and warned him not to, because either Piper or Jason would get hurt.

Apollo was very surprised by Piper's beautiful voice, and even more surprised by the sadness in the tune she chose, making every note he played on his ukekele a note of sympathy for Piper. When they made it to the next yacht, she forced Piper to rest and gave her a minute to rest, and carried her inside Yacht 40. On the yacht, Piper confided in Apollo how the song she sang was from her happiest memory. Piper then told Apollo the reasons why she broke up with Jason, and how she had so much pressure to conform. Apollo gave Piper advice, and said even though she can choose how much ancestry she can embrace, and she can overcome the expectations on her family and her society, she cannot try to be someone other than herself. Piper was grateful for his advice and asked if he wasn't the god of wisdom, and Apollo joked that he applied but didn't get the job. Piper burst out laughing, and Apollo was grateful for his new friendship and could not recall the last time she had such a positive exchange with an equal.

Piper lashed out at Apollo in anger and accused him of not caring about Jason's death because he is a god, and that he was using her to get what he wanted, just like all the other gods. Piper angrily gave him the shoes they needed, saying they got Jason killed. And after Apollo, Meg, and

     . Piper was very surprised at the end of the quest when Coach Hedge offered to take her father home, thinking he was the last person to offer. He said that he was a protector and she needed to carry on with her quest, and that he can handle this. He hugged Piper before he left then glared at Leo and Jason, telling them to protect her. She gave him another hug, telling him to protect her dad, and he reassured her yet again.

He promised that he would make sure that Tristan rests and talks to Piper while keeping him out of the public eye. Piper was amazed and supportive when she found out he was dating

     , Hedge was very close to Piper and the McLean family and made sure Mellie protected the household while he was gone. Coach Hedge is even more protective of Piper than Leo and Jason, two other demigods he was close with. As for Piper, she was extremely grateful for everything he did for her- saving her father and helping him get back on his feet. Coach Hedge tried to hide it, but Piper was pretty sure he came along with her on the quest was because her father encouraged him to come along and protect her. Piper thought of him as a weird chaperone and the most warlike goat she ever met, but still deeply cared for him. During the quest, Piper learned to be appreciative of his healing skills, like when he healed Percy and Jason after being possessed by

     , Coach Hedge was laid off from being Tristan's life Coach and didn't see Piper that often, since she was busy with school and quests, and Mellie didn't want him to see her because it would break her heart after what happened to her family. Coach Hedge still deeply cared about the McLean's, however, and told Apollo, Grover, and Meg to give her his best when they saw her. He felt very bad for Piper after what happened to her family, and hoped she wasn't evicted before she moved to Oklahoma. Coach Hedge was very worried about her after she fought Medea and urged her to drink more water. As for Piper, she was very close with the Hedge family and he even let her play with his son,
     Chuck Hedge
     , who sat on her lap. But Piper never told Hedge the whole truth about what happened with Jason, because it rattled her too much. The next day, Hedge wanted to accompany Piper to meet Jason, but Mellie quickly un-volunteered him.
    </p>
    After Jason died, Coach Hedge's primary concern was for Piper and he immediately asked Apollo for the car keys and took Mellie to go see her, saying that Piper needs them and he needs to care for her. After the incident, Coach Hedge and his family decided that they would not be staying in California, and would instead be moving to Oklahoma with the McLean family, saying he could find a job there even though he wasn't Tristan's life coach anymore. Before they left, Coach Hedge was grim and determined to protect Piper on the way and asked her if she was ready. Piper wondered if his car was ready for such a long trip, and Coach Hedge reassured her that it was, though Mellie was distrustful of that and rode with Piper in the SUV.
