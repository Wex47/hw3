The two talked about Percy for a few minutes until Annabeth said she was being rude and introduced Rachel to Piper. Piper asked if she could see the future, and Rachel said that she could say prophecies that don't make sense, and not the future. Piper was weirded out and Rachel laughed, saying everyone found it creepy but insisted she was harmless. She explained she was in the cabin because she could sense there was a link between Percy's disappearance and Hera. When Annabeth talked about how she was redesigning

Chiron asked Rachel what happened, and she said she didn't remember, but she blacked out and Annabeth told her she spoke in a different voice. After Chiron asked, she said it wasn't a prophecy, but it felt like another power trying to speak through her. Rachel realize it was Hera after they talked and she was anxious after realizing Hera was imprisoned. Rachel later kept an eye on Piper while Annabeth went to take Jason to

They discussed her vision and Rachel told Piper the origins of Argus, and why he is sympathetic to Hera. She also said she isn't exactly sure what happened to Hera. When Piper began to almost cry, Rachel squeezed her arm and said that Jason is a good guy, and since he had a vision like hers, they were meant to work together. Piper cried, and Rachel reassured her that they'd figure it out. They also discussed who Piper's godly parent may be, and Rachel said that she hoped it was

   , Rachel hesitated, but said that the next Great Prophecy has begun, causing chaos and pandemonium. Rachel began saying the prophecy to those who haven't heard it, but to her surprise, Jason began saying it in Latin. She was shaken, and looked to Chiron for guidance, but there was nothing he could do to help her. She said that though they have no proof it was happening, she had a feeling, and she knew that some of the seven demigods were there tonight and some were not. She hoped it wouldn't happen for many years, but it started now. But what she did know was that Hera was missing. Rachel told the crowd about Jason's vision and about the incident at the Grand Canyon. She then asked Jason if he remembered his last name, and when he shook his head, she said they will just call him Jason, and that he was issued a quest to save Hera from a great evil. After Jason figured out his father was

She was the only one in the room not nervous about the conversation and said that Jason will help build the boat and then sail for Greece. She said that he would need the help of the Romans to defeat the giants, which

    Rachel showed signs of liking Percy, but is aware of Annabeth's feelings for him as well and calls Percy blind for not seeing it. When the two had to part, Rachel was happy when Percy told her he remembered her phone number and they would hang out. Rachel later asked him what it would take for the dumb guy to kiss the girl, and Percy finally realizes she liked him. They are interrupted however when Percy has to go on a mission, causing Rachel much stress and aggravation, to the point of tossing darts at a picture of Percy. However, she still came to his aid when she thought he was in trouble. While on Mount Olympus, Rachel thanks Percy for showing her the world of gods and monsters, but their destinies aren't linked, meaning they wouldn't have a romantic future together. Percy commented that he was dumped before they even started dating, but the two remain friends after Rachel becomes the Oracle.
