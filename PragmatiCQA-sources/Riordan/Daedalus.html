   warned the inventor not to give the Labyrinth a malevolent consciousness, but Daedalus ignored him. When he aided the hero

    Theseus
   </a>
   and
   Princess Ariadne
   (Minos' daughter), his treachery was discovered, as Minos had Daedalus and his son, Icarus, thrown in prison with little chance of escape. Daedalus, however, told his son: "although he blocks the lands and waves, the sky still opes its regions; thither let us go, for Minos may hold all in his power save the heavenly airs." He spoke, and turned his mind to arts unknown, reshaping nature to his will. He then began to craft a set of wings, placing the feathers in a row, with the shorter ones following the longer, as if they were growing on a slope. Then he bound the middle with thread and the bottom part with wax, and bent the feathers in a slight curve, so that it would imitate the wing of a genuine bird. Daedalus instructed his son: "I caution you, Icarus, to fly the middle path, lest, if you fly lower, the waves weigh down the feathers, and if higher, the sun's fire scorch them. You must fly between both perils; now, with me your guide, let us take to our journey!" As he taught these instructions of flying, he bound the wings to his shoulders. Between his labors and warnings, his old cheeks grew moist and his fatherly hands shook. He then gave his son a kiss, never to be given again, and, sustained by the feathers, he flew before and feared for his companion. Soon, when Icarus began to rejoice in this bold flight, he forsook his guide; drawn by the desire for the sky and aroused by their lofty ascent he drove his course higher and higher. But his nearness then to the sun caused the fragrant wax, the feathers' bonds, to melt. In vain, he shook his bare arms, and bereft of his means he could catch no wind, but, crying out his father's name, he was received into the sea.
  </p>
  <p key="146605e8-24f1-450b-902d-31d4194c8c31">
   Then Daedalus cried, "Icarus! Icarus! Where are you? In which place should I seek you, Icarus?" When he beheld the feathers afloat in the waves, he cursed his own arts which had wrought this doom. He buried the body in a grave, and that land which holds it is named, after the buried child,
   Icaria
   .

  <p key="09443f8d-296b-4f79-b054-9655bbb1c9ce">
   Years later, Daedalus went to live with his nephew,
   Perdix
   , and trained him in the ways of the mechanical arts. Although Perdix was fairly young, he showed signs of ingenuity and intelligence that could have in time rivaled even Daedalus himself. One day Perdix showed his uncle plans for a way to live forever by transferring your consciousness (called
   <i key="36585bba-e45d-45ac-8160-a6dff2d8f18a">
    animus
   </i>
   - Latin for

   </i>
   ) into an automaton. While Daedalus claimed it was impossible, Perdix showed him his notes on the subject, but Daedalus still claimed it wouldn't work. Eventually, Daedalus' jealousy over his nephew's brilliance turned to anger and he made an unforgivable decision. Daedalus challenged Perdix to a game of catch and while playing pushed him over the edge of a balcony. Athena saw this and transformed Perdix into a partridge. Then she cursed Daedalus and branded him with the mark of a murderer that would never fade.
  </p>
  <p key="95312a45-5584-4a0c-86e4-760684b21725">
   Daedalus spent years hiding in the palace of King Cocalus and serving as a teacher to his daughters. Meanwhile, Minos had not forgotten about him and in an effort to lure Daedalus out, he issued a challenge of wits. He would give a thousand gold talents to anyone who could thread a sea shell without breaking it. Daedalus couldn't refuse such a challenge, and found a way by tying a silk string to an ant and placing honey at the other end of the shell. When the news his challenge had been met reached Minos, he knew at once that he had found Daedalus. However, because Daedalus had been a kind teacher to the daughters of Cocalus and treated them as if they had minds of their own; the daughters killed King Minos in defense of their teacher. While the only person Daedalus really feared was now dead, he knew Minos would be waiting for him in the Underworld and he would never have a fair trial. He retreated into his Labyrinth, which had by then grown and taken on a life of its own. This way he would be able to hide from death forever. Then, using the notes Perdix had made, created a new body for himself. But the mark Athena had branded him with followed him into each new automaton body.

   Daedalus was incredibly intelligent, but could also be a coward at times. He tended to run and hide from his problems instead of facing them, even hiding from death itself for nearly two millennia. He was also a very sad and lonely person, claiming to only work for himself.
  </p>
  <p key="31c2edf6-c68a-4adf-a11a-7f672f0ed973">
   When he was younger (during his first lifetime), he loved to invent and considered the Labyrinth his greatest creation. He prided himself so much on his intelligence, that when his
   nephew
   began to show signs of being even smarter than he was, he became jealous and bitter, eventually leading him to kill the young boy.

   When confronted about his flaws however, he is able to do the right thing and even sacrificed himself to save others, even knowing he would not receive a fair trial in the Underworld thanks to Minos, as the King had become one of the Underworld Judges, being a son of Zeus and having experience with law and order.

   In his first body, Daedalus was an older man with long hair with streaks of gray, as well as a curly beard. While in Minos' prison, Daedalus was very thin and his hands were raw and red from years of work. His tunic was also covered in grease.

   While disguised as Quintus, Daedalus appeared to be in his fifties. He had short gray hair and a clipped gray beard. He dressed in black mountain-climbing pants and a bronze breastplate strapped over his Camp Half-Blood t-shirt. When meeting him again in his workshop, he was dressed in jeans and boots, but still had on the camp t-shirt. He had a sword by his side at all times.

   Daedalus is a master of many things, having had nearly two thousand years of practice in many things. He claims that while he is primarily an inventor, he is also an extremely skilled swordsman, an architect, a scholar, and is even good at basketball. His skill in swordplay is displayed by his ability to effectively train Percy one-on-one, even once disarming him. Also, because of his mechanical body, he is extremely hard to kill and he may not feel any pain at all. While he does bleed, if injured, it is actually golden oil instead of blood. He presumably originally had the regular powers of a demigod before he started using the body of an automaton.
