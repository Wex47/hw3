    It's not easy being Apollo, especially when you've been turned into a human and banished from Olympus. On his path to restoring five ancient oracles and reclaiming his godly powers, Apollo (aka Lester Papadopoulos) has faced both triumphs and tragedies. Now his journey takes him to Camp Jupiter in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the Roman demigods are preparing for a desperate last stand against the evil Triumvirate of Roman emperors. Hazel, Reyna, Frank, Tyson, Ella, and many other old friends will need Apollo's aid to survive the onslaught. Unfortunately, the answer to their salvation lies in the forgotten tomb of a Roman ruler . . . someone even worse than the emperors Apollo has already faced.

They are not able to come up with a second option. Apollo suggests that the demigods hack away at the imperial gold chains on the doors, but this would take hours. Reyna suggests that she lends Apollo her power to open the door and he agrees. This fulfills the line of the prophecy since Bellona's daughter is still technically opening the doorway.

The zone of silence is broken and the girls see purple streaks on Apollo’s skin. Meg then hears the ravens returning.

   to find Meg leading the unicorns into battle who are outfitted with the Swiss Army like weapons on their horns. She notices something was wrong when she saw his face but leaves the topic alone. When they realize what Tarquin’s target is, they rush to find Hazel. They find her and Arion fending off a hoard of the undead. She defeats them and realizes something happened with Frank and sends Arion to Caldecott Tunnel. They reach the bookstore to find Tarquin interrogating Aristophanes about the Sibylline Books. When Tarquin notices the trio he congratulates Apollo for killing the emperors. Tarquin then forces him to reveal the location of the prophecies on Tyson’s skin. He then snaps his fingers unleashes more of his hoard. Only nothing happens and Aristophanes attacks Tarquin‘s face. Hazel fights the undead king and Meg takes on the Zombies. As Apollo slowly becomes a zombie, he and the Arrow of Dodona sing Neil Diamond’s “Sweet Caroline” to try and slow the process. Just as Hazel stabs Tarquin,

   arrives and finishes Tarquin off before healing Apollo. When he is healed, they exit the bookstore to find the hunters mingling with the last of the legion and citizens of New Rome. He sees Thalia Grace and shares a moment of grief with her. He then sees Lavinia, who reveals she destroyed the fleet on Reyna’s orders. Reyna hobbles over on crutches and confirms this. It is also revealed that Lavinia has taken her mother’s shoes. Apollo and his sister talk briefly before Arion returns with Frank Zhang. Frank is revealed to be still alive but passes out when he dismounts.

   Frank is rushed to the medical tent to be tended to and they manage to save him. Hazel and Apollo stay at his bedside and theorize about his survival because he created his own destiny, as opposed to the last man whose life depended on a stick. Frank wakes up and Hazel hugs him. He explains that Ella told him how to kill the emperors and he went with it, freeing him of his curse. Apollo leaves them alone and scouts out the wounded and dead. He finds Don, who stayed on the ships to make sure their sabotage worked, nearly dead. They share a brief conversation before Don dies and is reincarnated as a laurel tree. Apollo tells the nature spirits to find a good spot to plant it.

   Over the next few days what remains of the legion and citizens of New Rome clean up the city. A mass funeral was held for those who died. During the funeral, Thalia spoke with Apollo and says she does not blame him for Jason's death. Reyna interrupts and she and Apollo walk to the
   Senate House
   . She explains that she has always been a leader and those around her have tried to pair her up with someone or she has tried to woo others. She says that what Venus told her upset her until Apollo's proposal for a relationship made her realize how much of a fool she has been.

   At the meeting, Frank congratulated the remaining members of the legion and citizens of New Rome. After the noise has died down, Reyna announces her resignation as praetor and joins the

   . Hazel is then selected by the legion to take her place to which she accepts. In response to this, Hazel has Lavinia to take her place as the fifth cohort’s
   centurion
   , which she accepts. Meg and Apollo are given gifts of thanks. Apollo was given
   his bow
   from when he was a god and Meg is given a pouch of ancient seeds. Unfortunately, they didn't have a replacement combat ukulele. Meg reveals that they plan to set out in the morning. Before that, they go to the Mess Hall to celebrate their victory and Apollo’s mortal birthday

   In the morning, Apollo and Meg say their goodbyes to Frank, Hazel, Thalia, Reyna, Bombilo, and Lavinia before heading to the bookstore, now called
   Cyclops Books
   , to get a prophecy from Ella before heading out. The prophecy they receive is shorter then Apollo though, saying:

   Apollo is confused at how short it is until he realizes that it's a terza rima, a form of poetry invented by Dante. The first and third lines rhyme but the second line rhymes with the first line of the second stanza. They realize that they will find the second stanza at their destination, the
