   On

   , in a cave at the base of Mount Ida, Rhea gave birth to her sixth and final child. His name would be Zeus. Rhea gave her newborn son to the nine nymphs that attended his birth (including
   Hagno
   ), and returned to Mount Orthys. She used a huge smooth boulder the same size and shape as a newborn (given to her by

   ) to deceive Kronos, by wrapping it up in swaddling clothes, and pretending that it was her final child. Kronos swallowed it without even looking (which gave him an intense stomachache), and was successfully deceived. Throughout his childhood, Zeus was raised by Rhea (who visited him often), the nine nymphs, the loud Kouretes, and the goat
   Amaltheia
   . Rhea would often tell Zeus about his brothers and sisters, all of whom he was destined to rescue from his father's stomach.

With the help of his great singing and dancing skills (as well as his knowledge of many outrageously hilarious "satyr jokes"), Zeus was able to constantly entertain all of the Titans at Mount Othrys, even Kronos himself. Shortly thereafter, Zeus encouraged all of the male Titans to participate in drinking contests. As the Titan King of Mount Othrys, Kronos would always win, since he could not let his siblings or nephews overcome him in anything. Finally, the Titan King began trusting Zeus completely, which is exactly what the latter was waiting for.

As before, Zeus entertained them all with his excellent singing, wild Kouretes' dance moves, and outrageously hilarious satyr jokes. Near the end of the Titanic banquet, Zeus encouraged all of the Titans to have yet another drinking contest, and handed out the prepared goblets. As before, Kronos won the contest, but Zeus' emetic was so powerful, that it forced him to instantly disgorge all of the contents of his stomach, in reverse order of swallowing: first the boulder, then

However, the gods overcame their fear, and were able to sneak in. Zeus managed to talk to the Cyclopes Brontes, and convinced him to forge powerful weapons for him and his siblings behind Kampê's back. The three Elder Cyclopes forged three incredibly powerful weapons: the Master Bolt (for Zeus), the Trident (for Poseidon), and the Helm of Darkness (for Hades). With these weapons, Zeus killed Kampê, and Poseidon shattered the chains of the Elder Cyclopes and Hekatonkheires, releasing them. Afterwards, Hades safely guided his siblings and uncles back out of Tartarus. In return, for their release, all six of Zeus' uncles agreed to fight on his side in the upcoming war with the Titans.

   , which infuriated him, as he could not bear to hear her suffering such a harsh punishment. As a result, he finally set her free. Hera tearfully embraced him, and promised to never to call Hephaestus ugly ever again. Zeus, however, was infuriated. Hence, he violently stormed into Hephaestus' chambers, easily overpowered him, and flung Hephaestus all the way from Mount Olympus to Lemnos (which broke every bone in his body). In time, however, Hephaestus' wounds were healed, and he returned to Olympus. Zeus was somewhat ashamed of his past angry fit with his son, and (in a rare act) apologized and welcomed his son back with open arms.

   , the Cyclopes son of Poseidon, Zeus gives the position of General of the armies of Olympus. To Percy, Zeus offers the ultimate gift of immortality ― to become a god and a Lieutenant to Poseidon. He is incredulous and rather furious when Percy (after much thought) denies the gift and asks for a different wish instead. Percy asks Zeus and the Olympian Council to swear on the

   first to be assured that his wish would be granted. Zeus and the other Olympians reluctantly agree to grant Percy's request as long as it was within their power. Percy, satisfied with this promise, asks them to pay more attention to their demigod children by showing them who is a demigod at the age of 13, to honor the minor gods, and to allow the minor gods to have

   and minor gods wouldn't have turned to Kronos' side. Percy adds that the oath of the Big Three to abstain from having children should be dissolved as it was never truly effective in the first place, and that any children the three mighty brothers may have from their affairs with mortals should be trained and accepted instead of feeling abandoned. Though somewhat outraged at such huge a request, Zeus and the Olympians nevertheless agree to fulfill it, although this promise is not really kept.

   If Zeus imagines that he is being plotted against or insulted, he can be very unforgiving. Zeus often allows his negative traits to override his better judgment. Zeus decisions are not always based on justice, but rather his personal whims and what he sees as best for himself, rather than the greater good. In some ways Zeus is lustful for power; it is evident in his title as king of the gods and his fear of his own brothers betraying or dethroning him.

  </p>
  <p key="3abd4520-44ac-4f8d-badb-21ebf8ed55b5">
   However, it should be noted that there are numerous differences between his novel version and film version. For instance, the novel Zeus is described as having black hair, a grey-and-black beard, and electric blue eyes, but in the film, his hair and beard are dark strawberry-blond, and his eyes are stormy green. The film Zeus also does not wear a suit like his novel version (except at the very beginning), but wears Grecian armor like the other gods.
  </p>
  <p key="1ec82136-beba-400e-865d-fc2783132211">
   Last but not least, the film Zeus was portrayed to be more easy-going than his novel version, though no less intimidating and law-enforcing when need be. It was revealed that he had passed the law forbidding the gods from having physical contact with their mortal children because his brother, Poseidon, was becoming increasingly human and less concerned with his divine responsibilities whenever he was with Sally (his mortal lover) and Percy (his half-mortal child), and Zeus believed it to be a negative influence, and presumably feared that the same thing would happen to the other gods should they continue to have physical interaction with their mortal children. He was also able to silence the entire Olympian Council when they were in the midst of a heated argument with just a simple command.
  </p>
  <p key="8f8fc1a6-316f-4f2a-9219-4c9af0f593eb">
   However, it was shown that Zeus could be agreeable: after Percy returned his Master Bolt and explained the truth of the theft, he actually praised Percy, agreed to Percy's request to return Grover from the Underworld, and even permitted Poseidon to speak and have physical contact with his son. Percy himself later discovered that, not only was Grover returned to him safe and sound, but that Zeus had promoted him to the rank of senior protector. Hence, it could be said that the film focused on bringing out a kinder and more generous side of Zeus, especially since in the novels, Zeus's only thanks to Percy for returning the Master Bolt was sparing his life.
