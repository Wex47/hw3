    So begins Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, in which the son of Poseidon adds his own magic--and sarcastic asides--to the classics. He explains how the world was created, then gives readers his personal take on a who's who of ancients, from Apollo to Zeus. Percy does not hold back. "If you like horror shows, blood baths, lying, stealing, backstabbing, and cannibalism, then read on, because it definitely was a Golden Age for all that."

   as a powerful god who would reward them if they treated him nicely but punished them if not. One example of this was Salmoneus, a prince of Thessaly with six brothers who made their own kingdoms. Salmoneus honored himself before the gods. He even pretended that he was actually Zeus to get food. When people accused him of being a fraud, the real Zeus came down and killed Salmoneus and destroyed Salmonea as some residents offered him food and believed him. Once he even tried to destroy the

Typhoeus ripped his tendons out and stole his lightning bolts, but when Hermes, Aegipan, and other gods returned to Zeus, he got an idea. After Aegipan lured Typhoeus with his panpipes, the latter got out Zeus' tendons for a harp then fell asleep. Hermes returned Zeus his tendons and bolts, then trapped Typhoeus under Mount Etna by crushing him with it after zapping him.

In order to make him immortal, she put Erikthonius in a chest with a snake and gave it to the daughter of King Kekrops. But the curiosity caused them to open the chest and got freaked out so much they jumped to their deaths. Erikthonius did not become immortal, but he did overthrow Kekrops when he grew up.

   Epimetheus

   and returned him when he turned five. Smyrna refused to worship Aphrodite, so the goddess made her pregnant and her father chased her until she turned into a myrrh tree. The tree gave birth to a baby boy named Adonis, whom Aphrodite gave to Persephone. When he grew up the goddesses fought over his custody, so Zeus decided that he'd spend one-third of the year with one of the goddesses while the remaining third he'd be on his own. Aphrodite and Adonis had a daughter named Beroe, and the goddess turned him into anemones after he was killed by a boar.
