   , Isis hid the infant Horus away and began training him to avenge his father's death and reclaim the throne as pharaoh of Egypt. When he came of age, Horus eventually recovered the casket in which his father was imprisoned. However, before he could free Osiris, Set destroyed the casket, scattering its remains all across Egypt. Enraged, Horus attacked his uncle, facing off against Set in a series of battles, in which he ultimately emerged victorious. Set was then driven out to the desert, far beyond Egypt's borders, as Horus assumed the throne as the new pharaoh. As pharaoh, Horus reinstated much of his parents' policies, and eventually reunited Egypt, for which he came to be known as

In some stories, the various forms of Horus (baby, teenager, and adult) represented the path of the sun, with the infant Horus being the sun at dawn, teenager at noon, and adult at dusk. Furthermore, stories differed as to what Horus' exact parentage is. Some claim him to be the son of Isis while others state he is the son of Nut. But mostly, it has been organized that Horus was reborn to Isis and Osiris during the ages.

Horus helps Carter come up with the idea of shadow execration to stop Apophis, but he doesn't know much about magic saying he mostly just focuses on hitting an enemy directly until they're destroyed.

Horus later takes up the throne of the gods again and Carter thinks he ripped off Carter's own acceptance speech.​​

   possibly showing a deep level of trust in Carter. However, Horus is shown to have a limited understanding of magic, something he freely admits himself and tells Carter his mindset is to attack an enemy until they are dead which Carter points out is not actually very useful. He prefers brute force and tends to irritate Carter by his insistence all the time on merging with Carter again to use brute force on the current enemy. Horus also doesn't understand sarcasm, as shown when Carter sarcastically agrees with him that pigeons are noble and he thinks Carter really means it. While he is a bit pushy in some instances, such as trying to get Carter to give him control and later merge with him again, he seems to respect people's decisions better than Isis as he never pushed too hard and accepted the decision, though he would try to show or explain his reasons for wanting what he did. Horus is fond of winged animals, having an affinity for the falcon, presumably due to his ability to turn into one. When he comes to visit Carter, he takes a pigeon as his host, saying that he wanted a falcon but settled for the pigeon instead as it had wings and he considered it noble. This affinity is also shown by his connection to
   griffins
   : he uses them to pull his chariot in battle and they obey his commands and by extension, anyone with a connection to him such as Carter Kane. When he leaves Carter without saying goodbye, Carter wonders if Horus was being callous, that he simply was using him the entire time and discarded him when he had no further use for him. However, Bast indicates that callousness was not behind this, saying not to take that action personally. As Isis did the same to Sadie, this is likely true. Horus also seems to lack creativity: he attacks his enemy until they are defeated which caused him to war with Set for years before defeating him and during his acceptance speech as leader of the gods once more, he seems to rip off his former host Carter's speech as pharaoh of the House of Life.
