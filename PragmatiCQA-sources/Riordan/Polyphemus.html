   Polyphemus was a character in Homer's
   <i key="206847fe-b150-4a4d-aec2-49e3da1a8f65">
    The Odyssey
    .
   </i>
   When
   <a href="Odysseus.html" key="d18a356d-5d75-4ce1-80fb-62055fc42754" title="Odysseus">
    Odysseus
   </a>
   stopped at the island of the
   Cyclopes
   , he saw a cave and thought there might be food in it. He and some of his crew went to investigate. His sailors insisted on taking what was there and leaving, but Odysseus insisted on meeting the "person" who owned it all, thinking he would present a challenge to them.
  </p>
  <p key="827fbb5c-d56c-4633-a3c3-b145b9fed3d2">
   At sundown, Polyphemus let his sheep back into the cave before moving a massive stone to cover the door. When Odysseus and his men try offering him some of their food, he instead grabs two of the men, tears them apart, and eats them. He asks Odysseus what his name is, and the clever hero tells him his name is "Nobody". Odysseus then gets Polyphemus drunk on wine and puts him to sleep.
  </p>
  <p key="c482f261-aa47-4c41-8c5c-1c00ce2af709">
   While he slept, Odysseus and his remaining men took a large stick and sharpened the end of it (in some versions they charred it too), and stabbed it into Polyphemus' eye. The monster woke with a start and called for his brothers, but all he said was "Nobody has blinded me!", and so they thought he was merely stating the obvious and left him alone.
  </p>
  <p key="74033b50-03cc-48af-a81a-b3f28df147f6">
   Later, when Polyphemus lets his sheep out to graze, he reaches down and feels around them to make sure Odysseus and his men aren't on their backs. However, Odysseus tied himself and his men to the sheep's undersides and were able to escape. As they left the island on their ship, Odysseus bragged to Polyphemus that he had escaped and in his arrogance revealed his real name to the Cyclops. This allowed Polyphemus to ask
   <a href="Poseidon.html" key="6801263f-7691-413a-8b7a-ee7c0d2a8360" title="Poseidon">

  </p>
  <p key="605283c2-c463-42f4-8fa7-99c41e1d3c53">
   Sometime after this, Polyphemus stole the

   and hung it on a tree on his island (what happened to the other Cyclopes on the island is unknown; it's possible they moved to different islands). Along with making his island a paradise, it lured satyrs there in search of

   as other satyrs had. Instead of falling into a trap, he was able to make it all the way back to St. Augustine with Polyphemus on his trail. Percy saw all of this in a dream on his final day of school since Grover hastily made an empathy link between them, although he wasn't sure whether it had worked or not. He tried hiding in a
   bridal boutique
   while Polyphemus moved past, but the Cyclops came back and found him, but thought he was a female Cyclops because he was wearing a dress.

   Later, in Percy's next dream, Grover is in a
   cave
   and this time the two are able to communicate. Grover tells Percy that Polyphemus' blindness somewhat wore off; when he found Grover in the wedding dress, Polyphemus believed Grover was a female Cyclops and planned to marry him. Grover still needs to finish his dresses bridal train, and he is using this (along with Polyphemus's stupidity) as a distraction. He mentions to Percy that

They find that Clarisse already arrived here and was captured by Polyphemus and is about to be eaten by him for his wedding; however, she accidentally reveals Grover's true identity. Thus, Polyphemus decides to switch things around: Grover will be eaten for the wedding that will be held between Polyphemus and Clarisse at sundown.

   By riding on the underside of one of Polyphemus's sheep, Percy is able to make into the Cyclops's cave where Grover and Clarisse are imprisoned while Annabeth taunts and distracts Polyphemus with her magical

   and going under the name of "Nobody". Percy manages to free them, but just after he does, he hears Annabeth scream.

   Polyphemus had caught her somehow, but Percy gets his attention to save her by taking the blame himself. He, Clarisse, Grover, and Annabeth escape across a bridge (seen on the cover of the book) and they try to destroy it before Polyphemus makes it across, but he does make it anyway. He swats Grover and Clarisse aside but is overcome and knocked down but an enraged Percy.

   Percy is urged by his friends to kill the monster, but then he recalls how Polyphemus is a son of Poseidon, just like Tyson and himself, and how killing him would be like killing Tyson. Percy threatens that he will kill the Cyclops if he gets up and starts to back away, but Polyphemus instead swats Percy back. However, just as he is about to kill and eat him, someone throws a rock into his mouth instead and the Cyclops falls into a chasm. That "someone" is revealed to be Tyson, who survived the explosion of the

   (Blackbeard's ship, which Percy and Annabeth 'borrowed' from him on
   Circe's island
   ). However, Polyphemus, who somehow survived the fall, chases after them. While Clarisse, Grover, and Annabeth board the ship, Percy and Tyson fight their half-brother, and Polyphemus urges Tyson to stay with him and learn to be a "real Cyclops". However, Tyson replies by saying, "You are not my kind," and continues helping Percy. They overcome him but Percy still cannot kill him, and instead, they merely leave him and keep swimming for the ship.
  </p>
  <p key="c22cf088-31e3-4c0f-b8dc-e23b2eacedbf">
   Just as it seems they are finally about to escape, Clarisse begins taunting Polyphemus from the ship. Using the position of her voice as a guide, Polyphemus is able to throw a rock into the ship and sink it. Luckily, Percy and Tyson call up Rainbow and his friends to carry them away from the island. As they are moving away, Percy hears Polyphemus gloating about how he finally sank "Nobody". Percy hopes that he never finds out he's wrong.

   With the disappearance of the Golden Fleece from Polyphemus's island, it likely went back to what it was before, although it should be noted that in The Odyssey, the island was never really described as ugly or desolate.

He is horrible at math and apparently doesn't even know what a mango is. Despite these negative traits, he was shown to be nice to Grover when he thought the latter was a female Cyclops and they would be getting married.

   When Percy first sees Polyphemus, he describes him as "huge, so huge he couldn't even fit into the room" and "made Tyson look vertically challenged" with arms the size of Percy. Thus, Polyphemus is at least fifteen feet tall. He has jagged yellow teeth and gnarled hands as big as Percy's entire body. Polyphemus is apparently very fat and overweight from having eaten an endless amount of things (mainly satyrs), and he was first seen wearing a faded purple t-shirt that says, "GRAND SHEEP EXPO 2001" When he sees him the second time he is wearing a baby-blue wedding tuxedo and kilt, like he'd skinned a whole wedding party. Although it is never mentioned in the book, his eye is most likely green, since it is seen on the cover of
