While certainly sardonic, and taunting, Apophis does not possess the sarcasm or wit of Set, another (former) enemy. He does not ever use slang, and his taunts are generally restricted to psychological torment or gloating. According to Set, Apophis prefers to fight his own battles and is not one to share power or prestige with anyone. That said, this does not stop him from manipulating others, even gods, to his goals. He cares nothing for his demon minions, viewing them as nothing more than tools to be used, and disposed of as necessary.
