    , a five-year high school that graduates the best marine scientists, naval warriors, navigators, and underwater explorers in the world. Ana's parents died while on a scientific expedition two years ago, and the only family's she's got left is her older brother,
    Dev
    , also a student at HP. Ana's freshman year culminates with the class's weekend trial at sea, the details of which have been kept secret. She only hopes she has what it'll take to succeed. All her worries are blown out of the water when, on the bus ride to the ship, Ana and her schoolmates witness a terrible tragedy that will change the trajectory of their lives. But wait, there's more. The professor that accompanied them informs Ana and the other freshmen that their rival school, Land Institute, and Harding-Pencroft have been fighting a cold war for a hundred and fifty years. Now that cold war has been turned up to a full broil, and the freshman are in danger of becoming fish food. In a race against deadly enemies, Ana will make amazing friends and astounding discoveries about her heritage as well as having to put up with Gemini Twain as her bodyguard, as she puts her leadership skills to the test for the first time.

   The story begins on the last Friday of
   Ana Dakkar
   's freshmen year. As is her daily routine, she wakes up at five a.m. changes into a bikini and heads to the cliffs looking out onto the
   Pacific Ocean
   , where her brother,
   Dev
   is waiting for her with two dead squid. Dev jumps into the water first, which would mean he'd see Socrates, the dolphin they were planning on feeding the squid too, first.
  </p>
  <p key="14a5b65c-0aff-461e-96d5-df2ee4b3df23">
   Socrates seems more agitated then normal, and after a few minutes Ana notices the security grid that outlines the bay flicker, which has never happened before. After going back to the surface, she tells Dev, but he reassures her that it's probably not a problem, but that he would report it. He then gives her their mother's old pearl pendant, which he had recast as an early birthday gift.

   isn't at breakfast, but chalks it up as him reporting the flicker in the grid like she asked him to. She then goes back to her dorm, where her roomates,
   Nelinha da Silva
   and
   Ester Harding
   , accompanied as usual by Ester's dog,
   Top
   , are packing for their Freshmen Trials. Once they are done, they head outside, where Ana sees Dev's girlfriend, Amela Leahy, on the grass with some other seniors, who tells her 'good luck' in sign language.

   When they arrive at the bus,
   Gemini Twain
   is the only other student there, checking attendance. He and Ana exchange sarcastic remarks before the girls board the bus. Ana is happy to see their driver is Bernie, a retired navy that she likes, but is displeased to see their teacher chapparone is Dr. Hewett, the Theoretical Marine Science teacher, who Ana thinks is much too out of shape to chaparone the trials. They sit on the back of the bus. The bus starts moving and they pass all of the security, and soon they are on the highway, which gives them a great view of the school. Thirty minutes away from San Alejandro, where the boat they will take on their trials, the

   , is docked, Dr. Hewett starts briefing the freshman class on their trials. Once he is done, it is Gemini's turn to speak, and he tells them they will be in five groups of four, with one person from each house, but doesn't tell them the groups before listing off rules as he expects his classmates to abide during the trials.
  </p>
  <p key="a32484d8-7323-41e6-86f7-0e9ae83a7a4d">
   Gemini never gets to tell them the groups, as while he is speaking, Ana notices what looks like a torpedo in the water heading for the cliffs Harding-Pencroft is standing on. A few moments later, an the bus is hit by a shock-wave, causing an 'earthquake'. Bernie gains control of the bus, but when he finally pulls over, they can only watch Harding-Pencroft begin to crumble into the ocean. They are hit by another shock-wave, and then Harding-Pencroft is completely submerged in the San Francisco bay..
  </p>
  <p key="b2ce4f13-4acf-4f4e-af89-6047ee997977">
   In panic and shock, the freshmen, plus Top, Dr. Hewett, and Bernie, run out of the bus and watch from the cliff. After a few minutes of panic, Ana anounces that she saw the attack, and informs them about the incident with the grid that morning.  Gemini tells everyone to get back on the bus so that they can go back and look for survivors, but Dr. Hewett intergects, saying that the freshmen trials still need to take place, so he and Bernie send drones out to search for survivors. Ana read Bernie's lips as he talked to Dr. Hewett, mentioning "Inside Help". The professor also says that he was expecting an attack like this, and that it must be from
   Land Institute
   , their rival school, and then gives Gemini the mission of protecting Ana at all cost, much to everyone's surprise and confusion.

  <p key="ebd4c8a3-897b-47a3-8c0f-8b49b1f1392d">
   While they continue to the San Alejandro docks, Gemini sits in the back of the bus with Ana, Nelinha, and Ester, and tells them that he believes the four of them are the best in their respective houses. They soon conclude that there had to be a traitor at Harding-Pencroft, and seeing as the only people who left the school that day were the people on the bus, someone on the bus had to be a traitor.
  </p>
  <p key="ec76b1ea-4ed2-4631-a18f-bf5cde48e307">
   When they arrive at the docks where their boat, the
   <i key="d2acdcfc-76ab-49cf-b052-8a256ea5c823">
    Varuna
   </i>
   , is moored, Ana pulls the other members of House Dolphin aside while the rest of the freshmen unload the cargo, and tells them about the suspicions of a traitor in Irish, their years' dolphins' chosen secret language. Virgil Esparza informs them that Dr. Hewett used to work at Land Institute, which led to some more suspicions.
  </p>
  <p key="ab34c568-e172-4ce5-80d7-d667b791398e">
   A few moments later, Dr. Hewett gathers the students. Ana lip-reads the words "buy us time" directed to some security guards, which then board Bernie's bus and drive off. Dr. Hewett then announces that this is no longer a weekend trip, but an indefinate assignment, and that all of them are in danger. Rhys Morrow asks if they can contact their families, as they will think them dead, but he argues it would be safer for them and their families for them to be believed dead.  He then notices something on his tablet, and orders them to leave.
