   Set, also called Seth, was born on the third

   , which would awaken him. After his rebirth, Set married his former sister, Nephthys and fathered an estranged son named Anubis with her. When Osiris became king of the gods, Set refused to stand for it and planned to kill him. During the king's birthday celebration, he trapped Osiris inside a magnificent sarcophagus and poured molten lead into it. Declaring himself ruler, he relentlessly pursued a pregnant Isis who would give birth to a reborn Horus and resurrect Osiris. Although Osiris could not be truly revived, Horus would go on to avenge his father's murder by dethroning Set.

   Set was originally a major god of Upper Egypt. He was viewed as a benevolent god and protector, though he has a long history of feuding with Horus. When Upper and Lower Egypt merged, the followers of Horus gained power and increasingly demonized Set. He went from being a chief god to Ra's protector, to being merged with Apophis. Despite this, he was still in some areas a major god and has had several revivals.

Set indicates that he simply exists as a balance to the other gods who are good as he is a god of evil and that he is a necessary evil. However, Set reminds Carter that he used to be Ra's lieutenant and assures him that the last thing he wants is Apophis to win, saying that between Ra and Apophis, he'd take Ra every time.

Carter uses this as proof to the rebels that they are not evil.

   Set is arrogant, cunning, cruel, manipulative, and enjoys toying with his enemies often for his own personal entertainment. As the god of evil, Sadie described Set as being ruthless, and cruel, to which he sarcastically replies, "You make me blush, Sister." Set's first concern is always himself and he even is willing to submit to his enemies if it is in his best interest, like he initially did with Menshikov. Ironically, while he was able to manipulate Amos by partially possessing him, Set himself was being manipulated by Apophis, his former mortal enemy, through Face of Horror. When Set finally realizes this at the end of

   Path of the Gods
   , he chooses to follow the Path of Set, drawing on Set for power and apparently communicating with him. Set works with Amos against Apophis, willingly sharing his power and it's indicated visiting Carter to ease his worries at Amos' request. During the final battle, Set takes Amos as a host again, but this time with Amos in control with Set seeming to mostly let him except when he tries to have "fun" by killing people, but Amos is able to keep him under control, something that is supposed to be impossible.
