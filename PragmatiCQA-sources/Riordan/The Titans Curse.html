There the General creates skeletal warriors, which are almost impossible to destroy, by putting dinosaur teeth — dragon teeth, in actuality — into the soil and watering it with blood. Their original purpose was to kill Zoë and Bianca. The General is about to give them a cloth to get the Hunters' scent when Percy grabs it. However, the skeletons tear a chunk out of Percy's sleeve and inhale his scent, making him their target.

He finds astronaut food in a gift shop and throws them into the Nemean Lion's mouth. The Nemean Lion is disgusted by the freeze-dried delectables and opens its mouth long enough for Zoë to shoot an arrow at it.

   Finding a truck in the junkyard, Thalia drives until they reach a river. There, they find some canoes, and Percy convinces a group of
   Naiads
   to steer them to the Hoover Dam. Percy, Thalia, and Grover begin spouting facts about the Dam, indicating just how close their relationship is to Annabeth, as the
   Hoover Dam
   was one of her personal favorites. After making some 'dam'
   jokes
   , Percy gets separated from the group when he hears and approaches the Ophiotaurus. The 11 remaining skeletal warriors attack him, and as he tries to escape, he ends up with a tour group inside an elevator. As the group leaves the elevator, Percy is alone with the tour guide, who turns out to be

   . Because she is mortal, the blade passes right through her, as if it is an illusion. She saves Percy by confusing the skeletons, allowing Percy to escape to his friends. The group gets trapped on the dam but are saved when the giant metal angel statues given to Zeus by Athena carry them off after Thalia prays to her father.

   , Percy wrestles
   Nereus
   , the Old Man of the Sea, and learns that Bessie the Ophiotaurus is the monster Artemis is seeking, for burning its entrails will give a person the power to destroy Olympus. Dr. Thorn appears with a small force of mortals, and he tries to convince Thalia to wield the Ophiotaurus' power. Percy manages to shake her out of her stupor, and as they are cornered, they manage to get an Iris message to Camp Half-Blood and see Dionysus, the camp director. He saves them after Percy reluctantly asks for help. Grover then takes the Ophiotaurus back to Long Island with Poseidon's help after Percy sacrifices the lion's pelt to Poseidon.

Dr. Chase lends them his car, and before they leave, Percy makes a promise to Mrs. Chase to tell Annabeth that she still had a home there. As they drive up the mountain, the car explodes due to a lightning bolt that Kronos threw to make Thalia angry at her father.

   They complete the rest of the climb on foot to the Garden of the

   , where Zoë meets her sisters and is poisoned by the dragon,
   Ladon
   . They continue to the place where Atlas used to hold up the sky, and they see Artemis taking on his burden. Annabeth is bound and gagged by Luke and Atlas. Realizing that the prophecy made by the Oracle involved him, Percy takes the burden of the Titan's curse from Artemis.

   , the rival capital of Mount Olympus, rebuilding itself. This could only mean that the Titans' chances of triumph are increasing. Atlas kills his daughter by throwing her against the rocks. Artemis kicks Atlas back under the weight of the sky, as only a Titan can be forced to bear the sky and the impact pushes Percy backward. The sky smashes against Atlas' back before he struggles to his knees, pinning him to the ground. In a battle between Thalia and Luke, Luke falls into a chasm; Percy assumes that Luke is dead, but it is later confirmed by Poseidon that the traitorous demigod had survived. Before leaving Mount Tam, Artemis turns Zoë into a constellation — the Huntress — as both a reward for the latter's services and as a reminder to the world of her existence. They then go to

Percy experiences discomfort before she makes her decision, as he assumed that it would be Annabeth joining the Hunters. Ares and Athena suggest that the gods kill Percy because he will be the next child of the prophecy after two years. Fortunately, many of the gods vote to let the heroes live after Artemis declares that if the heroes are punished, then the gods are no better than the Titans.

   After partying with the gods, the group returns to camp. Percy tells Nico about Bianca's death and gives him the figurine of Hades, that Bianca meant to give to Nico. Nico throws the statuette away and tells Percy that he hates him for not saving his sister.
