   Alex lived in a three story mansion in either Lexington or Salem. White painted columns were at the entrance, and honeysuckle bushes were planted in the front yard. There was also a porch, and an American flag rippled on the porch.
  </p>
  <p key="747cf92a-6389-4cc2-8f4c-8acd33b95a04">
   Alex spent her life being resented for both her Norse heritage and her gender fluidity by both mortal parents. He would be bullied, both verbally and physically, by his classmates and berated by his father while his mortal step-mother did nothing to prevent this domestic abuse. Her parents resented her and thought she was embarrassing, and his stepmother was not happy to have him there. They told Alex that Loki put ideas in his head and corrupted him, blaming him for being genderfluid. Her family was rich, but they didn't care about feelings and only a son and heir. Alex had other siblings, but their relationship was unknown, but her father thought of them as his "real" children. He also thought Alex's pottery was garbage and said she had so much potential, and wanted him to be normal in his twisted way.

  <p key="854b6f1c-755a-4e83-8b7c-2eb008fe05a9">
   She was very close to her Abuelo, an immigrant from Mexico, and he taught her pottery. He told her about old Mexican myths and legends, and talked to them about their heritage, saying how her family had been making pottery for centuries, before the Aztecs. His grandfather supported who she was as genderfluid and honored it, telling her about duality people with two faces, two aspects for each gender. Her and his grandfather also discussed ancestors sculptures, because her grandfather wanted to understand it and reclaim his heritage. This infuriated their father, saying that he was putting ideas in her head, and hated that he was finding validation from their family.
  </p>
  <p key="ae18acff-a5db-4532-b4af-ee4a2ae59cc7">
   Alex hated her father's pottery business, and called it crap, since it was machine made and not done the old way like her Abuelo. The company was big when Alex was around six, after her father took over and her Abuelo died, when her father made machine made silverware and home goods. Because of this, her father tried to make Alex into a businessman, grooming her to take over the company, discrediting her Abuelo's ideas, and destroying his art, but Alex didn't let him. He didn't understand why Alex didn't want to make money off of pottery and hated when she listened to her Abuelo's legends. He made millions and it was a big name, until they realized the quality was going downhill and it became unpopular.
  </p>
  <p key="2b4ad057-41e1-4ecf-b273-432fd0d700ae">
   She was involved in a pottery studio at Brookline Village one point and went camping with the kids there often, going away in the mountains to "get away". It was the only consistent place for her, and the owners let her crash there when things got bad at home. Alex tried making a pottery man, but it failed.
  </p>
  <p key="78ae5b86-fecb-411b-81b1-bbdd90451816">
   As for Loki, she would show up and try to "parent" her. One day, he showed up at the pottery studio. He tried to impress her and show her how much he could do for her. He taught her an enchantment that could turn anything into a weapon. She didn't want the satisfaction of him helping her, so she used the spell on the stupidest thing she could think of: A clay cutter. She didn't think it could be a weapon, but it turned into her signature wire.

   When Alex was fourteen, about two years before becoming an einherji, Alex became homeless when her father threw down the stairs of the
   house
   in the front yard, and threw a sculpture Alex made at her, which had two faces. Her father told Alex that he just wanted her to be normal, and Alex insisted she was. Her father then said she would have no more help and no more money, which Alex rejected. Her father said she had so much potential, since she understood the craft as much as her Abuelo, and insulted her appearance, spitting on the steps. Alex corrected her father and said it was an art, not craft, and her father looked disgusted, and said her sculpture wasn't art, it was trash. They both waited for the other to apologize, but her father shook his head in dismay and slammed the door, disowning her.

   At some point in life, he lived in a youth shelter on Winter Street in Boston, at roughly the same time when Magnus was there. He remembers hating the place. Also during this time, Alex befriended a boy named
   Adrian
   , but he would end up killing himself. Alex was often beat up in homeless shelters often. She would occasionally steal from her family.

   Alex is a teenage einherji, and shares a lot of physical traits with her mother Loki. She is petite, as stated in the Hammer of Thor, with sharp and beautiful facial features and the same sly grin as the god of lies. She has heterochromia, with one dark brown and one pale amber eye, and her hair is dark at the roots but dyed green. She also has a tiny symbol of Loki tattooed on her nape. Magnus noted that Alex's physical appearance did not change when she was a boy, except for her hair, which actually seemed to be longer.

Tied around her waist like a kilt is a cashmere sweater, which conceals a garrote wire and a hunting knife tucked behind a belt. Her appearance has been compared to both a jester's motley and a venomous animal giving off warning signs.

Alex tends to act differently from one moment to the next with no particular motivation, especially to Magnus, going from a normal teasing friend to very flirty. Alex also wears a lot of outfits. Her feelings towards someone can change very quickly, like to Sif, when she went from hating her to valuing her as a friend.

She hates when people don’t respect her pronouns or call her an argr, and has lectured people about that term. Alex views herself as the same as everyone else, as she told her father in their last conversation, but likes to flaunt her weirdness. Her Abuelo also taught her to be proud of her Mexican heritage. It is likely from this, when she was brought into Valhalla, she feared she would be restricted to a single gender.

     Alex was born out of an affair between
     his/her father
     and Loki. After Loki opened their eyes to the nine worlds they were never the same again. Alex was abused by her father throughout her childhood for being a genderfluid demigod, and no one did anything to stop it. Mr. Fierro also hated that his father accepted her for who she was. Mr. Fierro abused her emotionally (and implied physically) so badly that Alex would have to escape to her Abuelo’s house. The two look alike, with Alex having her father's petite build. He also resented Alex for not wanting to take over the family business, and calling her pottery trash.

     When Alex was fourteen, her father snapped and threw pottery at her and threw her down the stairs, injuring and bruising her. Mr. Fierro told her to be normal, and if it was that hard, and Alex retorted that she was normal. Mr. Fierro expressed his disappointment, saying that she understood the craft of pottery just as much as her grandfather, but Alex corrected him, saying the art, not craft. Mr. Fierro then told her she wouldn’t get any money from him, and it would go to his real children, and Alex said she didn’t want his money. He then disowned her, and slammed the door of their house.

    Alex has hatred for her father, and says that he doesn’t have feelings and care about her at all. Alex has trauma from the abuse she was subjected to from him, and because of that, she had a hard time with other people and will assume that people won’t accept her. Alex is also sensitive about her past, and is uncomfortable telling people about him, except for
